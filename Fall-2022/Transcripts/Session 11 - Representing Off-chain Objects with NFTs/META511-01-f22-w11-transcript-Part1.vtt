WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:21.280
Okay.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.340
Hello, everyone.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.840
We are back in session.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.520
It is 2023 and we have two more sessions to go.

00:29.520 --> 00:38.080
I am excited to be doing today's session on off-chain or physical objects or claims that

00:38.080 --> 00:45.480
are linked to NFTs with the very, very well-known Chi Money, who is not just one of the great

00:45.480 --> 00:53.920
collectors of the space and he is a business builder in the space and has done a lot of

00:53.920 --> 00:55.640
interesting physical objects.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.920
So, first of all, welcome to the course, sir.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.680
Well, thank you for having me.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.040
It's a pleasure to be on and it's definitely an honor.

01:05.040 --> 01:11.960
So what we're going to do today is kind of a mix of a presentation and a discussion.

01:11.960 --> 01:20.160
I'd like to go VTE through a few background slides to make sure everyone gets up there.

01:20.160 --> 01:26.040
Make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of the concepts.

01:26.040 --> 01:33.080
Then we'll work through some examples and then, since we have the founder of a, actually,

01:33.080 --> 01:42.240
one of our example slides, dig into detail like why it was done this way, what's the

01:42.240 --> 01:45.440
opportunity or what does this look like over time.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.360
And so we'll go that way.

01:47.360 --> 01:54.560
And at any point, G Money, if I'm off-base on something or I didn't say something that

01:54.560 --> 01:58.600
you think should be out of just jumping even during the slides.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.600
Okay, great.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.600
Okay.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.680
Did I have control of the slides?

02:06.680 --> 02:11.920
I don't seem to have control of the slides.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.880
Huh.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.720
I do.

02:15.720 --> 02:26.760
I don't seem to be able to switch the slide.

02:26.760 --> 02:35.640
I think you might have control of the slides, I think.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.640
Yeah.

02:37.640 --> 02:38.640
Keep going.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.640
Yeah, keep going.

02:41.640 --> 02:43.640
Keep going.

02:43.640 --> 02:44.640
Keep going.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.640
All right.

02:45.640 --> 02:57.320
So the session of the course we titled it Off-chain Objects.

02:57.320 --> 03:00.200
And then I thought to myself, is that right?

03:00.200 --> 03:02.360
I mean, it's sort of, it is, of course, right.

03:02.360 --> 03:07.160
But I was also playing around with a couple of other words, physical objects, right?

03:07.160 --> 03:14.880
Because there's some things that are off-chain but digital, like, you know, are we right, PFS?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.720
That is true for a lot of NFTs.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.800
But I think that's something different than what we're discussing here.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.320
And then I was wondering even if the word objects was correct.

03:25.320 --> 03:30.320
And I think it's not, or it's partially correct, but it's not fully comprehensive.

03:30.320 --> 03:36.000
I think the right word is claims because we could be representing things that are not

03:36.000 --> 03:40.240
an object, but for example, could be an experience.

03:40.240 --> 03:48.240
If you have an NFT that represents a ticket to a concert or a night in a hotel room, it's

03:48.240 --> 03:49.240
not an object.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.320
You know, you haven't gotten the concert hall.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.360
But it is a claim in the physical world.

03:54.360 --> 04:02.040
And I think for the purpose of this session, that's my mental framework that we're talking

04:02.040 --> 04:07.400
about, you know, the other 11 sessions of the course we're talking about natively digital

04:07.400 --> 04:09.400
assets all the way through.

04:09.400 --> 04:14.560
This is the session where we're talking about physical matters.

04:14.560 --> 04:20.920
And physical in this case claims, which I think this is the right model.

04:20.920 --> 04:25.920
Now what type of things could they represent?

04:25.920 --> 04:33.720
And this is in no way an exhaustive list, exhaustive list is everything in the world.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.880
So I'm not going to start writing down every single thing in the world.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.800
But evident crypto a long time.

04:40.800 --> 04:48.560
And this idea of representing physical objects with crypto tokens predates NFTs.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.920
We've been talking about this for many, many years.

04:51.920 --> 04:56.720
A lot of people tried to do it with fungible tokens, they turned it with colored coins.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.480
And the areas that people typically start with the ones that I've heard over and over

05:01.480 --> 05:08.040
and over again, are no particular order real estate, clothing, precious stones or gold or

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
what have you.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
It's where people start, right?

05:10.040 --> 05:15.600
Because I think these are things that might have sufficient value that people think about

05:15.600 --> 05:22.720
them and they're easy enough to make the mental leap.

05:22.720 --> 05:27.160
Maybe someday are washing machine will be represented by NFT, but it's a harder mental

05:27.160 --> 05:30.120
leap to see how that works, right?

05:30.120 --> 05:37.600
So and then the claim may not just be ownership, right?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.400
Could be ownership.

05:39.400 --> 05:46.040
Could be that if you own this NFT, you own this physical object, do that.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.000
It could be rental.

05:48.000 --> 05:55.520
If you own the SINF T, you have access to this car or holiday home for this week.

05:55.520 --> 05:58.320
It could be access.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.560
If you own the SINF T, you can come to this country club.

06:02.560 --> 06:09.240
If you own the SINF T, you can go to this concert.

06:09.240 --> 06:13.520
If you own the SINF T, you can have dinner once a week with dream money.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.360
It's a physical claim, right?

06:17.360 --> 06:24.280
Redemption, which in all it's kind of similar to ownership, but I split it because I think

06:24.280 --> 06:26.520
it's a different implementation form.

06:26.520 --> 06:32.920
So there's people who say, well, you own the NFT and the NFT and the physical note together.

06:32.920 --> 06:38.080
And as long as you own an NFT and you can redeem the NFT for the physical and the NFT

06:38.080 --> 06:39.280
goes away, right?

06:39.280 --> 06:42.400
And so the first is almost like a gift voucher.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.400
It's not a good one.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.040
It's kind of like a gift voucher for a physical object.

06:46.040 --> 06:51.600
Whereas the redemption model is whereas the ownership model and they go together and they're

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
permanently together.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.200
The NFT never gets burnt.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.120
And you no longer have the physical object.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.000
You send the NFT to the next person.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.720
So the NFT and the physical object always live together.

07:03.720 --> 07:11.200
And then there's this, I was thinking about it, but it also exists in the art NFT world

07:11.200 --> 07:15.520
with some people have made blended or hybrid objects.

07:15.520 --> 07:21.080
I am absolutely not going to write the word digital in the presentation.

07:21.080 --> 07:29.320
But we bought a few of them recently and it's a beautiful NFT, but it also comes with a physical

07:29.320 --> 07:31.680
painting in a frame.

07:31.680 --> 07:40.520
And those are meant to be a unified piece of artwork, the NFT and the physical object

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
that comes with the art.

07:41.520 --> 07:48.720
I'm sure there are other examples than what I mentioned here, but I think this is the

07:48.720 --> 07:50.360
80%, 90% correct.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.800
I think we're going to think about it.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.960
I think you'd add here, Jimin.

07:55.960 --> 08:02.520
Yeah, I think to add one thing that I want to be immediately, the things that I thought

08:02.520 --> 08:07.520
of immediately as to what is an NFT that people can conceptualize really well is a mortgage.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.960
And to your point is like that's a claim.

08:10.960 --> 08:17.200
And it helps people understand to the point you made earlier that pretty much everything

08:17.200 --> 08:19.120
in the real world is an NFT.

08:19.120 --> 08:21.480
We just don't call them NFTs.

08:21.480 --> 08:26.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all correct.

08:26.120 --> 08:36.920
That we have that we work with abstracted claims on physical objects is absolutely true.

08:36.920 --> 08:43.320
For me, the one that I think users to describe to people is title deeds for real estate,

08:43.320 --> 08:44.320
right?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.400
You never transact the real estate itself.

08:46.400 --> 08:49.480
You transact a piece of paper.

08:49.480 --> 08:55.000
When you buy a house, you're not, even if you're buying a piece of land on a mountainside,

08:55.000 --> 09:00.680
the land doesn't know anything's changed, right?

09:00.680 --> 09:03.600
Maybe there's a fence, maybe there's a lot of fence, but nothing has changed the moment

09:03.600 --> 09:06.040
you buy it from someone.

09:06.040 --> 09:12.000
What has changed is we've shuffled around a piece of paper in someone's office.

09:12.000 --> 09:20.680
And then when we have accepted as a social construction that the person who has access

09:20.680 --> 09:26.720
to do things with that land is the person whose name and the county registrar's office,

09:26.720 --> 09:31.760
right, where the land registry in places where it's more centralized.

09:31.760 --> 09:38.640
And it is no more, but no less abstracted than how NFTs work, right?

09:38.640 --> 09:42.000
And because a lot of people say, oh, but NFTs are just making it up.

09:42.000 --> 09:47.040
There's no real linkage between NFT and there's no real linkage between the title deed and

09:47.040 --> 09:48.040
your land.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.600
The linkage is a social construction.

09:50.600 --> 09:58.120
And in the case of land, a set of laws and regulations that say, well, if I have this,

09:58.120 --> 09:59.240
I'm allowed to be here.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.800
And if G money comes into my field, I can ask him to leave.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.800
And if he does, I can call him the power of the state to get him out of here, right?

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
But the physical land doesn't know anything about this.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.800
It's just a piece of land, right?

10:09.800 --> 10:13.240
The thing that matters is the piece of paper in the office.

10:13.240 --> 10:19.520
And so I think one way to think about it is we're talking about replacing that piece

10:19.520 --> 10:25.200
of paper that is sitting in someone's filing cabinet or now on some databases where they

10:25.200 --> 10:28.400
publicly visible, transactable, composable, talking.

10:28.400 --> 10:29.400
All right.

10:29.400 --> 10:34.920
Let's go to the expansion.

10:34.920 --> 10:40.720
Now, physical claims do require a trusted counterparty, right?

10:40.720 --> 10:47.320
And this is the major difference from the rest of digitally native tokens.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.400
By the way, this is the way all society works, right?

10:50.400 --> 10:52.680
So this isn't a negative statement.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.280
This is the way how everything else in society works.

10:56.280 --> 11:03.680
But it's important that this is a really important topic because I've seen many white papers

11:03.680 --> 11:09.640
and presentations over the years that either don't understand this or like pretend not

11:09.640 --> 11:13.440
to understand this, but it's important and it's different.

11:13.440 --> 11:21.240
If I have a art blocks token in my wallet, okay, I have it in my wallet.

11:21.240 --> 11:24.200
I don't need any third party, right?

11:24.200 --> 11:27.120
And there, I mean, the code is on chain.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.040
Like literally everything is in my wallet.

11:29.040 --> 11:34.040
I can send it to you, you can send it back to me.

11:34.040 --> 11:40.920
At no point do we need to request someone to do something in order to own the art.

11:40.920 --> 11:50.960
Now, when we bought this funeral piece in an auction, well, they transferred the token,

11:50.960 --> 11:56.760
but then also now they have to ship the physical part.

11:56.760 --> 12:02.880
And so I have to trust that the seller, in this case, I trust them as an auction house,

12:02.880 --> 12:08.240
but like that the seller is capable of like packing it up correctly and mailing it to

12:08.240 --> 12:13.480
the right place and getting appropriate insurance and not breaking it and, you know, all of

12:13.480 --> 12:15.880
these things right there, the counterparty.

12:15.880 --> 12:21.160
And if we ever send it somewhere else, we have to do the same thing, right?

12:21.160 --> 12:25.880
There's sudden the counterparty in that case was the auction house was the seller.

12:25.880 --> 12:30.640
And generally, you can think about the counterparty.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.280
I think it's these three categories.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.640
Maybe there's a fourth that I missed.

12:34.640 --> 12:39.280
The most obvious one is the issuer of the claim, right?

12:39.280 --> 12:47.040
If 90cc says, I'm going, if you own this NFT, you get this piece of clothing.

12:47.040 --> 12:51.960
Well, the most obvious counterparty is the firm is going to say, I've showed up, I've

12:51.960 --> 12:55.840
redeemed the NFT, I've burned the NFT, I want my t-shirt, right?

12:55.840 --> 13:01.600
And so we have to trust that the t-shirts are there and you're well organized firm and

13:01.600 --> 13:04.920
you haven't lost them and you'll send them to the right place and all of these things,

13:04.920 --> 13:05.920
right?

13:05.920 --> 13:06.920
And the same thing is true.

13:06.920 --> 13:12.920
But this is our day to day life in the whole world, like when you booked a room at Marriott,

13:12.920 --> 13:19.520
you're trusting the issuer of that claim that, you know, the Marriott on Canal Street is

13:19.520 --> 13:20.920
in fact there and operating.

13:20.920 --> 13:25.720
And when you show up and you say, like, here's my reservation from booking.com, and there's

13:25.720 --> 13:33.400
a yes, Mr. 6'5", tonight, you have room 272 and the room's clean and it's available,

13:33.400 --> 13:35.240
there's not someone else in it, right?

13:35.240 --> 13:41.320
You're taking on a variety of counterparty risks that, as a general rule, married is

13:41.320 --> 13:46.040
very good at if they rent your room for a night, they will deliver the room for the

13:46.040 --> 13:47.040
rent you.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.880
No, and sometimes they must have the new book and the same person, right?

13:49.880 --> 13:52.560
There's a little bit of counterparty risk, there's not zero.

13:52.560 --> 13:58.680
But within boundaries that society operates, right, it operates more or less okay.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.080
That's one model, right?

14:00.080 --> 14:04.520
The issuer is the counterparty.

14:04.520 --> 14:09.160
Another model that you see, and some of these startups, we mentioned here, operate as well,

14:09.160 --> 14:10.160
there's a centralized custodian.

14:10.160 --> 14:18.320
And you're going to say, look, we're going to have, we're going to have gold bars as NFTs

14:18.320 --> 14:22.680
and diamonds as NFTs, and how do I know the diamonds really there?

14:22.680 --> 14:27.600
How do I trust that the person sends me the diamond that I bought?

14:27.600 --> 14:34.720
Well, me, the centralized firm that's operating this NFT, the product or marketplace, says,

14:34.720 --> 14:42.760
look, I have a big vault and all the diamonds are there and you guys can trade the NFTs

14:42.760 --> 14:45.680
and the diamonds are not going over, it's always here, right?

14:45.680 --> 14:50.240
It's always right here, and you can always come and then redeem it and claim it and get

14:50.240 --> 14:51.240
the diamond.

14:51.240 --> 14:59.840
And so you don't have to trust every single seller if they're going to deliver, right?

14:59.840 --> 15:03.280
You just need to trust the custodian, in fact, the diamonds are there.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.280
And this is how all financial markets work, right?

15:06.280 --> 15:12.640
I mean, when you're buying and selling shares of stock, they're held in a custodian, it

15:12.640 --> 15:16.520
changes, the shares never move just in reporting of who owns them.

15:16.520 --> 15:21.040
This is how literally the US stock market's working, it's a centralized custodian.

15:21.040 --> 15:28.840
And then there's one interesting idea I saw here and I'm sure we'll see more of this,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.760
where they're trying to build a network of decentralized custodians, right?

15:32.760 --> 15:37.720
So there was that one custodian, there's multiple custodians in an operate, like a node in the

15:37.720 --> 15:42.480
network and say, oh, I'm storing this physical object here.

15:42.480 --> 15:47.840
And I was trying to think if there's like a fourth version of this was not obvious to

15:47.840 --> 15:53.160
me what it would be, and the issuer of custodian or network of custodians.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.960
Have you seen another model on this?

15:55.960 --> 15:59.200
No, I think that's pretty comprehensive.

15:59.200 --> 16:04.320
When I was going through this framework, like, I was pretty much the same.

16:04.320 --> 16:10.000
And I very much felt like there would be a need very soon of having these centralized

16:10.000 --> 16:15.840
custodians within crypto because to your point, it exists today, right?

16:15.840 --> 16:20.600
I mean, if you were to look up what a free port is, it's a centralized custodian where

16:20.600 --> 16:24.800
exactly to your model that you said with real estate is the same type of transaction that

16:24.800 --> 16:27.880
happens with art already.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.320
Yep.

16:29.320 --> 16:35.520
And then what does the counterparty have to do?

16:35.520 --> 16:41.080
Well, the counterparty has to make sure the claim is executed.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.920
That the authenticity is matchbook on both sides, right?

16:44.920 --> 16:48.680
Like, they've got to manage both sides of authenticity.

16:48.680 --> 16:52.640
That the concert is actually happening, right?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.600
And Taylor Swift will be there.

16:54.600 --> 17:00.600
But also that the claim ticket you've come with is the right one because if they recognize

17:00.600 --> 17:03.960
the wrong one, then two people are going to be fighting for that seat, right?

17:03.960 --> 17:11.680
So that's a managed, the authenticity of the product or service and of the claim ticket.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.760
And then, you know, general quality assurance, which is everything from, you know, it's not

17:15.760 --> 17:19.360
broken and it's there and has a lost your soul order.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.360
Your bed hasn't been made.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.600
I mean, it's an endless topic.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.320
Quality assurance could mean anything.

17:26.320 --> 17:36.240
And basically you're trusting the counterparty to deliver what is what has been bought through

17:36.240 --> 17:37.240
that NFT.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.240
Okay.

17:38.240 --> 17:42.240
Let's go to the next slide.

17:42.240 --> 17:51.640
Now this to me is a very big point because I've had this discussion with many people over

17:51.640 --> 18:00.200
the last two years and they say, okay, this is fine, but why do you need NFTs for this?

18:00.200 --> 18:05.520
You have all types of databases that do this now.

18:05.520 --> 18:15.600
If you go to Expedia or booking.com, you can go and buy a claim on a hotel room in New

18:15.600 --> 18:19.240
York on January 23rd.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.240
And it works fine.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.240
It's just a database.

18:23.240 --> 18:29.240
You don't need all the aggravation of crypto and wallets and gas and Ethereum and all the

18:29.240 --> 18:30.240
stuff.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.240
Right.

18:31.240 --> 18:36.320
And it sounds at first glance like a good question.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.640
And but it's actually not a very good question.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.640
It sounds like a very good question.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.640
It sounds like a whole gosh, right.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.000
We don't need to do this.

18:45.000 --> 18:50.920
And the reason the big opportunity is too full.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.480
How does it work when you go to booking.com?

18:53.480 --> 19:00.680
Well, each each hotel has its own reservation system, right?

19:00.680 --> 19:06.640
And they allocate different groups to different other systems.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.640
Right.

19:07.640 --> 19:12.000
They might say, I'm holding these 10 back because I'm going to do something for my conference

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
or whatever.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Booking.com can book these whatever, 100 groups.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.320
I'm simplifying this.

19:19.320 --> 19:26.360
And then you buy it on primary on primary.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.360
It works.

19:27.360 --> 19:28.360
Okay.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.520
But you still don't see the full order book, right?

19:30.520 --> 19:33.520
You see what you're seeing in a certain marketplace.

19:33.520 --> 19:38.160
It's like content management systems before the Internet.

19:38.160 --> 19:42.960
If you went to someone's content management system, you see the content there, but there

19:42.960 --> 19:47.200
might be content or in this case inventory in a different system.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.400
And you won't see that inventory.

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
Right.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.840
So one, relatively smaller pieces.

19:52.840 --> 20:06.160
Well, if the inventory is just represented as an NFT, the platforms might compete on UX

20:06.160 --> 20:11.440
or UI, but you'll see all of the inventory anywhere.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.240
You could go directly and see all the inventory on a generic platform.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.880
It opens your ether scan or whatever.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.680
You could always go see the inventory.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.240
But that's not the big idea.

20:20.240 --> 20:25.160
The big idea is you develop a secondary market.

20:25.160 --> 20:29.280
And so what do I mean by this?

20:29.280 --> 20:39.560
Let's say it's January 23rd and I need to be New York and it's time sensitive and I haven't

20:39.560 --> 20:42.280
booked my hotel.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.280
Right.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.280
And I don't know.

20:44.280 --> 20:49.640
There's a conference happening and you go and see, oh gosh, it's all sold out or this.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.280
I mean, New York never really sells up.

20:51.280 --> 20:56.200
But the approximate is all sold out or there's only these five options instead of the under

20:56.200 --> 20:57.200
options.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.400
Is that really true at all?

21:01.400 --> 21:09.960
Is it really true that I cannot get a room that I am not the highest possible bidder

21:09.960 --> 21:11.920
for at least one of the other rooms?

21:11.920 --> 21:16.480
You almost recognize it's in fact, not true at all.

21:16.480 --> 21:21.720
In fact, that night in New York, there will be some couple from Massachusetts that booked

21:21.720 --> 21:27.400
the room six months ago and paid 200 bucks for it and they don't have a time sensitive

21:27.400 --> 21:30.000
reason that they want to be in New York.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.040
And if I could find that couple and say, hey, would you like 400 bucks and I'll take your

21:36.040 --> 21:38.160
room at the 23rd and you can come back any other day.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.160
You're not 10 cents.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.160
We're just here on holiday.

21:40.160 --> 21:47.640
You're an elderly couple and would you prefer to come back next week and also put $200 in

21:47.640 --> 21:48.640
your pocket?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.720
And ask me, oh, yes, that sounds very good.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.880
Like they win and I win.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.960
But there's no way to do that now, right?

21:56.960 --> 22:04.520
Because the secondary, the claims once they're issued are fragmented.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.520
They're missing.

22:05.520 --> 22:11.320
There's no easy way to trade a digital good for currency.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.600
Trustlessly, we know how this works, right?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.880
There's all point of crypto.

22:15.880 --> 22:23.280
And so if you imagined instead that every room for every night and every hotel in New

22:23.280 --> 22:29.240
York was represented by an NFT and think about how opens he works today, right?

22:29.240 --> 22:34.320
The interface would be a little bit different, but conceptually, you go there and go on the

22:34.320 --> 22:46.360
page on a New York City and say January 23rd, hotels four and five star, midtown and below.

22:46.360 --> 22:53.240
I'm putting a collection wide bid of $400.

22:53.240 --> 22:57.160
I'm pretty certain in that world, which is always a way, right?

22:57.160 --> 23:04.440
In that world, that bid would hit instantly even on a night that most hotels are supposed

23:04.440 --> 23:07.640
to sold out, right?

23:07.640 --> 23:13.360
And what this means is you can actually create secondary markets and everything.

23:13.360 --> 23:17.760
And here we're going to have an intellectual discussion with somebody who's like, oh, I

23:17.760 --> 23:19.960
don't like markets.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.800
Why does everything have to be markets?

23:21.800 --> 23:27.080
The point is in a capital economy, everything's ready markets.

23:27.080 --> 23:35.320
This just makes the markets more correct, more efficient.

23:35.320 --> 23:41.400
If you help people make a voluntary trade that they couldn't have made previously, you've

23:41.400 --> 23:43.040
increased the utility in the world.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.840
You haven't decreased them.

23:45.840 --> 23:50.560
Now that, and then you can do all types of, I mean, wild things, right?

23:50.560 --> 23:56.920
You will have people arming hotel nights, right?

23:56.920 --> 23:58.760
As well, that sounds bad.

23:58.760 --> 24:05.000
But sometimes the size of hotels, market prices will come into line.

24:05.000 --> 24:13.200
I was thinking about this during COVID when some governments were like paying hotels preemptively

24:13.200 --> 24:16.320
to book some rights in the future to keep them alive.

24:16.320 --> 24:24.080
I'm saying, no, this would make more sense that the hotels could sell those claims cheaply.

24:24.080 --> 24:29.680
And someone else could take on the risk that the lockdown ends and they can sell them more

24:29.680 --> 24:32.000
expensive, right?

24:32.000 --> 24:38.120
The hotels needed some minimal amount of cash at point X to lockdown to not go bankrupt.

24:38.120 --> 24:42.960
And they had these future claims that nobody's booking because nobody knows what the lockdown

24:42.960 --> 24:43.960
is ending.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.120
But some financial industry will take that risk at some price.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.080
There's some prices that I know I don't know what the locals are doing right in.

24:50.080 --> 24:58.440
I'll buy the hotel room now for $30 and hope to resell it for $130.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.840
And that happens to some degree with travel agents.

25:00.840 --> 25:11.880
But again, just like NFTs, what they're doing to the fine art market, right, is democratizing.

25:11.880 --> 25:17.920
If you wanted to buy, if you wanted to buy a key pairing, you basically have to walk into

25:17.920 --> 25:22.120
one of X places in the world, what's the price?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
Visically.

25:23.120 --> 25:31.160
If you want to buy a ringer, you just need an internet connection.

25:31.160 --> 25:37.480
And there's no specific extra advantage you have if you're a fancy institutional investor,

25:37.480 --> 25:45.960
if you're an art expert, if you are just a random person, you have the same first class

25:45.960 --> 25:51.360
access to the distribution rails for fine art.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.560
For everyone in the world instantaneously, it's amazing.

25:54.560 --> 25:55.560
Also true for artists.

25:55.560 --> 25:59.160
I mean, I mean, I'm an obvious institutional artist.

25:59.160 --> 26:01.640
Distribution rails can't fix them, right?

26:01.640 --> 26:08.760
But the fact that you, brand new artists, you can be an 18 year old in India, and you

26:08.760 --> 26:12.520
will have the same distribution rails as Tyler Hobbes says.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.920
Not the same branding, not the same promotion, that's different, right?

26:14.920 --> 26:17.400
Not the same reputation, that's also different.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.000
But before you didn't even have the distribution rails, right, you would have that 18 year

26:21.000 --> 26:27.720
old kid in Andobot couldn't get into the gallery in London or in Soho or in Miami or

26:27.720 --> 26:28.720
Switzerland.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.400
Right, but here they have the same rules.

26:32.400 --> 26:38.920
And this model is now extensible once this happens, once this happens, to everything,

26:38.920 --> 26:41.760
not just art, everything.

26:41.760 --> 26:50.560
Everyone can have the same ability to buy, sell, trade, claims in the physical world,

26:50.560 --> 26:55.360
instantly, globally with an air connection.

26:55.360 --> 27:00.560
Arguably this, someday, will be a bigger deal of a native initial.

27:00.560 --> 27:06.080
Quite a way in the future, I'll come back in a second, but arguably will be bigger because

27:06.080 --> 27:11.960
this can represent everything, including the whole physical based economy, which is the

27:11.960 --> 27:17.120
vast majority of the largest asset class in the space, in the world, by a lot, is real

27:17.120 --> 27:19.120
estate, right?

27:19.120 --> 27:26.000
So actually, in real estate, can come and owner or rented, and I'm just being renting

27:26.000 --> 27:29.360
an apartment, hotels or rental, rental, right?

27:29.360 --> 27:42.520
So once we can make efficient markets, if it sounds weird in the hotel space, think

27:42.520 --> 27:45.680
about it for the real estate space.

27:45.680 --> 27:52.560
Real estate is extremely sticky, a liquid high transaction cost, right?

27:52.560 --> 28:02.720
Imagine if every apartment in Miami, you could put a bid, ask for, et cetera, and like, hey,

28:02.720 --> 28:07.520
I need liquidity, I need to get out of my apartment now, right?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.640
I need to be out now.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.040
You put a low ask, right?

28:11.040 --> 28:14.280
You put a low, by now price.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.720
That will get sniped in a way that it won't happen in the current system, right?

28:19.720 --> 28:27.800
And so, bringing markets, including secondary markets to all the world's physical goods

28:27.800 --> 28:33.520
and services, is another one of these, like, give you huge ideas.

28:33.520 --> 28:42.600
But unlike the native visual here, VTL, let's go to the next slide, there are challenges.

28:42.600 --> 28:52.040
The reason NFTs took off first in native visual, the reason Fedensus took off, is because Fedensus

28:52.040 --> 28:58.760
didn't need permission from anyone to mint the token and put the code in the token.

28:58.760 --> 29:04.280
And that, to take the simple example, is not truly real estate.

29:04.280 --> 29:12.880
A binding sale of real estate has a bunch of semi-now arcade paperwork that needs that.

29:12.880 --> 29:18.880
And if you don't do that paperwork, you haven't actually bought the real estate.

29:18.880 --> 29:27.280
And so, I cannot just spin up an NFT collection, say, hey, the SineFT represents my house.

29:27.280 --> 29:31.680
And if you buy the SineFT, you now own my house, because you could go then go to the

29:31.680 --> 29:35.960
title office and still going to have my name on it.

29:35.960 --> 29:40.040
And for the title office to accept that the new owner has bought it, they're going to

29:40.040 --> 29:42.440
want to see it as it varies by country.

29:42.440 --> 29:46.680
But in many countries, it requires a physical signature, right?

29:46.680 --> 29:48.360
And witnesses and all these things, right?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.480
So, understandably, that house is important.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.640
People don't want to lose their house for bad transaction.

29:53.640 --> 30:03.240
And so, there's in many cases, a regulatory bridge is one of the things that keeps saying,

30:03.240 --> 30:04.240
that needs to come in place.

30:04.240 --> 30:09.200
Well, that coming place tomorrow for real estate is Congress working on allowing us

30:09.200 --> 30:13.080
to trade NFTs representing houses now.

30:13.080 --> 30:21.040
They're currently complaining if they want to shut down crypto or whatever wild ideas

30:21.040 --> 30:22.040
they get, right?

30:22.040 --> 30:23.040
But will this happen?

30:23.040 --> 30:26.560
And yes, it will happen for the same reason that these signatures happen, right?

30:26.560 --> 30:31.040
Eventually, we will be able to represent claims digitally.

30:31.040 --> 30:36.400
They will be legally binding, and that will take care of the first bucket.

30:36.400 --> 30:42.680
The second and third bucket are kind of the same, but, well, I separate them as follows.

30:42.680 --> 30:46.200
And I'm going to ask too many about this.

30:46.200 --> 30:52.880
Like, you know, how do I know the shirt that I own is the same shirt as the NFT, right?

30:52.880 --> 30:55.400
How do you actually make that linkage?

30:55.400 --> 31:01.320
The third is the counterpart of stuff, like how is it actually, how is the physical delivery,

31:01.320 --> 31:03.480
the physical execution happen?

31:03.480 --> 31:08.480
And generally, because of these things, the space is still quite immature.

31:08.480 --> 31:12.240
I don't know what percent of the NFT market represents.

31:12.240 --> 31:15.720
NFT is the physical component, but it's pretty small.

31:15.720 --> 31:18.000
And the NFT market itself is very immature.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.960
The NFT market is maybe a $10 billion market cap.

31:22.960 --> 31:27.160
It's like, I don't know, 1% of crypto and crypto is still a very immature asset class, right?

31:27.160 --> 31:33.680
So this is the immature end of the immature end of a fairly immature asset class.

31:33.680 --> 31:41.880
But this also has the opposite perspective that this is why there's potentially a big

31:41.880 --> 31:42.880
opportunity.

31:42.880 --> 31:49.000
Once things are mature and working and they've spent decades, we in society have spent decades

31:49.000 --> 31:53.680
getting them to work in a boring manner, there's usually less fewer business opportunities

31:53.680 --> 31:56.280
because it's now quite efficient.

31:56.280 --> 32:00.640
So anything you'd say here?

32:00.640 --> 32:03.120
I think that this is pretty spot on.

32:03.120 --> 32:07.440
You know, I've been experiencing a lot of these firsthand, right?

32:07.440 --> 32:13.320
I think when you talk about legal frameworks of, first off, you have governments trying

32:13.320 --> 32:16.200
to wrap their head around NFTs.

32:16.200 --> 32:22.000
And now, as I think, my thesis is that NFTs will be coming into the real world and that

32:22.000 --> 32:24.280
this tech will be coming into the real world.

32:24.280 --> 32:27.840
And you do have to deal with the issues that you have highlighted here, right?

32:27.840 --> 32:33.320
It's like, how do you associate the physical with the digital?

32:33.320 --> 32:35.760
How do you handle shipping, insurance, damages?

32:35.760 --> 32:37.520
How do you prove authenticity?

32:37.520 --> 32:42.560
To me, these are all things that the space will have to deal with heads on, right?

32:42.560 --> 32:47.960
And really deal with archaic laws that already exist, right?

32:47.960 --> 32:52.600
And how you kind of retrofit that and create a framework for going forward, which I think

32:52.600 --> 32:54.160
will be really interesting.

32:54.160 --> 32:58.280
And to your point is where this is where a lot of the opportunity lies, right?

32:58.280 --> 33:04.760
Because once people figure this out and once people understand exactly how these things

33:04.760 --> 33:08.520
will be handled going forward, then a lot of those opportunities will then be gone by

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
them.

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
Agreed.

33:10.520 --> 33:15.880
Let's see the next slide, NFT.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.000
So this is a slide I use a lot.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.760
And it's very conceptual, right?

33:22.760 --> 33:25.880
Like there's not actual dates in there.

33:25.880 --> 33:30.280
All the things on the left are the things that could be done natively digital or intangible

33:30.280 --> 33:31.280
assets.

33:31.280 --> 33:37.920
And intangible assets are big categories, post to $80 trillion category.

33:37.920 --> 33:42.240
And all types of things can be in there and those can happen, I think, faster because

33:42.240 --> 33:46.200
you don't have to solve these bridges in the physical world.

33:46.200 --> 33:51.080
And then abstracted physical or tangible assets, which are services and goods.

33:51.080 --> 33:53.440
I think services like come even faster than goods.

33:53.440 --> 33:58.240
It's going to be less of a regulatory hurdle to sell a tailor-subtricate ticket than sell

33:58.240 --> 34:00.360
your house, right?

34:00.360 --> 34:06.160
And then ultimately, ultimately, the ultimate claim is governance in the physical world.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.960
I think that will come too.

34:07.960 --> 34:12.840
Now, I think we will see more of the ladder of the physical stuff in the second half

34:12.840 --> 34:18.040
of the decade and digital as obviously started now and will continue.

34:18.040 --> 34:21.000
It doesn't mean we have to wait until 2025.

34:21.000 --> 34:24.400
This is, we have people like Jim and he doing it today.

34:24.400 --> 34:31.800
But because of these specific topics that need to be solved, it will take longer to ramp

34:31.800 --> 34:32.800
up.

34:32.800 --> 34:38.400
So, I think these are my general topics.

34:38.400 --> 34:45.400
Let's go to 9DCC, which I think is a couple of slides forward.

34:45.400 --> 34:51.360
And before we get into any sophisticated thoughts, tell us what it is.

34:51.360 --> 34:59.400
Yeah, so at a really high level, 9DCC is a crypto-native luxury lifestyle brand.

34:59.400 --> 35:05.320
And the reason why I felt like that there was a need for it is when I was going around

35:05.320 --> 35:10.880
to conferences and I was going around and meeting people in real life, I quickly realized

35:10.880 --> 35:18.120
that the same way that I can signal that I'm a crypto-native with my crypto-punk, and

35:18.120 --> 35:24.720
that was my thesis for buying my ape when I did was this is a flex, this is a signal

35:24.720 --> 35:28.400
that I am sending to my peers in a digital world.

35:28.400 --> 35:34.320
Nothing like that existed to the way that I wanted it, in terms of an aesthetic that

35:34.320 --> 35:39.440
I wanted to wear, that I could signal to the real world that I'm a crypto-native and having

35:39.440 --> 35:45.840
the quality of product that I wanted to wear in terms of production.

35:45.840 --> 35:50.720
You know, just generally like things that I would wear, it just didn't exist.

35:50.720 --> 35:56.080
And so rather than wait for somebody else to go out and build it, I decided to do it

35:56.080 --> 35:58.840
on my own.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.800
So let me put it back in my words.

36:01.800 --> 36:08.840
Obviously there's all types of quote unquote flexes in the physical world in terms of existing

36:08.840 --> 36:16.800
physical products, but you from an aesthetic or messaging perspective, they're not crypto-native,

36:16.800 --> 36:17.800
right?

36:17.800 --> 36:21.320
Like there's existing luxury brands are not crypto-native.

36:21.320 --> 36:25.800
So yeah, so I felt like that there was this kind of like if you had like these two subsets,

36:25.800 --> 36:26.800
right?

36:26.800 --> 36:32.240
It's like, you know, you could, I could walk into a Dior store and I could buy a shirt

36:32.240 --> 36:34.360
off the rack and I could wear that out.

36:34.360 --> 36:37.760
And that would obviously be of the quality that I wanted.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.560
But that wouldn't signal that I was a crypto native.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.120
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, I feel like there was a lot of product from

36:44.120 --> 36:48.320
the crypto world that, okay, I can signal that I'm a crypto native with it, but it wasn't

36:48.320 --> 36:53.240
necessarily the quality or the community that I would necessarily want to be a part of.

36:53.240 --> 36:58.080
And so I feel like there will be this growing intersection of the overlap of those two communities

36:58.080 --> 36:59.080
over time.

36:59.080 --> 37:09.200
I'm going to take a step back here because you very famously were one of the first people,

37:09.200 --> 37:16.680
maybe the first person to pay an awful lot of money for a crypto book for your ape.

37:16.680 --> 37:24.920
And I think that kind of snowballed the big rally in crypto punks.

37:24.920 --> 37:29.480
Tell us a little bit about the logic because you said it was like that logic.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.200
So let's tell the group that logic.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.400
How do this all start?

37:33.400 --> 37:34.400
Yeah.

37:34.400 --> 37:43.440
So, you know, I, when I found NFTs, it was August of 2020, and they like almost immediately

37:43.440 --> 37:47.520
made sense to me because I started playing Fortnite at the beginning of quarantine.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.960
And that was back in March of 2020.

37:49.960 --> 37:54.240
And when I was playing with all these kids, you know, teenagers, the first thing that they

37:54.240 --> 37:57.240
would ask me is, you know, what skins did you buy?

37:57.240 --> 38:00.040
And skins that they don't give you any special powers.

38:00.040 --> 38:03.400
The only thing they do is change how you look while you play that game.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.400
And these kids would be changing their skins every, you know, 10 to 20 minutes, depending

38:07.400 --> 38:09.240
on how long the game was.

38:09.240 --> 38:13.760
And I was, I said to myself, like, there's this massive super cycle here where that kid

38:13.760 --> 38:18.680
is 12 years old today, 10 years from now, he'll be 22 and he'll have his own disposable

38:18.680 --> 38:22.720
income and he'll be totally okay with owning a purely digital asset.

38:22.720 --> 38:29.320
Now at the time, I had no idea what NFTs were, but it was an idea that stuck with me.

38:29.320 --> 38:34.600
And when I found NFTs, I was like, wow, this is your skin on Twitter, right?

38:34.600 --> 38:40.520
Like this is literally, you know, the same way that if I got a limited edition skin that

38:40.520 --> 38:44.720
now trades on eBay at a premium, this type of thing would happen.

38:44.720 --> 38:50.360
And to your point is, there is a secondary marketplace that exists for, you know, the

38:50.360 --> 38:53.880
value of this thing to be found on in a free market.

38:53.880 --> 38:58.400
And so I started delving down the crypto rabbit hole, the NFT rabbit hole, because I was already

38:58.400 --> 39:00.080
in crypto.

39:00.080 --> 39:07.800
And I saw crypto punks and I think the floor was maybe around $1,000 at the time, but

39:07.800 --> 39:09.160
I said, oh, these are too expensive.

39:09.160 --> 39:11.800
I want to find the next crypto punks.

39:11.800 --> 39:17.960
And I ended up minting a bunch of chromisquiggles and, you know, snow fro and a few other OGs

39:17.960 --> 39:20.320
where, you know, they told me, what are you doing?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.280
Like, you know, you should be buying a crypto punk.

39:22.280 --> 39:27.480
You should buy a zombie or what, you know, or something like a big, a rare one, a super

39:27.480 --> 39:28.480
rare one.

39:28.480 --> 39:31.960
And, you know, I started spending some time really researching it.

39:31.960 --> 39:38.720
And that's kind of where I developed my thesis, which is my, my pin tweet in my Twitter,

39:38.720 --> 39:43.360
where, you know, humans are, you know, social creatures, right?

39:43.360 --> 39:48.680
And even though the technology of how we interact with each other will change, but the one

39:48.680 --> 39:54.160
thing that doesn't change is, you know, the way we signal to each other, the way we interact

39:54.160 --> 39:55.160
with each other.

39:55.160 --> 40:01.440
And like a really simple example that I always use is, you know, if we were to meet for dinner

40:01.440 --> 40:07.760
6529 and we were to sit down and I were to show you my bank account, like that, like,

40:07.760 --> 40:09.560
that would be weird, right?

40:09.560 --> 40:12.760
That's just not how humans like interact with each other.

40:12.760 --> 40:18.880
But I could almost send a very similar signal by wearing a nice watch, by driving a nice

40:18.880 --> 40:23.600
car, by wearing nice clothes that, oh, you know, you don't know exactly how much is my

40:23.600 --> 40:24.840
bank account.

40:24.840 --> 40:29.920
But judging by the nature of the things that I am wearing or consuming, you can have a

40:29.920 --> 40:35.840
good idea of like, oh, if this person is doing X, then, you know, it probably signals Y.

40:35.840 --> 40:39.400
And that's just the way humans operate because that's, you know, that and that's been since

40:39.400 --> 40:40.400
the dawn of time.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.040
And it's not just humans, right?

40:42.040 --> 40:48.040
It is other animals that do certain things or have certain behavior patterns.

40:48.040 --> 40:52.640
That is, let's say, for mating or for social hierarchy within their groups.

40:52.640 --> 40:58.960
And so my thesis very quickly became that, okay, the same way that me wearing a Rolex

40:58.960 --> 41:04.400
to a nice dinner allows me to send a signal in that smaller group.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.320
Me spending a certain amount of money that's verifiable on chain for a picture also sends

41:10.320 --> 41:15.280
that signal of one, you know, what part of the community am I a part of?

41:15.280 --> 41:21.200
But then two is also it's a verifiable signal that has a ton of scale, right?

41:21.200 --> 41:26.880
So when I drive a Lamborghini through my neighborhood, then maybe only like 10 to 50 people see

41:26.880 --> 41:28.160
it that day.

41:28.160 --> 41:32.760
But if I buy something that's worth the same amount as that Lamborghini and I make it my

41:32.760 --> 41:38.040
profile picture, then that scales to thousands, if not millions of people with the same, with

41:38.040 --> 41:39.480
the same exact outlay.

41:39.480 --> 41:44.760
And so that was like my original thesis for CryptoPunks and the ape.

41:44.760 --> 41:50.120
And you know, it just, it was, to me, it's like it's signaled after spending, you know,

41:50.120 --> 41:54.360
some time in the space in the NFT space, it's signaled what I thought would be maybe the

41:54.360 --> 41:59.080
most crypto native OG community in the NFT space.

41:59.080 --> 42:03.200
And so for that reason, people would want to be associated over time and it would hold

42:03.200 --> 42:08.920
that provenance and it would hold that upper echelon within the community, even, you know,

42:08.920 --> 42:11.920
through in into bear markets and bull markets.

42:11.920 --> 42:12.920
Got it.

42:12.920 --> 42:19.440
And then I think a big part of that turned out to be turned out to be right.

42:19.440 --> 42:28.520
And then you're now saying, okay, when I'm interacting with my crypto community in real

42:28.520 --> 42:32.840
life, how to represent these same things.

42:32.840 --> 42:38.360
And that's a lot of, let me ask you, you're saying, is this somehow different?

42:38.360 --> 42:42.560
And how is it different that you say, well, look, I'm making nice clothes.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.080
What's different about that?

42:45.080 --> 42:46.920
I think that there are a few things.

42:46.920 --> 42:51.280
I think one is I'm integrating the technology into it, right?

42:51.280 --> 42:53.720
But also it's like, you know, what does it stand for?

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
Right?

42:54.720 --> 43:00.500
Because like I said, there is no, like I could wear a board eight on my shirt, but that's

43:00.500 --> 43:03.680
just generally not an aesthetic that I would want to wear.

43:03.680 --> 43:08.680
And I think like for me, like the aesthetic that I created with 90 CC is something that

43:08.680 --> 43:10.160
I would be interested in wearing.

43:10.160 --> 43:12.200
I hope others would be interested in wearing.

43:12.200 --> 43:17.120
I think it's a level of quality of, you know, I've been to a lot of crypto conferences.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.800
I mean, people spend a lot of money on clothes.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.680
People spend a lot of money on how they look.

43:21.680 --> 43:26.160
And so, but the problem is is that there's no way to signal that you're a crypto native.

43:26.160 --> 43:29.680
So I think that that was, that was the first pillar that I wanted to solve.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.360
But then like where I think things get really interesting is, you know, kind of what's mentioned

43:33.360 --> 43:37.920
on this slide here is where, you know, you can have a certificate of authenticity that

43:37.920 --> 43:40.000
travels with the physical product, right?

43:40.000 --> 43:44.360
And when you look at watches, right, I think watches are a great example where if you buy

43:44.360 --> 43:49.760
a watch with paperwork, it's worth significantly more than a watch without paperwork, right?

43:49.760 --> 43:55.840
So, you know, there, there is a good, a good proof case that there is a significant amount

43:55.840 --> 43:59.600
of value placed on that certificate of authenticity.

43:59.600 --> 44:04.240
And the more interlinked that you can make that certificate of authenticity with the

44:04.240 --> 44:09.600
actual product, then the less risk there is of that thing being a fake, right?

44:09.600 --> 44:15.800
You know, secondhand goods, secondhand luxury goods is a massive business and it's growing.

44:15.800 --> 44:20.600
Like fake goods that are made is a massive business and it's still growing.

44:20.600 --> 44:24.720
And so all of these things that there's, there is a lot of need for this, but there isn't

44:24.720 --> 44:28.400
necessarily a solution out there that works at scale.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.520
Because when you want to make, if you were to buy a product secondhand, you need to take

44:32.520 --> 44:37.320
it to an expert that could still doesn't guarantee that it's actually real, right?

44:37.320 --> 44:42.660
Because every, each and every day, fakes are getting better and better in terms of quality.

44:42.660 --> 44:46.960
So that somebody that might have caught a fake, you know, three to five years ago might not

44:46.960 --> 44:48.800
be able to catch that fake today.

44:48.800 --> 44:53.840
So what better way than to have a certificate of authenticity that is provable on a decentralized

44:53.840 --> 44:58.800
ledger by just scanning the shirt instead of, let's say, having to increase that cost

44:58.800 --> 45:03.240
of transaction by having to go to an expert to verify that it's real.

45:03.240 --> 45:08.160
And even then that verification doesn't necessarily guarantee that it's real.

45:08.160 --> 45:11.640
So you said there's the tech.

45:11.640 --> 45:13.560
How does that work?

45:13.560 --> 45:15.160
So it's really simple.

45:15.160 --> 45:21.560
So on all of our iteration one and iteration two shirts, you can see in the patch where

45:21.560 --> 45:26.800
the nine is on both those shirts and those pictures, there's an NFC chip behind that

45:26.800 --> 45:29.960
patch, which you can then scan.

45:29.960 --> 45:36.400
And it takes you to a page that shows you the NFT that represents that shirt on the blockchain.

45:36.400 --> 45:40.760
And that it is held in that owner's wallet.

45:40.760 --> 45:43.800
So there's a little chip embedded in the shirt.

45:43.800 --> 45:44.800
Yeah.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.800
What?

45:45.800 --> 45:46.800
Yes.

45:46.800 --> 45:49.800
And you can longer it with a wash it.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.800
Yeah.

45:51.800 --> 46:03.240
And this and the NFT, if I go now and just buy one of these NFTs online.

46:03.240 --> 46:04.960
So where's the shirt?

46:04.960 --> 46:06.080
How do I get it?

46:06.080 --> 46:11.640
So the way we did the drop mechanic was we partnered with 4K, which is a centralized

46:11.640 --> 46:18.240
custodian, to your point that you were saying earlier, right, is what I found that, you know,

46:18.240 --> 46:22.200
when you take a look at, you know, sneaker culture and you take a look at the resale

46:22.200 --> 46:26.760
market, a lot of people will buy more than one product, right?

46:26.760 --> 46:32.960
So you'll buy like people always say, one to one to cop and one to one to rock and one

46:32.960 --> 46:34.040
to cop.

46:34.040 --> 46:39.960
And so what ends up happening is people will store a pair of sneakers in their closet

46:39.960 --> 46:41.560
and they will never wear them.

46:41.560 --> 46:45.880
And that stays stored in their closet until they dig the day they go to sell it.

46:45.880 --> 46:50.520
And so my thought process is if I'm only going to be storing it in my closet and the

46:50.520 --> 46:54.040
only time I'm going to touch it is when I actually go to sell it, there's technically

46:54.040 --> 46:56.000
no reason for me to take delivery.

46:56.000 --> 47:00.160
Much the same way that stocks work, right, is like you don't physically take delivery

47:00.160 --> 47:02.200
of the shares when you buy and sell it.

47:02.200 --> 47:08.400
You have a claim on those shares that is managed by a central database that will tell you that

47:08.400 --> 47:13.680
runs their own ledger that tells you you buy or you own or you buy or sell an asset.

47:13.680 --> 47:18.560
And so what we did is we partnered with 4K, so when we made all of the shirts, we delivered

47:18.560 --> 47:26.720
them to 4K and 4K then issued an NFT voucher which represents that T-shirt in their warehouse.

47:26.720 --> 47:30.280
And we can go around and you can trade that a thousand times.

47:30.280 --> 47:35.240
And then at any given point in time, whoever owns that voucher can then go to 4K and claim

47:35.240 --> 47:40.520
that shirt and get it delivered to them anywhere in the world within three to five days, which

47:40.520 --> 47:50.160
I think is an insanely amazing feat considering where we are with the resale of goods today

47:50.160 --> 47:56.400
where it happens on eBay, it happens on StockX, the cost of transactions is way higher because

47:56.400 --> 48:02.120
you have to verify things that might be in the condition that might not be in the condition

48:02.120 --> 48:07.400
that they're supposed to be in, but then also the length of time that it takes to verify

48:07.400 --> 48:14.480
that something is real, to get it sent from the seller, to the authenticator, to the buyer,

48:14.480 --> 48:16.240
just like there's a lot of friction there.

48:16.240 --> 48:21.420
And I feel like by placing these assets in a centralized custodian that to your point

48:21.420 --> 48:26.840
is can verify the condition that they're in and can verify delivery and that there's

48:26.840 --> 48:33.360
actually an actual physical product there, you then make the friction much lower, right?

48:33.360 --> 48:40.240
And you increase this ability for people to conduct commerce on a much global scale.

48:40.240 --> 48:50.640
And does 4K charge the, let's say I buy the NFT, now I have a claim on a shirt at 4K,

48:50.640 --> 48:53.080
do I have to pay annual storage?

48:53.080 --> 48:54.160
How does it work?

48:54.160 --> 49:00.080
So the way we work the first shop, the first shop has free lifetime storage, the second

49:00.080 --> 49:05.640
shop has free storage for two years, free storage and insurance for two years.

49:05.640 --> 49:10.880
And then afterwards, I believe the fee might be like around $2 a year, per sure.

49:10.880 --> 49:17.440
I don't know the exact thoughts off my head, but it very much would work in terms of like

49:17.440 --> 49:23.640
if anybody sees, and this is like long term, but if anybody has seen storage wars where

49:23.640 --> 49:28.720
somebody were to default on like their storage fees at some point, then they obviously forfeit

49:28.720 --> 49:33.520
the asset that's held in the warehouse and then it would go to auction.

49:33.520 --> 49:34.520
Right.

49:34.520 --> 49:43.080
And then if, so I can trade and then the person who buys it knows the shirt bagging it, if

49:43.080 --> 49:50.640
I redeem the shirt, does my NFT change from like a mid pass NFT to a kind of ownership

49:50.640 --> 49:51.640
NFT?

49:51.640 --> 49:52.640
Yeah.

49:52.640 --> 49:57.760
So what ends up happening is when you claim the shirt, you burn your NFT, which is basically

49:57.760 --> 50:00.720
a bearer instrument for that shirt in their warehouse.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.400
They ship you the shirt.

50:02.400 --> 50:07.560
When you get this fit, when you get the physical shirt, you unpack it, you then scan the tag

50:07.560 --> 50:14.120
and then you can pull the NFT into your wallet, which acts as the certificate of authenticity.

50:14.120 --> 50:20.280
So like for me, like one of the things that I had a really tough time wrapping my head

50:20.280 --> 50:24.920
around and you know, when I when I met the team in IYK, it made the most sense to me

50:24.920 --> 50:30.040
where up until that point, all the solutions that I had seen linking the physical product

50:30.040 --> 50:35.840
to the digital NFT didn't scale because it works great on the primary sale, right?

50:35.840 --> 50:39.920
It works great if you are the first person to buy the product for me.

50:39.920 --> 50:42.880
I ship you the shirt and I ship you the NFT.

50:42.880 --> 50:46.680
But now what happens if you want to turn around and you want to sell it to somebody else,

50:46.680 --> 50:47.760
right?

50:47.760 --> 50:52.200
It doesn't scale because if you were to if you were to give them that shirt and somebody

50:52.200 --> 50:56.920
were to give you cash, then you need to go home and send them that NFT.

50:56.920 --> 51:01.520
Now as soon as you have that cash, you are no longer incentivized to send them that NFT.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.440
You'll get to it when you get to it.

51:03.440 --> 51:07.000
But by by by and that's a push mechanism, right?

51:07.000 --> 51:12.200
By using the pull mechanism, which IYK, you know, originally were the first people that

51:12.200 --> 51:13.440
spoke to me about it.

51:13.440 --> 51:17.360
I thought it was genius in the sense that whoever has physical possession of the shirt

51:17.360 --> 51:23.480
can then pull that NFT, that certificate of authenticity into their wallet.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.760
So you know, when they say possession is nine tenths of the law, you know, that that rings

51:27.760 --> 51:32.600
really true in the sense that yes, you have that physical certificate of authenticity

51:32.600 --> 51:38.480
that travels with the actual shirts so that in that interaction that I just told you about,

51:38.480 --> 51:42.080
then as soon as you get your money, then the transaction is over.

51:42.080 --> 51:47.880
That person can then pull that certificate of authenticity into their wallet whenever they

51:47.880 --> 51:48.880
want.

51:48.880 --> 51:54.560
So basically it's a custom contract that IYK runs.

51:54.560 --> 52:01.440
And if you scan the physical, whoever has access to the physical good can pull the virtual

52:01.440 --> 52:02.440
day.

52:02.440 --> 52:03.440
Yes.

52:03.440 --> 52:06.960
It's really interesting.

52:06.960 --> 52:13.360
And like the thing that I really liked about it was that it was just nobody else had really

52:13.360 --> 52:14.840
come up with that solution at the time.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.440
This was, you know, over a year ago at this point.

52:17.440 --> 52:21.120
And I was like, wow, that to me is something that's super scalable, right?

52:21.120 --> 52:26.440
That because again, going back to the watch example where, you know, you have, you can

52:26.440 --> 52:32.800
make an argument that the paperwork that certificate of authenticity is equally as valuable if

52:32.800 --> 52:37.520
not maybe more valuable than the actual watch itself, right?

52:37.520 --> 52:39.800
Because that's the proof that this is real.

52:39.800 --> 52:40.800
Right.

52:40.800 --> 52:54.520
And even though, and people can't, can they copy that?

52:54.520 --> 52:55.520
The NFT?

52:55.520 --> 52:58.640
The code is scanned.

52:58.640 --> 53:02.680
No, because the code is like it's locked into the chip.

53:02.680 --> 53:09.880
So, you know, if you like, if you wanted to, let's say, make a fake, right?

53:09.880 --> 53:14.880
It ultimately wouldn't have, you know, you wouldn't be able to claim the actual NFT fraud

53:14.880 --> 53:17.880
that originally comes from the 90 CC wallet.

53:17.880 --> 53:21.600
You know, when you talk about provenance and we obviously talk about this with artists all

53:21.600 --> 53:22.600
the time.

53:22.600 --> 53:27.560
And the reason why I named the brand 90 CC is that is the wallet that is the proof, the

53:27.560 --> 53:28.920
provenance, right?

53:28.920 --> 53:30.760
All our NFTs come from there.

53:30.760 --> 53:32.080
Come from that wallet.

53:32.080 --> 53:36.320
So then you can chain, you can, you can track that chain of history, right?

53:36.320 --> 53:40.480
Where it's like, it will come if you bought a shirt, you bought it from 90 CC.

53:40.480 --> 53:45.640
It goes from 90 CC's wallet to 6529's wallet to whoever other wallet who buys it there

53:45.640 --> 53:46.880
after you.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.840
And that to me becomes super important, right?

53:48.840 --> 53:53.240
So it's like, if somebody were to make a fake, they could, they can make a fake of everything,

53:53.240 --> 53:57.640
except for the actual NFT that can then be pulled into the wallet.

53:57.640 --> 54:01.960
So when you talk about, you know, verifying authenticity, all of a sudden, instead of

54:01.960 --> 54:06.760
having to go to an authenticator to make something as real, it literally just comes down to

54:06.760 --> 54:09.200
something as simple as a scam.

54:09.200 --> 54:11.400
Very interesting.

54:11.400 --> 54:12.400
Okay.

54:12.400 --> 54:17.760
So what, what have been the challenges?

54:17.760 --> 54:22.920
I'll say the challenges have been like dealing with the meat space, right?

54:22.920 --> 54:28.360
dealing with all the things that that you were talking about in terms of, you know, regulation,

54:28.360 --> 54:35.120
shipping, taxes, all these things that there isn't enough regulatory clarity around things

54:35.120 --> 54:36.280
yet.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.480
And we're trying to navigate things the best that we can.

54:39.480 --> 54:44.760
While also like, you know, trying to operate at the forefront of technology of, you know,

54:44.760 --> 54:50.480
a lot of this comes from these are things that I just want to see in the world as a consumer,

54:50.480 --> 54:51.480
right?

54:51.480 --> 54:56.840
If I'm spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on something that's expensive,

54:56.840 --> 55:01.800
I would like to know like, verifiably, how many of them exist, right?

55:01.800 --> 55:06.400
Like, I think this, this always happens, I think with a lot of the luxury goods markets

55:06.400 --> 55:10.040
is where people like, you know, you'll ask is like, how many of these exist?

55:10.040 --> 55:13.320
And they give you a number, but like, you can't necessarily verify that.

55:13.320 --> 55:17.080
Like, they could be over producing or under producing.

55:17.080 --> 55:23.240
And, you know, really relying on the customer's trust, but it's like, why shouldn't it exist

55:23.240 --> 55:27.920
in a way so that people understand exactly how many of them exist in the real world?

55:27.920 --> 55:30.600
Because that also affects long-term value as well, right?

55:30.600 --> 55:35.560
Of like, you know, like t-shirts are going to be naturally deflationary, right?

55:35.560 --> 55:38.680
In terms of, you know, there's wear and tear over time.

55:38.680 --> 55:40.560
There's as soon as you wear one, right?

55:40.560 --> 55:44.640
It's worth, it's worth a different amount than a brand new, never worn shirt.

55:44.640 --> 55:48.600
So I think that will affect, it's going to be really interesting to watch this play out

55:48.600 --> 55:49.720
long-term.

55:49.720 --> 55:55.360
But I'll say like a lot of the, a lot of the stuff has been in terms of delivering quickly,

55:55.360 --> 55:56.360
right?

55:56.360 --> 56:00.120
Having an idea where, you know, in a digital space, I can have an idea and I can execute

56:00.120 --> 56:04.680
it relatively quickly because there's no physical manufacturing component.

56:04.680 --> 56:09.160
But I think when you start getting into the manufacturing of things and the physicality

56:09.160 --> 56:12.920
of things, things start to get much more complicated, right?

56:12.920 --> 56:18.720
And so I'll use like our second drop, which was iteration two, which we did with Snowfro.

56:18.720 --> 56:21.080
It was the collaboration with Snowfro.

56:21.080 --> 56:22.800
It was in our Basel.

56:22.800 --> 56:29.120
And what we did was we made generative clothes on demand for, you know, five days at a pop-up.

56:29.120 --> 56:32.920
So people would come in, they didn't need to have crypto, they can come in, they could

56:32.920 --> 56:34.400
swipe a credit card.

56:34.400 --> 56:38.600
They would mint an NFT, which was a squiggle variant.

56:38.600 --> 56:44.520
So it was the same exact algorithm that Snowfro used to generate the chromiswiggle.

56:44.520 --> 56:48.680
But instead of a squiggly line output, it's a straight line output with the 90cc logo

56:48.680 --> 56:49.760
above.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.640
As soon as that got minted onto the blockchain, we then printed that onto a T-shirt.

56:54.640 --> 57:00.120
We then linked that NFT that the person just minted to the physical shirt so that it travels

57:00.120 --> 57:01.360
with the shirt.

57:01.360 --> 57:04.840
And then we boxed it up and handed it to the customer within 10 minutes.

57:04.840 --> 57:10.520
And so to me, the technical feed of that was amazing.

57:10.520 --> 57:16.240
The fact that we were able to pull that off, there was about 41 hours over the course of

57:16.240 --> 57:20.600
five days that we were up and we were only down for 12 minutes.

57:20.600 --> 57:27.080
And so the fact that we were able to do that, there's a lot of operational intricacies that

57:27.080 --> 57:28.280
end up going into that.

57:28.280 --> 57:34.800
But I think when I look into the future of the same way that we all want very personal

57:34.800 --> 57:40.400
lines, digital products to represent who we are, I think we, as the manufacturing process

57:40.400 --> 57:45.920
is catch up to the human imagination, we're going to start seeing a need and a desire

57:45.920 --> 57:52.480
for personalization, mass personalization within the physical space as well.

57:52.480 --> 57:58.920
So Snowfro was on the course earlier in the fall.

57:58.920 --> 58:01.600
And that's one of his big ideas also, right?

58:01.600 --> 58:08.000
We will see mass personalization, mass customization in physical goods as well.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.920
And it's one of the things he hopes to be working on with Artbox.

58:12.920 --> 58:24.240
So logically, all kind of luxury brands at least are going to want to do something like

58:24.240 --> 58:25.240
what you're doing, right?

58:25.240 --> 58:32.320
And it improves their ability to say, this is the real one and someone else goes and

58:32.320 --> 58:34.520
buys it on Canal Street.

58:34.520 --> 58:37.000
It's not quite the same thing, right?

58:37.000 --> 58:38.000
Exactly.

58:38.000 --> 58:44.640
And I think one, you know, that from low hanging fruit is that certificate of authenticity.

58:44.640 --> 58:50.520
But then also to the point you just made is, you know, mass customization of, you know,

58:50.520 --> 58:55.160
how cool would it be if, you know, you walk into a Louis Vuitton store.

58:55.160 --> 59:00.000
You pick out your favorite purse and you get that personalized more so than just maybe

59:00.000 --> 59:02.160
having like your initials monogrammed on it, right?

59:02.160 --> 59:07.120
You can have like your favorite prints or your favorite artist or, you know, whatever

59:07.120 --> 59:09.640
have you kind of be printed onto it.

59:09.640 --> 59:13.120
And so you get that element of personalization.

59:13.120 --> 59:14.640
And I think that that's where the world is headed.

59:14.640 --> 59:19.920
I think just at this moment, again, we're just held back by the manufacturing process

59:19.920 --> 59:24.600
of how you can do something like this at scale because over the last, you know, hundreds

59:24.600 --> 59:29.720
of 150 years, you know, it's been the exact opposite where it's like, how do you get the

59:29.720 --> 59:34.240
lowest price product of making, you know, a hundred million of the same things for the

59:34.240 --> 59:35.240
lowest cost?

59:35.240 --> 59:39.320
Now, I think we're going to be running into the problem of trying to figure out how do

59:39.320 --> 59:44.520
you make a hundred million unique individual things for the lowest cost?

59:44.520 --> 59:55.680
And is there a way, and I'm not saying today, but somehow that the authenticity would be

59:55.680 --> 01:00:00.720
visible in the physical world, obviously not going to go around scanning people's, I mean,

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.120
be weird if I came and grabbed your tag and like, I had to scan your edit of seat ship,

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.120
right?

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:10.600
But like, is there a way where that does sort of happen in like AR or something?

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.200
I mean, I could see that possibly happening with AR, right?

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:20.840
So in a world where we're all wearing like Google or Apple glasses, or AR glasses, where

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:25.840
you know, it could say, you know, like verified real almost like, think of it maybe like a

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.800
verified collection on OpenSea, right?

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:34.000
And I don't know like the exact capabilities of what that tech would look like, but I could

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.240
definitely see a world where that ends up happening.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:43.760
And you know, like, I think it will lower the amount of fakes out there, right?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:48.600
Because there's that like social and public shame of people, if people find out that,

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.680
you know, you have a fake Rolex or whatever it is, I think it's going to be interesting

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.160
to watch the dynamic play out in real time.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.480
But I do, I do foresee a world where that can happen.

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:09.560
I mean, if there was some world where it's the same world where if you are demonstrating

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:12.200
what's in your wallet, right?

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:19.560
If you can, the same world where you can show that you own your punk in the physical world

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:24.480
is the same world you can do this because all you need to do is show the NFT, right?

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:27.280
We don't need to touch, we don't need to touch your shirt.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:31.760
That could be kind of awkward, right?

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.200
If you have the NFT, then you have the NFT for this in the same way that if you have

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.560
a punk, you can show a punk.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:44.680
So if you have some type of augmented reality glasses, which are going to happen, right?

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:57.280
And if people are somehow signing with their device, I guess their wallet, right?

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:03.480
Their public addresses are wallet, then maybe you could do it that way, right?

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.920
You could imagine happening about that.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.360
Yeah, I mean, I could definitely see that where you can showcase the collection that

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.000
you want people to see, right?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.600
So if you go to a nightclub, maybe you probably showcase a different collection than if you

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:22.200
were to go to get coffee at Starbucks, right?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.280
Yeah, really interesting.

01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:34.680
I mean, I can see how this could be appealing to obviously crypto native fashion companies

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:40.400
like yours, but lifestyle or whatever the right word is, but how it could be interesting

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.200
on the traditional providers who have a large problem with counterfeit, right?

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:53.280
Yeah, I believe it was, I think, $80 billion last year and expected to grow.

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.840
I think maybe double digits to share.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:03.680
What else are you seeing out there that you think is super interesting, challenging?

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:10.760
What's the future of 9DCC?

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.120
Where do we go next?

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:16.880
You know, I think to me, the most compelling part of everything that we've done over the

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.080
last six to seven months has been the gamification of IRL.

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:29.200
And you don't want people coming up to you and randomly scanning your tag, but I think

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.600
what we saw in our Basel was that people do enjoy that and people do like to connect,

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.600
right?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:42.440
Because, and I noticed this really early on after the lockdowns ended, is that we were

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:47.760
making all these connections online, but people want to connect in real life.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:53.120
And I can make an argument that probably the biggest utility of NFTs is connecting in real

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:56.400
life as people make these friends in Discord.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.840
And then when they go to a conference, they want to meet up in real life and have a meet

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.720
up for their communities.

01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:09.320
And so, and this was really born from the idea that I ran a POOP event in June of 2021,

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:15.080
where I tweeted out, you know, show up to this place, and this is during BTC Miami.

01:04:15.080 --> 01:04:20.000
And I tweeted out, show up to this place and, you know, collect the POOP, the person wearing

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.520
the G Money shirt.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.760
And about 80 people showed up over the course of three days.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:29.200
One of those days, there were two guys that met up that didn't have anything in common

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.920
other than the fact that they both followed me and they both showed up to the same coffee

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.080
shop at the same time to collect the POOP.

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:43.320
They ended up starting a venture fund together and they ended up co-founding a few dows together.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.680
And I think about that a lot because these are two people that otherwise would not have

01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:52.320
met if it wasn't for me sending out that tweet.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.960
And as I think about, how can I then increase these interactions to happen at scale so that

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.280
I don't need to be that center spoke for people to connect.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.920
But I can rather create this network where each individual person in that network could

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:10.080
basically become their own node and create their network around them, which will grow

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.760
the entire network.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:18.120
So what we ended up doing and for anybody that ever sees a 90cc shirt out in the wild,

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.640
you can go up to that shirt and you can collect the POOP because each shirt distributes its

01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.040
own individual POOP.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.080
So it is proof that you met that physical shirt.

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:37.360
And what we did with our Basel is we ran two contests concurrently where there was a leaderboard

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.640
for the people, for the person that would collect the most POOPs from unique individual

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.640
shirts.

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:46.200
And there was also another leaderboard for the person that distributed the most POOPs.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.600
And this was run over the course of five days.

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.200
We distributed close to 5,000 POOPs over the course of five days.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.880
And this was all people running around Miami making connections.

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:03.160
I had a lot of people reach out to me saying how it was an amazing icebreaker, right?

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:08.440
Because a lot of times, even if you see somebody wearing a shirt that you like, a lot of times

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:12.320
the conversation is, hey, I like your shirt, thanks.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.280
And the conversation ends there.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:18.000
But I think as humans, we crave that connection, right?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.760
We want to connect with people.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:27.200
And so what collecting a POOP allows is a lot, it allows that icebreaker to happen in a very

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.200
authentic way, right?

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.760
Where it's like, oh, hey, like, you know, you see somebody wearing the shirt, you collect

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:37.120
their POOP, maybe, you know, it takes, you know, five to 15 seconds to actually go through

01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.280
the process.

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:41.520
And in that time, you start talking to the person and it's like, oh, where are you from?

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520
What do you do?

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520
What are you into?

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.240
Maybe a new friendship forms, maybe a new business relationship forms.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:47.240
Who knows?

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.600
The possibilities are endless.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:53.240
But I do think that like by being able to gamify these connections that are we seeing

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:59.760
in Discord, in Twitter, like in a digital space and bringing that out into the real world,

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:03.120
I think that that's where like the real secret sauce is.

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.400
And that's what gets me the most excited about what we're doing.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.400
Okay.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:09.440
Very interesting.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:20.880
What are the things that we should have discussed about 9DCC or the challenges opportunity setup

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:24.680
future that we haven't discussed yet, that we should cover?

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:29.400
I think, you know, we, I think overall through the entire presentation, we've been discussing

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:33.520
it, but I want to really lean into like the composability of it, right?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:38.480
Which is really like what makes crypto so powerful is composability, right?

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:43.200
And everything that we've been talking about, and I think the hotel room example that you

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:49.080
use is a great example of it is like when you can take, you know, non-fungible slash

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:55.720
semi-fungible assets and make them as composable as possible, what, you know, how valuable does

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:57.080
that become, right?

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:01.400
And so I'll use the t-shirt says an example, but you can also technically use it against

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.480
like hotel inventory, right?

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:09.120
Of being able to then post that as collateral in an NFT lending platform and take out a

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120
loan against it.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.840
Like, I think I probably took out the first on-chain loan against a t-shirt about two

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.280
months ago, where I posted as collateral.

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:21.440
I had somebody that was willing to lend me money against it.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:28.920
And now people that own a 9DCC shirt can then post it as collateral and get a $125 loan

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.520
almost instantaneously by posting as collateral.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:38.640
And I think that these value unlocks that start to happen in markets that are very immature

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:41.240
that don't have access to this type of capital, right?

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:45.000
Because what I'm describing is a margin loan against a stock.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.880
It is a mortgage against a piece of real estate.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.160
It's nothing that's very esoteric or complex in the traditional finance world, but you're

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.000
going to open up these markets and give people access to this capital that otherwise might

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.200
not have had it.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.080
And that all really comes from composability.

01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:06.560
Very interesting.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.800
Let's go see the other slides.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.640
There's some examples and I think one of them is your partner, so we can actually, I want

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.360
to get your views on them.

01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.000
I think they're in some of the slides.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:24.640
So, Materiam, this has been going on, they've been working on this for a while and it's

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:30.740
not the case, but my understanding and we might next running of the course get the founder

01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:36.720
Vini to talk to him about it.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.920
The general, I'm going to summarize it, it might be wrong.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.880
But like my general views they spend a lot of time thinking about the contractual aspects.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:52.720
I don't think they worry so much about the gamification, or there are mental levels, how

01:09:52.720 --> 01:10:02.640
make sure that the sales of these assets in ABCD jurisdictions are legally binding and

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:09.520
have a legally binding contract that people can use. Do you have a different sense of

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.280
how they think about it? I think that's the way they think about it. I spoke to Vinay

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:22.000
I think almost two years ago at this point but from my understanding he was thinking about it

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:30.320
at more of the contractual level and how you can maybe sell a piece of real estate on chain

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:36.560
between a counterparty in let's say Europe and the United States and dealing with the laws

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.960
and how that works. So I think he's thinking at a very high level in terms of that.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.240
Yeah we need to get him on in the spring and talk to him. He's very interesting.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:54.240
I follow him on Twitter he's very interesting so it'll be good to get his views. What's the next one

01:10:54.240 --> 01:11:00.560
VT? All right so 4k I think you should present the slide in

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:08.320
Talisman 4k since you're an actual customer 4k. Yep I mean I love the product. I had

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:16.320
I originally wanted to make create a centralized custodian back in I think it was December of 2020

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:24.080
where I remember when Nifty Gateway did the the beable drop and there was I think it was like

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.480
an eight-week trading window where you can trade the digital asset and then there was like a six-week

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:33.920
claim window where you can claim the physical the physical piece that came with the drop.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:38.960
And I remember reaching out to somebody on the customer support staff I'm like well

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:45.040
you're gonna you're gonna crush the trading like one-step physical window is done because

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:50.240
I know there's gonna be more value I think long-term in keeping the digital and the physical

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:56.160
component combined. I think we saw a lot of people over the last like you know two years really

01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:01.200
disconnect that because people didn't necessarily care about the physical component but I do think

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:06.160
long-term people are gonna want both of those together. So I really early on I was like there's

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.400
going to be a need for this centralized custodian much the same way that free ports exist in that

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.240
yeah I'm gonna I'm in a whole this physical asset someplace because I don't need to take possession

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:25.040
of it but I do want to have the access to a 24-7 global marketplace and at the time

01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:30.800
like I spoke to a few lawyers and nobody had any idea what an NFT was and when I explained the

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:38.240
contract it really was I feel they they didn't I think they didn't totally understand it and I

01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.880
spoke to a few people and it seemed like there would be enough legal risk that I didn't necessarily

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:49.680
want to do it as a US citizen living in US jurisdiction but I said I will like if I find the

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:55.520
founder that wants to do this this is like I think this would be a massive business I was introduced

01:12:55.520 --> 01:13:03.680
to to Richard maybe like maybe a year ago or yeah maybe a year ago a year and a half ago and I

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:09.200
mean I loved it obviously because I had that idea organically myself as well and I saw that he was

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.640
already doing it and so you know we spent a lot of time talking and what I think is really interesting

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.800
and I had him on my podcast a few months ago was being able to bring like a lot of different

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.920
um ask real-world assets on chain like he even said like the possibility of bringing like

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.840
like the caretaking of an animal on chain and I think he has to figure out the logistics of that

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:36.880
but I'm like ultimately the world where it's like you know like um those like you know take you

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:42.320
know pay a dollar a day to like feed like a monkey or something like you could technically run

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:49.040
something like that off the 4k protocol which I think becomes like very interesting um and like

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:54.240
I don't know the legality of the complexities of that but at the very least right is like you can

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.360
take you know something like a Rolex watch something like I have some sneakers that are custody there

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:05.280
I have 90 cc shirts that are custody there but then also by building out on the protocol layer

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:11.360
then other people can create also their own storage on top of that right so it's like if I have an

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:19.680
empty warehouse here in my backyard I can then take custody and um verify that let's say that Rolex

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:25.600
is real and that it's stored in a location in a safe location uh and be part of that 4k network

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:31.280
that ultimately starts originally with their protocol but then builds out globally and like

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:36.160
what does that mean for the implications is that network builds out so I I think that there's like

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.520
a lot of really cool stuff that that can be done with this right and what I'm I'm really interested

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:47.200
about on the uh on the composability layer is now being able to take that real world asset

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.640
and then use it as collateral for other things right and I think this is where

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:59.280
when you have that zero to one moment where I think it's going to be very difficult there's

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.040
going to be a harder time bringing real estate on chain then there will be bringing watches on

01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:12.080
chain or sneakers on chain because financing mechanisms for those two industries that I just

01:15:12.080 --> 01:15:19.520
said don't exist on a global scale yet whereas you know getting a mortgage for real estate is like

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:25.040
it's a massively global business that already has its processes flow and place and it already has

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:29.760
you know its industry and its people with vested interests whereas if you're able to take something

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.240
from zero to one and provide capital and provide access to capital and financing that a market

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:40.880
might not already have I think you're going to see faster adoption than you will you know I

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.320
firmly believe real estate comes on chain I just think it will take much longer because there's

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:55.280
already a mature industry around it makes perfect sense what's the next let's go to the next slide

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:07.120
do you know about corn lord I do I'm I angel invested into it they're very similar to 4k right they do

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:14.480
physical custody of assets and issue you in nft they've teamed up with with brinks as their

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:21.600
vaulting partner so you know they've had a few drops I believe their first drops might have been

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:29.680
on polygon I'm not exactly sure I think they were on on an L2 to start but I'm not sure where they're

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:42.640
they're currently issuing their nft's okay and what do we have next and then I'm Ericana I think

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:50.640
it's trying to be the open sea for physically backed nft's right is that are you are you very familiar

01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:58.640
with them I'm not very familiar with them I know that they're chipping products and creating I think

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:03.600
a marketplace for those products I haven't I haven't had the opportunity to chat with their team

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:14.320
very closely just like you know in passing at you know at like a cocktail hour or something

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:23.120
okay do we have anything else let's see do you want to take on the artifact sneakers I think I

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:27.840
know how they work but you brought you might you probably pay more attention to the details

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:34.000
yeah I mean listen artifact I think they've been trailblazers in the category right and you know

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:39.280
I think they they got acquired by Nike because of you know all the cool things that they were doing

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:45.680
I think that you know all the things that they've done have been like really pushing boundaries and

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:51.840
I you know I think most people know what they do and you know they've created these digital

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:57.360
components and then also for the most part usually have these forging windows where you can then

01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.000
claim physical product at which point they fulfill that product and then send it out

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.840
and I believe it's interesting to watch these different drop mechanics and you know I know this

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:14.080
as well because I'm going through it with the stuff that I'm doing at 90cc whereas I you know I

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:19.760
don't know if we have found out like the best drop mechanics just yet so I think you're gonna see a

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:26.240
lot of playing around with how drops work with how you know how do you fulfill physical product

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:31.120
right because especially when it comes to something like clothes or sneakers where everyone wears a

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:39.280
different size you can't necessarily pre-sell sizing but you know because then you fragment

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.920
the market a little too much right and it's like what you know what is that right balance between

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.960
liquidity and the right balance between getting the product out there and and time frames but

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.000
you know I think artifact has has done an amazing job for the physical digital space

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.720
over the last two years and you know they're they're always going to be a team to watch

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:05.440
and you know for the audience I think most people know that they're now owned by Nike right and so

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:14.000
I view them not just as an interesting organization but my guess is this is like the

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:22.320
R&D lab for these ideas in Nike in general and the ones that are successful will probably see

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:30.000
rolled out at Nike scale which is just an absolutely gigantic scale right like so

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.280
yeah and I look at this and I think when you want to talk about you know mass adoption

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:42.880
and consumer adoption like you know when you have brands like Nike and Adidas coming into the space

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:48.720
like you know I mean it's almost inevitable that you know you at some point soon you will be getting

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:53.680
adoption because these are brands that drive culture right these are brands that you know

01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.080
probably you know Nike's probably one of the coolest brands on the planet right and so

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:04.720
whatever it is that they do and to your point is I I would take a strong guess that artifact is

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.800
almost like their web 3 R&D team and when things work within artifact then they start scaling that

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:15.040
across their organization and that's when you're going to start seeing a lot of people start to

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:22.240
get onboarded into the space you had actually helped bring Adidas into the space right

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:28.880
yep I partnered with them board apes and punk's comic for their for their initial drop

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:37.120
and how did you and I'm curious for me I don't know procedural perspective you're

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:45.680
sitting there you want some NFTs you think you think big companies should do this but I assume

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:53.040
these big companies don't didn't then know really much about NFTs how did you make that happen

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:01.760
um so you know I got randomly DM'd by somebody on their team who told me you know he loved what

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:09.200
I was doing he worked at Adidas on their web 3 on their web 3 team and he wanted to chat now I had

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.920
no idea if he really worked at Adidas or not but I figured you know what's a 20 minute phone call

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:19.360
like you know what if he really does work at Adidas it turned out he did and you know we ended up

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.880
having these like amazing conversations because because my thesis and my thought process behind

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:31.200
you know working with any large organization is that I want them to onboard onto crypto rails

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:36.320
onto decentralized rails right because at some point right and this is almost like the world we

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:43.360
live in now is you know your your conglomerates that exist in the legacy world today will try to

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:48.080
you know do something that is let's say web 3 but not entirely web 3 you'll be like let's say within

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:54.320
their their wall garden of an ecosystem and they'll call it web 3 you'll be let's say a digital

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:59.520
collectible but there won't be true ownership there and so you know the more of these brands that we

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:05.120
can build on truly decentralized rails then the better it is for all of us as consumers right

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:10.560
like when you think about when you see all these movies about these dystopian futures of what that

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:16.640
world looks like usually it's where there's you know one one person or a small council of people

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:22.480
deciding and making decisions for all of humanity and people you know don't have any say in what they

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:29.360
can do with their assets right and the more digital our lives become then the more that these high

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:35.840
councils can control what it is and and what it is and what we do with with our assets and so that's

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:41.840
why for me like building on Ethereum building on you know EVM compatible chains is something that

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:47.680
I firmly believe in because there is you know asset ownership there where okay maybe if you

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.880
violate the terms of service you can't play in that world but the assets you own are still yours

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:59.120
right there's there's always that story that people say of you know how I think Vitalik was banned

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.520
from World of Warcraft and that was like part of his reasoning for creating Ethereum right where

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:10.880
he lost you know he found like a bug in the system was able to take advantage of it but then lost his

01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:16.400
account and lost all of his work because of it when and and that's like well I should have ownership

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.640
over my property because I paid for it right like you know how valuable would it be to a gamer that

01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:27.920
you know let's say spent a thousand dollars on Fortnite the size they don't want to play Fortnite anymore

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.160
right instead of just having a thousand dollars of sunk you know skin cost that they can never get

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:36.720
back if they can get some sort of return on that saying like okay somebody else wants to buy these

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:43.840
I don't want to own them and I think that you know the more that we can teach these brands to build

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:49.440
on these truly decentralized rails I think the better it will be for society because then that

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.280
leads to more adoption on those decentralized rails which leads to more ownership over your

01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:04.080
personal property in the future I couldn't agree with you more this is I think where we are fully

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:11.120
aligned I think you and I focus on different things but the general objective is the same that the

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:17.120
more we can get people to use standardized public interoperable rails the better the world will be

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:28.000
in the long run okay let's shift gears and take some questions for the from the audience and I'll

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:40.880
go vp I'll go into the discord so that I can find the questions as they're being asked and give me a

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:48.240
second I will see what what the people want to know

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:59.920
all right privacy concerned walking around with a scalable NFC could lead to dioxing or even

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:06.000
tracking how do we protect privacy with NFC readable wearables risks of document tracking and

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:12.480
it's a good question well how do you think about this um so with regards to tracking we don't

01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:20.480
track any data right the NFC chips are like not powered right so that so there's no like tracking

01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:26.640
of personal data all you do is basically like you can scan you know where that shirt is at one

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:33.280
point in time right and you know this is something I've thought long about as well with you know and

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:39.760
I think we're probably going to be moving towards a world of zk right where you can uh at test that

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.720
somebody was somewhere without that person necessarily having to sew things on blockchain I just don't

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:50.880
think that the tech is there just yet but I do think long term you know people will be able to

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:56.400
turn on or turn off like you know privacy concerns and certain stuff like yeah I don't want you know

01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:03.680
let's say um people that collect my po-op to kind of know where I am at a given point in time if let's

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:09.040
say I'm at a party at a specific event right and this already exists with let's say when people scan

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:16.080
po-ops uh per se is like you scan in uh you collect the po-op for that event um you have to be there

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.680
to collect that po-op I think over time we'll probably see a move towards whether it's zk or

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:28.880
maybe not everything is stored on chain or you have the opportunity to kind of um send that po-op

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:33.920
like after the fact so you don't necessarily know who's there in real time um I think that these

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.400
are all concerns I've definitely thought about it I just I feel like at the at this point in time

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.760
we're like in the proof of concept phase that we can then iterate on and tackle those privacy

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:49.600
concerns but I I definitely you know as somebody you know as pretty much everybody on the planet

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:54.720
is probably tracked through their phone uh realizing how important that data is and making sure that

01:26:55.280 --> 01:27:00.160
you have the trust you know you have our trust that you know we're not collecting you know real

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:05.200
time data on where you are uh in order to you know geotarget or whatever have you

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:13.040
right and I don't know if the question was meant that you attract them could someone I don't know

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:22.160
how the tech works could someone use a remote reader to scan someone's shirt at a distance

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:29.920
no I I don't like because because of the like the the like the communication field for that is

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:35.920
solo like you have to you have to put your phone like very close uh to the actual chip in order

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:40.720
to get because again there's no power in the chip so it's kind of powered by the device that

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:47.840
scans it so the device has to be close to kind of like utilize it sorry that's the the near field

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:55.360
and NFC right like so I if I were wearing the shirt and someone wanted to scan my NFC chip

01:27:55.360 --> 01:28:01.280
I'd notice because they'd be right next to me yeah they they'd be rubbing their phone up against your

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:10.160
shirt could be awkward it could be um okay here's the question how many people put their shirts

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:15.040
in storage I guess your initial drop how many people said give me this t-shirt I'm wearing it

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:23.280
down in Miami and how many have kept it in the vault for future results yep so um from the initial

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:29.520
drop I think we're at a little bit above 40% of people that took delivery of the shirt to wear it

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:39.600
and from the second drop I think we're at around 50% um you know we we did about 50% um live in Miami

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:44.720
of the mint because we really wanted to showcase the you know the actual generative manufacturing

01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:50.400
process live on the ground and then uh you know I think the interesting thing about the second drop

01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:56.400
is it's probably more of a collectible as well it's like it's an affordable chromisquiggle uh

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:02.080
interestingly enough there was a father son uh his son had always wanted a chromisquiggle but

01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:07.120
they were priced out of it um because they found out about swiggles too late he took his son out of

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.440
school for a day and they flew down together had this experience where he minted a squiggle a shirt

01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:19.760
as a squiggle variant and now that like his his son's uh version of a squiggle so I think that like

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:24.880
wow the interesting thing is going to be uh you know seeing that like collectibility play into

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.680
things as well because there you know this one this is a rift right so this one is rarer than than a

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:38.400
floor next question are there companies out there working to build platforms specifically

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:43.840
the designs to enable this concept of moving from databases to markets across industries

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:49.360
I'm aware of teams doing this individually fly fishing restaurants links down and golf

01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:54.800
but is anyone building out the tooling to do it across industries I have answers but let me hear

01:29:54.800 --> 01:30:01.360
your answer but I'll comment on this I don't know anybody that's trying to build a platform like

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:07.120
this at scale I think even as you were presenting it I feel like it becomes very industry specific

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:12.480
because I think some of the hardest stuff is to get the buy-in right like I think you have to be

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:20.800
in the travel industry and very high up to be able to convince like you know uh booking.com

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:27.760
Expedia and all these companies to come into this same protocol so I think it becomes very

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:33.680
industry specific at least for the foreseeable future but I but maybe I'm wrong I'd love to hear

01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:45.520
what you think 6529 yeah um I guess my super abstract view of this is that if the outcome

01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:54.800
um is anyway NFTs NFTs are the platform right like the whole point generally

01:30:57.120 --> 01:31:04.720
network type protocols whether it's TCP IP or SMTP or Bitcoin right FTS works specifically

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:10.160
because you don't have to get everyone to agree to do something together right like the social

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:14.720
coordination costs are really high because you're just oh I want to do my platforms I was all

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.960
know I have a better idea I'll do it this way than someone else who I have I have access to the

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:25.920
market in France and I'm going to do it this other way and so and I think a lot of these are going

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:33.040
to need industry specific tooling right the solution for how it works on restaurants is going to be

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:39.120
different than golf courses which is also going to be different than apartments which will also

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:47.280
be different than fashion and so for me I don't know I don't know what a generic tooling would look

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:53.920
like other than the generic tooling being NFTs and so like if people do whatever they're going to do

01:31:53.920 --> 01:32:04.800
on their individual workflow but in the end um people can uh represent their claims when NFT

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:13.760
then you get to pick up as the issuer all of the infrastructure that is being built generically

01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:19.520
for NFTs right like you don't have to build a marketplace there's going to be many marketplaces

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:25.760
right you don't have to build a lending platform you don't have to build the gallery to display

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.160
them right because people are going to be building these things for NFTs as a whole and if we get

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:41.360
like a couple of years in the future another maybe order of magnitude worth of adoption in

01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:46.480
people and applications I think it's over right like then the incentives you're not going to have

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:54.080
to like tell companies things about like decentralization it will just be obvious that if they issue

01:32:54.080 --> 01:33:01.760
their claim as an NFT it is better for them than trying to build an end-to-end infrastructure by

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:07.440
themselves because they'll never keep up with literally the whole internet building infrastructure

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:17.040
for brc721s and 1155s or whatever the the variations will be on other blockchains right so I think

01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:27.520
that's where I come out of this one the next question is for me um I will laugh about this one

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:33.440
can we use NFTs as proof of knowledge passing courses college courses etc really yes there

01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:36.400
if you pass the exam with other those courses you're going to get an NFT absolutely

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:46.320
you are in specifically the um the service that we'll use NFT as a proof of knowledge

01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:54.000
okay i think i have a follow up on that for you um when when you issue those NFTs will they be

01:33:54.000 --> 01:34:01.600
sold out so this is a great question and I have discussed this in great detail with the unit team

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:14.080
and that it all start with a conclusion they will not be sold out and I'll tell you why because

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:20.720
that was their first question maybe sold out if I have an educational credential that I'm

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:30.480
going to keep for years decades right well the odds that my wallet is not going to be different

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:39.760
20 years from now is literally zero right I've gone through three wallets or ready since I started

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.240
with NFTs and looking maybe me as well I have I have my nuisance wallet my safe vault maybe

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:52.000
won't change but the odds that the average person in this class is not going to change their wallet

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:59.920
zero zero like people might have started with a hot wall then maybe they might go to a treasure

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.720
maybe they'll go to some social recovery wall maybe they'll later go to a multi-sick wallet I mean

01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:09.760
and this I think all these things are going to happen in the next 18 months not in the next like

01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:18.720
18 years right so a model where we say oh it's so bound because a model where people are going to

01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:24.080
get stuck needing to move them and then what that's going to be is someone is going to have to come

01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:32.400
to UNIC and say move it to this new wallet and I need to somehow explain to you that I'm the same

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:50.160
person and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I believe it is operationally impossible right and for this to exist over decades right so I start with I don't think the soulbound model generally works I'm not

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:52.360
actually quite bearish on the Soulbound model.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.840
I think it needs to be solved with other ways.

01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:57.720
And it's like, oh, do the other ways are problems?

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:58.520
Yes.

01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.240
It's just the Soulbound one.

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:04.320
Effectively, the only way you solve the Soulbound

01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.360
is to just make it centralized.

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:08.840
But if you make it centralized,

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.160
then Munich might as well just keep it in their database

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:14.840
of people who have completed the course, right?

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:16.160
Then what's the difference?

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:17.720
You can always call up Munich and say,

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.280
hey, did I complete this course, right?

01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:21.000
So that's back in one.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:24.960
And then it's interesting to see what Munich

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.960
and other academic institutions did in the past.

01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.960
So I don't know if you ever discussed this on this course,

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:33.520
one of their, they had, I think,

01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:36.000
where the first issue to plume was on the blockchain

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.840
as on the Bitcoin blockchain.

01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.920
Pretty long before and if these.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.720
And their solutions were interesting

01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:48.320
because it is, it was a hash into the Bitcoin blockchain

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:49.920
and you got a PDF and those are merciful

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.800
for all these things that we're using now

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.000
for allow us to what have you.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.440
And you could check if the hash of your PDF

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.880
was in that transaction, right?

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:04.720
So there it was interesting

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.320
because it wasn't even in your wallet at all, right?

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.760
You just have a PDF.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.000
And that PDF you could check if it was,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.360
it's like the end of Sicha, right?

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.400
Like you can say I have this off chain good,

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.160
but I can tell you if it exists

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.880
on chain transaction.

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.480
So that's one model, it's portable with the user, right?

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:25.680
So that's one interesting model.

01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:27.640
Now on NFTs,

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.280
and I think what's gonna happen on this course,

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:39.240
though George and I haven't finalized it,

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:40.920
well, there's a couple of things you can do.

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:44.120
First of all, we're gonna let people

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.280
if they choose put their name on it, right?

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:49.680
If they put their name on it,

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:55.880
they have to pick one person that it is, right?

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.160
So if you want to say,

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.280
if I say I'm Mike Smith, I completed this course,

01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:04.560
selling my Sicha, I was like,

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:06.680
oh, what if they sell their credentials, right?

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.200
Well, if my credentials are Mike Smith,

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.960
and I sell them to Sally,

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.040
what good is it gonna do Sally?

01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.320
Right, like I'd have to find another Mike Smith.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.840
And I was like, well, I don't wanna do that,

01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.840
I wanna put my ETH address.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.560
Okay, that's fine.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:28.400
You can put 6.5 to 9. ETH.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:33.200
But then it's really only relevant to whoever

01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:38.200
has built up reputation as 6.5 to 9. ETH, right?

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:41.760
And it's not generically sellable, right?

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:43.520
I mean, why is that gonna be useful?

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:44.960
What'll be useful to you?

01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:46.720
If you said, like, hey, look,

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.520
I completed the course, here's my certificate.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:51.240
And on the certificate on the NFT,

01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.120
it says 6.5 to 9. ETH.

01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:56.600
I was like, wait, that's not you, right?

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.440
Is it all well?

01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:59.480
What if,

01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.120
or what if someone takes the course

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:04.440
in someone else's name?

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:07.160
Well, sure, that's a risk,

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.280
but that's not solved by sold-bound token.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:11.640
That's solved by KYC, right?

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.960
And so then there's an interesting question.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:16.640
Do you want to, you know, obviously for,

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:19.960
I understand if you complete,

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:22.880
go on from this course and do the degree program,

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.720
you will effectively get KYC

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.480
because the University want transcripts

01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:28.120
and all these other things and like,

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:30.120
you're, I don't know, driver's license passport,

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:30.960
I don't know what they'll need,

01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.280
but like, you don't get KYC, right?

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.960
Now for a course like this,

01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.440
where someone is going to show their credential

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.520
in their wallet, right?

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.880
To me, the right answer,

01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:47.200
they're in the right balance

01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:50.720
between decentralization and practicality

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.720
is that it's not sold-bound,

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:58.720
that people can either put a physical name on it,

01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:02.960
or they can put an enist name on it,

01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:05.640
and then they can move it from place to place,

01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:06.760
and you know, their physical name

01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.640
is going to stay with them the rest of your life,

01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:12.520
presumably, and your enist can actually transport

01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:15.680
across wallets, right?

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:20.600
I might change, I'm using some model treasure

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:23.760
at 6.529.eth, right?

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.160
Do I think in 20 years,

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.920
the same treasure is going to be working now,

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.080
I'm pretty sure it won't be, right?

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.640
I'm pretty sure we're using something else,

01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:33.960
but I can certainly 6.529.eth, right?

01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:37.600
And if I had a certificate that was issued and signed

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.960
by 6.529.eth, okay, what differences it make

01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:45.240
if it's in the difference of theorematics?

01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:47.120
So, that's how we're thinking about it.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.920
I think we'll be making some decisions soon,

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:54.080
and we'll probably like, tweet about it

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:56.440
and what the trade-offs are,

01:40:56.440 --> 01:41:01.520
but I just think you have to assume that the soulbound token

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:05.000
concept is effectively for this purpose,

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.320
unworkable, or indistinguishable with being centralized,

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:12.480
and then see how you work out those solutions.

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.720
Yeah, and I tend to agree with that.

01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:16.400
I've been thinking a lot about it, right?

01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:18.760
Where it's like, it's almost like,

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.840
effectively you're creating like an account, right?

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.160
And then each wallet is almost like a sub account

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.760
associated with that account.

01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.360
And to your point is like, you don't know,

01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.240
you know, you don't know if you're going to use your wallet

01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:31.120
for the rest of your life, probably not, right?

01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:33.000
Because of the nature of technology.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.480
So you need to have that ability to self-transfer things.

01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:37.960
So that makes sense to me.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.440
I think that that's probably, and I think delegate cash

01:41:40.440 --> 01:41:43.040
is probably one of those examples, right?

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.320
Of like almost creating like a user account,

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:48.480
and then you have all these sub accounts,

01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:51.080
and you can then sexualize risk, right?

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:54.200
From a different perspective, but I do think that like,

01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.840
these rules apply to that as well.

01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:59.520
Yeah, delegate cash fixes another problem,

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:02.160
which is an all the delegation solutions,

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.240
which is not minting from your cold wallet, right?

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.880
But I think for this problem of which,

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.480
the other people, the reason people always ask

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.000
it like is it so modern on is,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:12.840
but what if someone else gets the certifications

01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.080
of the person at the course, right?

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.440
But I think the answer to that is,

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.800
you can put a name on it, but your name can also

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:22.200
be a real name or it can be an ENS.

01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:27.200
And the ENS abstracts away,

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.840
not just a hot wallet, it can abstract away your name wall.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.560
No, right?

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:35.520
Now, let's say someone's self,

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.080
let's say I sell my whole digital identity, okay, fine,

01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.200
but like, honestly, I'm gonna sell my whole digital identity.

01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:45.440
I'm not gonna do it because of a certificate

01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:46.640
from a MOOC course, right?

01:42:46.640 --> 01:42:51.640
I mean, like there's bigger issues at play there than this, right?

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:55.880
And it's putting the card,

01:42:55.880 --> 01:42:58.520
if tomorrow you turn into six times a night,

01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:00.320
I think it's okay, fine, but like,

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.040
I don't think the real issue is that you'll also

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:04.200
get my MOOC certificate.

01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.320
Yeah, makes total sense.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:14.760
Okay, I think this was a great session.

01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.440
I think we've ran basically,

01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.880
we try to keep them an hour and a half,

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:21.320
maximum two, we're right on time.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:23.680
I want to thank you so much for coming and joining.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:26.200
We very much appreciate you taking the time.

01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:29.320
It is great to learn from practitioners in the field.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:34.120
We now have, this is for the members,

01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:38.120
we now have our minting ton of T-word for faster,

01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:40.320
so this will mint us in an FTE, I think soon,

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.720
maybe by next week we'll have the site

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:46.440
where students in the course can mint NFT

01:43:46.440 --> 01:43:48.680
of any of these sessions and keep them seeing them,

01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:50.640
or just review them online

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:53.880
or we need to get them into the campus as well.

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:57.760
And it will be there as a resource going forward.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.680
So it's not just the core certificate

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.040
that's going to be NFT,

01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.520
each piece of course material is also NFT,

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.240
including this session.

01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:12.160
And so the people can benefit from it over time.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.840
All right, well, thank you.

01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:42.480
And I think we can wrap this up.
