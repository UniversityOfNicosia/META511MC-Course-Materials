1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,280
Okay.

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,340
Hello, everyone.

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,840
We are back in session.

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,520
It is 2023 and we have two more sessions to go.

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:38,080
I am excited to be doing today's session on off-chain or physical objects or claims that

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:45,480
are linked to NFTs with the very, very well-known Chi Money, who is not just one of the great

7
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,920
collectors of the space and he is a business builder in the space and has done a lot of

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,640
interesting physical objects.

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,920
So, first of all, welcome to the course, sir.

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,680
Well, thank you for having me.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,040
It's a pleasure to be on and it's definitely an honor.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,960
So what we're going to do today is kind of a mix of a presentation and a discussion.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:20,160
I'd like to go VTE through a few background slides to make sure everyone gets up there.

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,040
Make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of the concepts.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,080
Then we'll work through some examples and then, since we have the founder of a, actually,

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:42,240
one of our example slides, dig into detail like why it was done this way, what's the

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,440
opportunity or what does this look like over time.

18
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,360
And so we'll go that way.

19
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,560
And at any point, G Money, if I'm off-base on something or I didn't say something that

20
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,600
you think should be out of just jumping even during the slides.

21
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Okay, great.

22
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay.

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,680
Did I have control of the slides?

24
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,920
I don't seem to have control of the slides.

25
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,880
Huh.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,720
I do.

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:26,760
I don't seem to be able to switch the slide.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:35,640
I think you might have control of the slides, I think.

29
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Yeah.

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Keep going.

31
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Yeah, keep going.

32
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
Keep going.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Keep going.

34
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
All right.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:57,320
So the session of the course we titled it Off-chain Objects.

36
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,200
And then I thought to myself, is that right?

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,360
I mean, it's sort of, it is, of course, right.

38
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,160
But I was also playing around with a couple of other words, physical objects, right?

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,880
Because there's some things that are off-chain but digital, like, you know, are we right, PFS?

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,720
That is true for a lot of NFTs.

41
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
But I think that's something different than what we're discussing here.

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,320
And then I was wondering even if the word objects was correct.

43
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,320
And I think it's not, or it's partially correct, but it's not fully comprehensive.

44
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,000
I think the right word is claims because we could be representing things that are not

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,240
an object, but for example, could be an experience.

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:48,240
If you have an NFT that represents a ticket to a concert or a night in a hotel room, it's

47
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
not an object.

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,320
You know, you haven't gotten the concert hall.

49
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,360
But it is a claim in the physical world.

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:02,040
And I think for the purpose of this session, that's my mental framework that we're talking

51
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,400
about, you know, the other 11 sessions of the course we're talking about natively digital

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
assets all the way through.

53
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,560
This is the session where we're talking about physical matters.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,920
And physical in this case claims, which I think this is the right model.

55
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,920
Now what type of things could they represent?

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:33,720
And this is in no way an exhaustive list, exhaustive list is everything in the world.

57
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,880
So I'm not going to start writing down every single thing in the world.

58
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,800
But evident crypto a long time.

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,560
And this idea of representing physical objects with crypto tokens predates NFTs.

60
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,920
We've been talking about this for many, many years.

61
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,720
A lot of people tried to do it with fungible tokens, they turned it with colored coins.

62
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,480
And the areas that people typically start with the ones that I've heard over and over

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,040
and over again, are no particular order real estate, clothing, precious stones or gold or

64
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
what have you.

65
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
It's where people start, right?

66
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,600
Because I think these are things that might have sufficient value that people think about

67
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,720
them and they're easy enough to make the mental leap.

68
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,160
Maybe someday are washing machine will be represented by NFT, but it's a harder mental

69
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,120
leap to see how that works, right?

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,600
So and then the claim may not just be ownership, right?

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Could be ownership.

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,040
Could be that if you own this NFT, you own this physical object, do that.

73
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,000
It could be rental.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,520
If you own the SINF T, you have access to this car or holiday home for this week.

75
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,320
It could be access.

76
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,560
If you own the SINF T, you can come to this country club.

77
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,240
If you own the SINF T, you can go to this concert.

78
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,520
If you own the SINF T, you can have dinner once a week with dream money.

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,360
It's a physical claim, right?

80
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:24,280
Redemption, which in all it's kind of similar to ownership, but I split it because I think

81
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,520
it's a different implementation form.

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:32,920
So there's people who say, well, you own the NFT and the NFT and the physical note together.

83
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,080
And as long as you own an NFT and you can redeem the NFT for the physical and the NFT

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,280
goes away, right?

85
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,400
And so the first is almost like a gift voucher.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
It's not a good one.

87
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,040
It's kind of like a gift voucher for a physical object.

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,600
Whereas the redemption model is whereas the ownership model and they go together and they're

89
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
permanently together.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,200
The NFT never gets burnt.

91
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,120
And you no longer have the physical object.

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
You send the NFT to the next person.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,720
So the NFT and the physical object always live together.

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,200
And then there's this, I was thinking about it, but it also exists in the art NFT world

95
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,520
with some people have made blended or hybrid objects.

96
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,080
I am absolutely not going to write the word digital in the presentation.

97
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:29,320
But we bought a few of them recently and it's a beautiful NFT, but it also comes with a physical

98
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,680
painting in a frame.

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:40,520
And those are meant to be a unified piece of artwork, the NFT and the physical object

100
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
that comes with the art.

101
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,720
I'm sure there are other examples than what I mentioned here, but I think this is the

102
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,360
80%, 90% correct.

103
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,800
I think we're going to think about it.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,960
I think you'd add here, Jimin.

105
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,520
Yeah, I think to add one thing that I want to be immediately, the things that I thought

106
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,520
of immediately as to what is an NFT that people can conceptualize really well is a mortgage.

107
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,960
And to your point is like that's a claim.

108
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,200
And it helps people understand to the point you made earlier that pretty much everything

109
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,120
in the real world is an NFT.

110
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,480
We just don't call them NFTs.

111
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all correct.

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:36,920
That we have that we work with abstracted claims on physical objects is absolutely true.

113
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,320
For me, the one that I think users to describe to people is title deeds for real estate,

114
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,320
right?

115
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,400
You never transact the real estate itself.

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,480
You transact a piece of paper.

117
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,000
When you buy a house, you're not, even if you're buying a piece of land on a mountainside,

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,680
the land doesn't know anything's changed, right?

119
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,600
Maybe there's a fence, maybe there's a lot of fence, but nothing has changed the moment

120
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,040
you buy it from someone.

121
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,000
What has changed is we've shuffled around a piece of paper in someone's office.

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,680
And then when we have accepted as a social construction that the person who has access

123
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,720
to do things with that land is the person whose name and the county registrar's office,

124
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,760
right, where the land registry in places where it's more centralized.

125
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,640
And it is no more, but no less abstracted than how NFTs work, right?

126
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
And because a lot of people say, oh, but NFTs are just making it up.

127
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,040
There's no real linkage between NFT and there's no real linkage between the title deed and

128
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
your land.

129
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,600
The linkage is a social construction.

130
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:58,120
And in the case of land, a set of laws and regulations that say, well, if I have this,

131
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,240
I'm allowed to be here.

132
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,800
And if G money comes into my field, I can ask him to leave.

133
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,800
And if he does, I can call him the power of the state to get him out of here, right?

134
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
But the physical land doesn't know anything about this.

135
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
It's just a piece of land, right?

136
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,240
The thing that matters is the piece of paper in the office.

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:19,520
And so I think one way to think about it is we're talking about replacing that piece

138
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:25,200
of paper that is sitting in someone's filing cabinet or now on some databases where they

139
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,400
publicly visible, transactable, composable, talking.

140
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
All right.

141
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,920
Let's go to the expansion.

142
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,720
Now, physical claims do require a trusted counterparty, right?

143
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:47,320
And this is the major difference from the rest of digitally native tokens.

144
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,400
By the way, this is the way all society works, right?

145
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,680
So this isn't a negative statement.

146
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,280
This is the way how everything else in society works.

147
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:03,680
But it's important that this is a really important topic because I've seen many white papers

148
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,640
and presentations over the years that either don't understand this or like pretend not

149
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,440
to understand this, but it's important and it's different.

150
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:21,240
If I have a art blocks token in my wallet, okay, I have it in my wallet.

151
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,200
I don't need any third party, right?

152
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,120
And there, I mean, the code is on chain.

153
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,040
Like literally everything is in my wallet.

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,040
I can send it to you, you can send it back to me.

155
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,920
At no point do we need to request someone to do something in order to own the art.

156
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:50,960
Now, when we bought this funeral piece in an auction, well, they transferred the token,

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:56,760
but then also now they have to ship the physical part.

158
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:02,880
And so I have to trust that the seller, in this case, I trust them as an auction house,

159
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,240
but like that the seller is capable of like packing it up correctly and mailing it to

160
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,480
the right place and getting appropriate insurance and not breaking it and, you know, all of

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,880
these things right there, the counterparty.

162
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:21,160
And if we ever send it somewhere else, we have to do the same thing, right?

163
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,880
There's sudden the counterparty in that case was the auction house was the seller.

164
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,640
And generally, you can think about the counterparty.

165
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,280
I think it's these three categories.

166
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,640
Maybe there's a fourth that I missed.

167
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,280
The most obvious one is the issuer of the claim, right?

168
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:47,040
If 90cc says, I'm going, if you own this NFT, you get this piece of clothing.

169
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,960
Well, the most obvious counterparty is the firm is going to say, I've showed up, I've

170
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,840
redeemed the NFT, I've burned the NFT, I want my t-shirt, right?

171
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,600
And so we have to trust that the t-shirts are there and you're well organized firm and

172
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,920
you haven't lost them and you'll send them to the right place and all of these things,

173
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
right?

174
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
And the same thing is true.

175
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,920
But this is our day to day life in the whole world, like when you booked a room at Marriott,

176
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,520
you're trusting the issuer of that claim that, you know, the Marriott on Canal Street is

177
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
in fact there and operating.

178
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,720
And when you show up and you say, like, here's my reservation from booking.com, and there's

179
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:33,400
a yes, Mr. 6'5", tonight, you have room 272 and the room's clean and it's available,

180
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,240
there's not someone else in it, right?

181
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,320
You're taking on a variety of counterparty risks that, as a general rule, married is

182
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,040
very good at if they rent your room for a night, they will deliver the room for the

183
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
rent you.

184
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,880
No, and sometimes they must have the new book and the same person, right?

185
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,560
There's a little bit of counterparty risk, there's not zero.

186
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,680
But within boundaries that society operates, right, it operates more or less okay.

187
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
That's one model, right?

188
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,520
The issuer is the counterparty.

189
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:09,160
Another model that you see, and some of these startups, we mentioned here, operate as well,

190
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
there's a centralized custodian.

191
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:18,320
And you're going to say, look, we're going to have, we're going to have gold bars as NFTs

192
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,680
and diamonds as NFTs, and how do I know the diamonds really there?

193
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,600
How do I trust that the person sends me the diamond that I bought?

194
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,720
Well, me, the centralized firm that's operating this NFT, the product or marketplace, says,

195
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,760
look, I have a big vault and all the diamonds are there and you guys can trade the NFTs

196
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,680
and the diamonds are not going over, it's always here, right?

197
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,240
It's always right here, and you can always come and then redeem it and claim it and get

198
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,240
the diamond.

199
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:59,840
And so you don't have to trust every single seller if they're going to deliver, right?

200
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,280
You just need to trust the custodian, in fact, the diamonds are there.

201
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,280
And this is how all financial markets work, right?

202
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,640
I mean, when you're buying and selling shares of stock, they're held in a custodian, it

203
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,520
changes, the shares never move just in reporting of who owns them.

204
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,040
This is how literally the US stock market's working, it's a centralized custodian.

205
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:28,840
And then there's one interesting idea I saw here and I'm sure we'll see more of this,

206
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,760
where they're trying to build a network of decentralized custodians, right?

207
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,720
So there was that one custodian, there's multiple custodians in an operate, like a node in the

208
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,480
network and say, oh, I'm storing this physical object here.

209
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,840
And I was trying to think if there's like a fourth version of this was not obvious to

210
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,160
me what it would be, and the issuer of custodian or network of custodians.

211
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,960
Have you seen another model on this?

212
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,200
No, I think that's pretty comprehensive.

213
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,320
When I was going through this framework, like, I was pretty much the same.

214
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,000
And I very much felt like there would be a need very soon of having these centralized

215
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,840
custodians within crypto because to your point, it exists today, right?

216
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,600
I mean, if you were to look up what a free port is, it's a centralized custodian where

217
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,800
exactly to your model that you said with real estate is the same type of transaction that

218
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,880
happens with art already.

219
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,320
Yep.

220
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,520
And then what does the counterparty have to do?

221
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:41,080
Well, the counterparty has to make sure the claim is executed.

222
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,920
That the authenticity is matchbook on both sides, right?

223
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,680
Like, they've got to manage both sides of authenticity.

224
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,640
That the concert is actually happening, right?

225
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,600
And Taylor Swift will be there.

226
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,600
But also that the claim ticket you've come with is the right one because if they recognize

227
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,960
the wrong one, then two people are going to be fighting for that seat, right?

228
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:11,680
So that's a managed, the authenticity of the product or service and of the claim ticket.

229
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,760
And then, you know, general quality assurance, which is everything from, you know, it's not

230
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,360
broken and it's there and has a lost your soul order.

231
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Your bed hasn't been made.

232
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,600
I mean, it's an endless topic.

233
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,320
Quality assurance could mean anything.

234
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:36,240
And basically you're trusting the counterparty to deliver what is what has been bought through

235
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,240
that NFT.

236
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,240
Okay.

237
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,240
Let's go to the next slide.

238
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:51,640
Now this to me is a very big point because I've had this discussion with many people over

239
00:17:51,640 --> 00:18:00,200
the last two years and they say, okay, this is fine, but why do you need NFTs for this?

240
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,520
You have all types of databases that do this now.

241
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:15,600
If you go to Expedia or booking.com, you can go and buy a claim on a hotel room in New

242
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,240
York on January 23rd.

243
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,240
And it works fine.

244
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,240
It's just a database.

245
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:29,240
You don't need all the aggravation of crypto and wallets and gas and Ethereum and all the

246
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,240
stuff.

247
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,240
Right.

248
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,320
And it sounds at first glance like a good question.

249
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,640
And but it's actually not a very good question.

250
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
It sounds like a very good question.

251
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
It sounds like a whole gosh, right.

252
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,000
We don't need to do this.

253
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,920
And the reason the big opportunity is too full.

254
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,480
How does it work when you go to booking.com?

255
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:00,680
Well, each each hotel has its own reservation system, right?

256
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,640
And they allocate different groups to different other systems.

257
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Right.

258
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,000
They might say, I'm holding these 10 back because I'm going to do something for my conference

259
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
or whatever.

260
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Booking.com can book these whatever, 100 groups.

261
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm simplifying this.

262
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:26,360
And then you buy it on primary on primary.

263
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
It works.

264
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Okay.

265
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,520
But you still don't see the full order book, right?

266
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,520
You see what you're seeing in a certain marketplace.

267
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,160
It's like content management systems before the Internet.

268
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,960
If you went to someone's content management system, you see the content there, but there

269
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,200
might be content or in this case inventory in a different system.

270
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
And you won't see that inventory.

271
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Right.

272
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,840
So one, relatively smaller pieces.

273
00:19:52,840 --> 00:20:06,160
Well, if the inventory is just represented as an NFT, the platforms might compete on UX

274
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,440
or UI, but you'll see all of the inventory anywhere.

275
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,240
You could go directly and see all the inventory on a generic platform.

276
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,880
It opens your ether scan or whatever.

277
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,680
You could always go see the inventory.

278
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,240
But that's not the big idea.

279
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,160
The big idea is you develop a secondary market.

280
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,280
And so what do I mean by this?

281
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:39,560
Let's say it's January 23rd and I need to be New York and it's time sensitive and I haven't

282
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,280
booked my hotel.

283
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Right.

284
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
And I don't know.

285
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:49,640
There's a conference happening and you go and see, oh gosh, it's all sold out or this.

286
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,280
I mean, New York never really sells up.

287
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:56,200
But the approximate is all sold out or there's only these five options instead of the under

288
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
options.

289
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,400
Is that really true at all?

290
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:09,960
Is it really true that I cannot get a room that I am not the highest possible bidder

291
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,920
for at least one of the other rooms?

292
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,480
You almost recognize it's in fact, not true at all.

293
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,720
In fact, that night in New York, there will be some couple from Massachusetts that booked

294
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,400
the room six months ago and paid 200 bucks for it and they don't have a time sensitive

295
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,000
reason that they want to be in New York.

296
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,040
And if I could find that couple and say, hey, would you like 400 bucks and I'll take your

297
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,160
room at the 23rd and you can come back any other day.

298
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,160
You're not 10 cents.

299
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
We're just here on holiday.

300
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:47,640
You're an elderly couple and would you prefer to come back next week and also put $200 in

301
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
your pocket?

302
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,720
And ask me, oh, yes, that sounds very good.

303
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,880
Like they win and I win.

304
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,960
But there's no way to do that now, right?

305
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:04,520
Because the secondary, the claims once they're issued are fragmented.

306
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
They're missing.

307
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,320
There's no easy way to trade a digital good for currency.

308
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,600
Trustlessly, we know how this works, right?

309
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,880
There's all point of crypto.

310
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:23,280
And so if you imagined instead that every room for every night and every hotel in New

311
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,240
York was represented by an NFT and think about how opens he works today, right?

312
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,320
The interface would be a little bit different, but conceptually, you go there and go on the

313
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:46,360
page on a New York City and say January 23rd, hotels four and five star, midtown and below.

314
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:53,240
I'm putting a collection wide bid of $400.

315
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:57,160
I'm pretty certain in that world, which is always a way, right?

316
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,440
In that world, that bid would hit instantly even on a night that most hotels are supposed

317
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,640
to sold out, right?

318
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:13,360
And what this means is you can actually create secondary markets and everything.

319
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,760
And here we're going to have an intellectual discussion with somebody who's like, oh, I

320
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,960
don't like markets.

321
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,800
Why does everything have to be markets?

322
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,080
The point is in a capital economy, everything's ready markets.

323
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:35,320
This just makes the markets more correct, more efficient.

324
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:41,400
If you help people make a voluntary trade that they couldn't have made previously, you've

325
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,040
increased the utility in the world.

326
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,840
You haven't decreased them.

327
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,560
Now that, and then you can do all types of, I mean, wild things, right?

328
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:56,920
You will have people arming hotel nights, right?

329
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,760
As well, that sounds bad.

330
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:05,000
But sometimes the size of hotels, market prices will come into line.

331
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,200
I was thinking about this during COVID when some governments were like paying hotels preemptively

332
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,320
to book some rights in the future to keep them alive.

333
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:24,080
I'm saying, no, this would make more sense that the hotels could sell those claims cheaply.

334
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,680
And someone else could take on the risk that the lockdown ends and they can sell them more

335
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,000
expensive, right?

336
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,120
The hotels needed some minimal amount of cash at point X to lockdown to not go bankrupt.

337
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,960
And they had these future claims that nobody's booking because nobody knows what the lockdown

338
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,960
is ending.

339
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,120
But some financial industry will take that risk at some price.

340
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,080
There's some prices that I know I don't know what the locals are doing right in.

341
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:58,440
I'll buy the hotel room now for $30 and hope to resell it for $130.

342
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
And that happens to some degree with travel agents.

343
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:11,880
But again, just like NFTs, what they're doing to the fine art market, right, is democratizing.

344
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,920
If you wanted to buy, if you wanted to buy a key pairing, you basically have to walk into

345
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,120
one of X places in the world, what's the price?

346
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
Visically.

347
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:31,160
If you want to buy a ringer, you just need an internet connection.

348
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,480
And there's no specific extra advantage you have if you're a fancy institutional investor,

349
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:45,960
if you're an art expert, if you are just a random person, you have the same first class

350
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,360
access to the distribution rails for fine art.

351
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,560
For everyone in the world instantaneously, it's amazing.

352
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Also true for artists.

353
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,160
I mean, I mean, I'm an obvious institutional artist.

354
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,640
Distribution rails can't fix them, right?

355
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:08,760
But the fact that you, brand new artists, you can be an 18 year old in India, and you

356
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,520
will have the same distribution rails as Tyler Hobbes says.

357
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Not the same branding, not the same promotion, that's different, right?

358
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,400
Not the same reputation, that's also different.

359
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,000
But before you didn't even have the distribution rails, right, you would have that 18 year

360
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,720
old kid in Andobot couldn't get into the gallery in London or in Soho or in Miami or

361
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Switzerland.

362
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,400
Right, but here they have the same rules.

363
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,920
And this model is now extensible once this happens, once this happens, to everything,

364
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,760
not just art, everything.

365
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:50,560
Everyone can have the same ability to buy, sell, trade, claims in the physical world,

366
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,360
instantly, globally with an air connection.

367
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,560
Arguably this, someday, will be a bigger deal of a native initial.

368
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,080
Quite a way in the future, I'll come back in a second, but arguably will be bigger because

369
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,960
this can represent everything, including the whole physical based economy, which is the

370
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,120
vast majority of the largest asset class in the space, in the world, by a lot, is real

371
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,120
estate, right?

372
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:26,000
So actually, in real estate, can come and owner or rented, and I'm just being renting

373
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,360
an apartment, hotels or rental, rental, right?

374
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:42,520
So once we can make efficient markets, if it sounds weird in the hotel space, think

375
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,680
about it for the real estate space.

376
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:52,560
Real estate is extremely sticky, a liquid high transaction cost, right?

377
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:02,720
Imagine if every apartment in Miami, you could put a bid, ask for, et cetera, and like, hey,

378
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,520
I need liquidity, I need to get out of my apartment now, right?

379
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,640
I need to be out now.

380
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,040
You put a low ask, right?

381
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,280
You put a low, by now price.

382
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,720
That will get sniped in a way that it won't happen in the current system, right?

383
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,800
And so, bringing markets, including secondary markets to all the world's physical goods

384
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:33,520
and services, is another one of these, like, give you huge ideas.

385
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:42,600
But unlike the native visual here, VTL, let's go to the next slide, there are challenges.

386
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:52,040
The reason NFTs took off first in native visual, the reason Fedensus took off, is because Fedensus

387
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:58,760
didn't need permission from anyone to mint the token and put the code in the token.

388
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,280
And that, to take the simple example, is not truly real estate.

389
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:12,880
A binding sale of real estate has a bunch of semi-now arcade paperwork that needs that.

390
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,880
And if you don't do that paperwork, you haven't actually bought the real estate.

391
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:27,280
And so, I cannot just spin up an NFT collection, say, hey, the SineFT represents my house.

392
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,680
And if you buy the SineFT, you now own my house, because you could go then go to the

393
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,960
title office and still going to have my name on it.

394
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,040
And for the title office to accept that the new owner has bought it, they're going to

395
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,440
want to see it as it varies by country.

396
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,680
But in many countries, it requires a physical signature, right?

397
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,360
And witnesses and all these things, right?

398
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,480
So, understandably, that house is important.

399
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,640
People don't want to lose their house for bad transaction.

400
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:03,240
And so, there's in many cases, a regulatory bridge is one of the things that keeps saying,

401
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
that needs to come in place.

402
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,200
Well, that coming place tomorrow for real estate is Congress working on allowing us

403
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,080
to trade NFTs representing houses now.

404
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:21,040
They're currently complaining if they want to shut down crypto or whatever wild ideas

405
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
they get, right?

406
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
But will this happen?

407
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,560
And yes, it will happen for the same reason that these signatures happen, right?

408
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,040
Eventually, we will be able to represent claims digitally.

409
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,400
They will be legally binding, and that will take care of the first bucket.

410
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,680
The second and third bucket are kind of the same, but, well, I separate them as follows.

411
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,200
And I'm going to ask too many about this.

412
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,880
Like, you know, how do I know the shirt that I own is the same shirt as the NFT, right?

413
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,400
How do you actually make that linkage?

414
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,320
The third is the counterpart of stuff, like how is it actually, how is the physical delivery,

415
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,480
the physical execution happen?

416
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,480
And generally, because of these things, the space is still quite immature.

417
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,240
I don't know what percent of the NFT market represents.

418
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,720
NFT is the physical component, but it's pretty small.

419
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,000
And the NFT market itself is very immature.

420
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,960
The NFT market is maybe a $10 billion market cap.

421
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,160
It's like, I don't know, 1% of crypto and crypto is still a very immature asset class, right?

422
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:33,680
So this is the immature end of the immature end of a fairly immature asset class.

423
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,880
But this also has the opposite perspective that this is why there's potentially a big

424
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
opportunity.

425
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,000
Once things are mature and working and they've spent decades, we in society have spent decades

426
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,680
getting them to work in a boring manner, there's usually less fewer business opportunities

427
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,280
because it's now quite efficient.

428
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,640
So anything you'd say here?

429
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,120
I think that this is pretty spot on.

430
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,440
You know, I've been experiencing a lot of these firsthand, right?

431
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,320
I think when you talk about legal frameworks of, first off, you have governments trying

432
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:16,200
to wrap their head around NFTs.

433
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,000
And now, as I think, my thesis is that NFTs will be coming into the real world and that

434
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,280
this tech will be coming into the real world.

435
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,840
And you do have to deal with the issues that you have highlighted here, right?

436
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,320
It's like, how do you associate the physical with the digital?

437
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,760
How do you handle shipping, insurance, damages?

438
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,520
How do you prove authenticity?

439
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:42,560
To me, these are all things that the space will have to deal with heads on, right?

440
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:47,960
And really deal with archaic laws that already exist, right?

441
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,600
And how you kind of retrofit that and create a framework for going forward, which I think

442
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,160
will be really interesting.

443
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,280
And to your point is where this is where a lot of the opportunity lies, right?

444
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,760
Because once people figure this out and once people understand exactly how these things

445
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,520
will be handled going forward, then a lot of those opportunities will then be gone by

446
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
them.

447
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
Agreed.

448
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:15,880
Let's see the next slide, NFT.

449
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,000
So this is a slide I use a lot.

450
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,760
And it's very conceptual, right?

451
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,880
Like there's not actual dates in there.

452
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,280
All the things on the left are the things that could be done natively digital or intangible

453
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
assets.

454
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,920
And intangible assets are big categories, post to $80 trillion category.

455
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,240
And all types of things can be in there and those can happen, I think, faster because

456
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,200
you don't have to solve these bridges in the physical world.

457
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,080
And then abstracted physical or tangible assets, which are services and goods.

458
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,440
I think services like come even faster than goods.

459
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,240
It's going to be less of a regulatory hurdle to sell a tailor-subtricate ticket than sell

460
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,360
your house, right?

461
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,160
And then ultimately, ultimately, the ultimate claim is governance in the physical world.

462
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,960
I think that will come too.

463
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,840
Now, I think we will see more of the ladder of the physical stuff in the second half

464
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:18,040
of the decade and digital as obviously started now and will continue.

465
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,000
It doesn't mean we have to wait until 2025.

466
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,400
This is, we have people like Jim and he doing it today.

467
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,800
But because of these specific topics that need to be solved, it will take longer to ramp

468
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
up.

469
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,400
So, I think these are my general topics.

470
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Let's go to 9DCC, which I think is a couple of slides forward.

471
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:51,360
And before we get into any sophisticated thoughts, tell us what it is.

472
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:59,400
Yeah, so at a really high level, 9DCC is a crypto-native luxury lifestyle brand.

473
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,320
And the reason why I felt like that there was a need for it is when I was going around

474
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:10,880
to conferences and I was going around and meeting people in real life, I quickly realized

475
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:18,120
that the same way that I can signal that I'm a crypto-native with my crypto-punk, and

476
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:24,720
that was my thesis for buying my ape when I did was this is a flex, this is a signal

477
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,400
that I am sending to my peers in a digital world.

478
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,320
Nothing like that existed to the way that I wanted it, in terms of an aesthetic that

479
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,440
I wanted to wear, that I could signal to the real world that I'm a crypto-native and having

480
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,840
the quality of product that I wanted to wear in terms of production.

481
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,720
You know, just generally like things that I would wear, it just didn't exist.

482
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,080
And so rather than wait for somebody else to go out and build it, I decided to do it

483
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,840
on my own.

484
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,800
So let me put it back in my words.

485
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,840
Obviously there's all types of quote unquote flexes in the physical world in terms of existing

486
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:16,800
physical products, but you from an aesthetic or messaging perspective, they're not crypto-native,

487
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,800
right?

488
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,320
Like there's existing luxury brands are not crypto-native.

489
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,800
So yeah, so I felt like that there was this kind of like if you had like these two subsets,

490
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
right?

491
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,240
It's like, you know, you could, I could walk into a Dior store and I could buy a shirt

492
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,360
off the rack and I could wear that out.

493
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,760
And that would obviously be of the quality that I wanted.

494
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
But that wouldn't signal that I was a crypto native.

495
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,120
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, I feel like there was a lot of product from

496
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,320
the crypto world that, okay, I can signal that I'm a crypto native with it, but it wasn't

497
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,240
necessarily the quality or the community that I would necessarily want to be a part of.

498
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,080
And so I feel like there will be this growing intersection of the overlap of those two communities

499
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
over time.

500
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:09,200
I'm going to take a step back here because you very famously were one of the first people,

501
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,680
maybe the first person to pay an awful lot of money for a crypto book for your ape.

502
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,920
And I think that kind of snowballed the big rally in crypto punks.

503
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,480
Tell us a little bit about the logic because you said it was like that logic.

504
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,200
So let's tell the group that logic.

505
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,400
How do this all start?

506
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Yeah.

507
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:43,440
So, you know, I, when I found NFTs, it was August of 2020, and they like almost immediately

508
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,520
made sense to me because I started playing Fortnite at the beginning of quarantine.

509
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,960
And that was back in March of 2020.

510
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:54,240
And when I was playing with all these kids, you know, teenagers, the first thing that they

511
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
would ask me is, you know, what skins did you buy?

512
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,040
And skins that they don't give you any special powers.

513
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,400
The only thing they do is change how you look while you play that game.

514
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,400
And these kids would be changing their skins every, you know, 10 to 20 minutes, depending

515
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,240
on how long the game was.

516
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,760
And I was, I said to myself, like, there's this massive super cycle here where that kid

517
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,680
is 12 years old today, 10 years from now, he'll be 22 and he'll have his own disposable

518
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,720
income and he'll be totally okay with owning a purely digital asset.

519
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:29,320
Now at the time, I had no idea what NFTs were, but it was an idea that stuck with me.

520
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:34,600
And when I found NFTs, I was like, wow, this is your skin on Twitter, right?

521
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,520
Like this is literally, you know, the same way that if I got a limited edition skin that

522
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,720
now trades on eBay at a premium, this type of thing would happen.

523
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,360
And to your point is, there is a secondary marketplace that exists for, you know, the

524
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,880
value of this thing to be found on in a free market.

525
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,400
And so I started delving down the crypto rabbit hole, the NFT rabbit hole, because I was already

526
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,080
in crypto.

527
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:07,800
And I saw crypto punks and I think the floor was maybe around $1,000 at the time, but

528
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,160
I said, oh, these are too expensive.

529
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,800
I want to find the next crypto punks.

530
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,960
And I ended up minting a bunch of chromisquiggles and, you know, snow fro and a few other OGs

531
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,320
where, you know, they told me, what are you doing?

532
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,280
Like, you know, you should be buying a crypto punk.

533
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:27,480
You should buy a zombie or what, you know, or something like a big, a rare one, a super

534
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
rare one.

535
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,960
And, you know, I started spending some time really researching it.

536
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,720
And that's kind of where I developed my thesis, which is my, my pin tweet in my Twitter,

537
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,360
where, you know, humans are, you know, social creatures, right?

538
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,680
And even though the technology of how we interact with each other will change, but the one

539
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,160
thing that doesn't change is, you know, the way we signal to each other, the way we interact

540
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,160
with each other.

541
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,440
And like a really simple example that I always use is, you know, if we were to meet for dinner

542
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,760
6529 and we were to sit down and I were to show you my bank account, like that, like,

543
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,560
that would be weird, right?

544
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,760
That's just not how humans like interact with each other.

545
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,880
But I could almost send a very similar signal by wearing a nice watch, by driving a nice

546
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,600
car, by wearing nice clothes that, oh, you know, you don't know exactly how much is my

547
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,840
bank account.

548
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,920
But judging by the nature of the things that I am wearing or consuming, you can have a

549
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,840
good idea of like, oh, if this person is doing X, then, you know, it probably signals Y.

550
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,400
And that's just the way humans operate because that's, you know, that and that's been since

551
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
the dawn of time.

552
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,040
And it's not just humans, right?

553
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:48,040
It is other animals that do certain things or have certain behavior patterns.

554
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,640
That is, let's say, for mating or for social hierarchy within their groups.

555
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:58,960
And so my thesis very quickly became that, okay, the same way that me wearing a Rolex

556
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,400
to a nice dinner allows me to send a signal in that smaller group.

557
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,320
Me spending a certain amount of money that's verifiable on chain for a picture also sends

558
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:15,280
that signal of one, you know, what part of the community am I a part of?

559
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,200
But then two is also it's a verifiable signal that has a ton of scale, right?

560
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,880
So when I drive a Lamborghini through my neighborhood, then maybe only like 10 to 50 people see

561
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,160
it that day.

562
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:32,760
But if I buy something that's worth the same amount as that Lamborghini and I make it my

563
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,040
profile picture, then that scales to thousands, if not millions of people with the same, with

564
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,480
the same exact outlay.

565
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,760
And so that was like my original thesis for CryptoPunks and the ape.

566
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:50,120
And you know, it just, it was, to me, it's like it's signaled after spending, you know,

567
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:54,360
some time in the space in the NFT space, it's signaled what I thought would be maybe the

568
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:59,080
most crypto native OG community in the NFT space.

569
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,200
And so for that reason, people would want to be associated over time and it would hold

570
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,920
that provenance and it would hold that upper echelon within the community, even, you know,

571
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,920
through in into bear markets and bull markets.

572
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Got it.

573
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,440
And then I think a big part of that turned out to be turned out to be right.

574
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:28,520
And then you're now saying, okay, when I'm interacting with my crypto community in real

575
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,840
life, how to represent these same things.

576
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,360
And that's a lot of, let me ask you, you're saying, is this somehow different?

577
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:42,560
And how is it different that you say, well, look, I'm making nice clothes.

578
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,080
What's different about that?

579
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,920
I think that there are a few things.

580
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,280
I think one is I'm integrating the technology into it, right?

581
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,720
But also it's like, you know, what does it stand for?

582
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
Right?

583
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,500
Because like I said, there is no, like I could wear a board eight on my shirt, but that's

584
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,680
just generally not an aesthetic that I would want to wear.

585
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,680
And I think like for me, like the aesthetic that I created with 90 CC is something that

586
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,160
I would be interested in wearing.

587
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,200
I hope others would be interested in wearing.

588
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:17,120
I think it's a level of quality of, you know, I've been to a lot of crypto conferences.

589
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,800
I mean, people spend a lot of money on clothes.

590
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,680
People spend a lot of money on how they look.

591
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,160
And so, but the problem is is that there's no way to signal that you're a crypto native.

592
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,680
So I think that that was, that was the first pillar that I wanted to solve.

593
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,360
But then like where I think things get really interesting is, you know, kind of what's mentioned

594
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:37,920
on this slide here is where, you know, you can have a certificate of authenticity that

595
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,000
travels with the physical product, right?

596
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,360
And when you look at watches, right, I think watches are a great example where if you buy

597
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:49,760
a watch with paperwork, it's worth significantly more than a watch without paperwork, right?

598
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,840
So, you know, there, there is a good, a good proof case that there is a significant amount

599
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,600
of value placed on that certificate of authenticity.

600
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:04,240
And the more interlinked that you can make that certificate of authenticity with the

601
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,600
actual product, then the less risk there is of that thing being a fake, right?

602
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,800
You know, secondhand goods, secondhand luxury goods is a massive business and it's growing.

603
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,600
Like fake goods that are made is a massive business and it's still growing.

604
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,720
And so all of these things that there's, there is a lot of need for this, but there isn't

605
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,400
necessarily a solution out there that works at scale.

606
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,520
Because when you want to make, if you were to buy a product secondhand, you need to take

607
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,320
it to an expert that could still doesn't guarantee that it's actually real, right?

608
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:42,660
Because every, each and every day, fakes are getting better and better in terms of quality.

609
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,960
So that somebody that might have caught a fake, you know, three to five years ago might not

610
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,800
be able to catch that fake today.

611
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,840
So what better way than to have a certificate of authenticity that is provable on a decentralized

612
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,800
ledger by just scanning the shirt instead of, let's say, having to increase that cost

613
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,240
of transaction by having to go to an expert to verify that it's real.

614
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:08,160
And even then that verification doesn't necessarily guarantee that it's real.

615
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:11,640
So you said there's the tech.

616
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,560
How does that work?

617
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,160
So it's really simple.

618
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,560
So on all of our iteration one and iteration two shirts, you can see in the patch where

619
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,800
the nine is on both those shirts and those pictures, there's an NFC chip behind that

620
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,960
patch, which you can then scan.

621
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:36,400
And it takes you to a page that shows you the NFT that represents that shirt on the blockchain.

622
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,760
And that it is held in that owner's wallet.

623
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:43,800
So there's a little chip embedded in the shirt.

624
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:44,800
Yeah.

625
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,800
What?

626
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,800
Yes.

627
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,800
And you can longer it with a wash it.

628
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Yeah.

629
00:45:51,800 --> 00:46:03,240
And this and the NFT, if I go now and just buy one of these NFTs online.

630
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,960
So where's the shirt?

631
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,080
How do I get it?

632
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:11,640
So the way we did the drop mechanic was we partnered with 4K, which is a centralized

633
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:18,240
custodian, to your point that you were saying earlier, right, is what I found that, you know,

634
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,200
when you take a look at, you know, sneaker culture and you take a look at the resale

635
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,760
market, a lot of people will buy more than one product, right?

636
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,960
So you'll buy like people always say, one to one to cop and one to one to rock and one

637
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,040
to cop.

638
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,960
And so what ends up happening is people will store a pair of sneakers in their closet

639
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,560
and they will never wear them.

640
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:45,880
And that stays stored in their closet until they dig the day they go to sell it.

641
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:50,520
And so my thought process is if I'm only going to be storing it in my closet and the

642
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:54,040
only time I'm going to touch it is when I actually go to sell it, there's technically

643
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,000
no reason for me to take delivery.

644
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,160
Much the same way that stocks work, right, is like you don't physically take delivery

645
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,200
of the shares when you buy and sell it.

646
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:08,400
You have a claim on those shares that is managed by a central database that will tell you that

647
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,680
runs their own ledger that tells you you buy or you own or you buy or sell an asset.

648
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,560
And so what we did is we partnered with 4K, so when we made all of the shirts, we delivered

649
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:26,720
them to 4K and 4K then issued an NFT voucher which represents that T-shirt in their warehouse.

650
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,280
And we can go around and you can trade that a thousand times.

651
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:35,240
And then at any given point in time, whoever owns that voucher can then go to 4K and claim

652
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,520
that shirt and get it delivered to them anywhere in the world within three to five days, which

653
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:50,160
I think is an insanely amazing feat considering where we are with the resale of goods today

654
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,400
where it happens on eBay, it happens on StockX, the cost of transactions is way higher because

655
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,120
you have to verify things that might be in the condition that might not be in the condition

656
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:07,400
that they're supposed to be in, but then also the length of time that it takes to verify

657
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,480
that something is real, to get it sent from the seller, to the authenticator, to the buyer,

658
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
just like there's a lot of friction there.

659
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,420
And I feel like by placing these assets in a centralized custodian that to your point

660
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,840
is can verify the condition that they're in and can verify delivery and that there's

661
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:33,360
actually an actual physical product there, you then make the friction much lower, right?

662
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,240
And you increase this ability for people to conduct commerce on a much global scale.

663
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:50,640
And does 4K charge the, let's say I buy the NFT, now I have a claim on a shirt at 4K,

664
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,080
do I have to pay annual storage?

665
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,160
How does it work?

666
00:48:54,160 --> 00:49:00,080
So the way we work the first shop, the first shop has free lifetime storage, the second

667
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:05,640
shop has free storage for two years, free storage and insurance for two years.

668
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,880
And then afterwards, I believe the fee might be like around $2 a year, per sure.

669
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,440
I don't know the exact thoughts off my head, but it very much would work in terms of like

670
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,640
if anybody sees, and this is like long term, but if anybody has seen storage wars where

671
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:28,720
somebody were to default on like their storage fees at some point, then they obviously forfeit

672
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,520
the asset that's held in the warehouse and then it would go to auction.

673
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,520
Right.

674
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:43,080
And then if, so I can trade and then the person who buys it knows the shirt bagging it, if

675
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,640
I redeem the shirt, does my NFT change from like a mid pass NFT to a kind of ownership

676
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
NFT?

677
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
Yeah.

678
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:57,760
So what ends up happening is when you claim the shirt, you burn your NFT, which is basically

679
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,720
a bearer instrument for that shirt in their warehouse.

680
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,400
They ship you the shirt.

681
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,560
When you get this fit, when you get the physical shirt, you unpack it, you then scan the tag

682
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:14,120
and then you can pull the NFT into your wallet, which acts as the certificate of authenticity.

683
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:20,280
So like for me, like one of the things that I had a really tough time wrapping my head

684
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:24,920
around and you know, when I when I met the team in IYK, it made the most sense to me

685
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:30,040
where up until that point, all the solutions that I had seen linking the physical product

686
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:35,840
to the digital NFT didn't scale because it works great on the primary sale, right?

687
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,920
It works great if you are the first person to buy the product for me.

688
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,880
I ship you the shirt and I ship you the NFT.

689
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,680
But now what happens if you want to turn around and you want to sell it to somebody else,

690
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,760
right?

691
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,200
It doesn't scale because if you were to if you were to give them that shirt and somebody

692
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,920
were to give you cash, then you need to go home and send them that NFT.

693
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,520
Now as soon as you have that cash, you are no longer incentivized to send them that NFT.

694
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,440
You'll get to it when you get to it.

695
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,000
But by by by and that's a push mechanism, right?

696
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:12,200
By using the pull mechanism, which IYK, you know, originally were the first people that

697
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,440
spoke to me about it.

698
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,360
I thought it was genius in the sense that whoever has physical possession of the shirt

699
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:23,480
can then pull that NFT, that certificate of authenticity into their wallet.

700
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,760
So you know, when they say possession is nine tenths of the law, you know, that that rings

701
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,600
really true in the sense that yes, you have that physical certificate of authenticity

702
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,480
that travels with the actual shirts so that in that interaction that I just told you about,

703
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,080
then as soon as you get your money, then the transaction is over.

704
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,880
That person can then pull that certificate of authenticity into their wallet whenever they

705
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,880
want.

706
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:54,560
So basically it's a custom contract that IYK runs.

707
00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:01,440
And if you scan the physical, whoever has access to the physical good can pull the virtual

708
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,440
day.

709
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:03,440
Yes.

710
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,960
It's really interesting.

711
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,360
And like the thing that I really liked about it was that it was just nobody else had really

712
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:14,840
come up with that solution at the time.

713
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,440
This was, you know, over a year ago at this point.

714
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,120
And I was like, wow, that to me is something that's super scalable, right?

715
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,440
That because again, going back to the watch example where, you know, you have, you can

716
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:32,800
make an argument that the paperwork that certificate of authenticity is equally as valuable if

717
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,520
not maybe more valuable than the actual watch itself, right?

718
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,800
Because that's the proof that this is real.

719
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Right.

720
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:54,520
And even though, and people can't, can they copy that?

721
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:55,520
The NFT?

722
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,640
The code is scanned.

723
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,680
No, because the code is like it's locked into the chip.

724
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,880
So, you know, if you like, if you wanted to, let's say, make a fake, right?

725
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,880
It ultimately wouldn't have, you know, you wouldn't be able to claim the actual NFT fraud

726
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,880
that originally comes from the 90 CC wallet.

727
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,600
You know, when you talk about provenance and we obviously talk about this with artists all

728
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,600
the time.

729
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,560
And the reason why I named the brand 90 CC is that is the wallet that is the proof, the

730
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,920
provenance, right?

731
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,760
All our NFTs come from there.

732
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,080
Come from that wallet.

733
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:36,320
So then you can chain, you can, you can track that chain of history, right?

734
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:40,480
Where it's like, it will come if you bought a shirt, you bought it from 90 CC.

735
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,640
It goes from 90 CC's wallet to 6529's wallet to whoever other wallet who buys it there

736
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:46,880
after you.

737
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,840
And that to me becomes super important, right?

738
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,240
So it's like, if somebody were to make a fake, they could, they can make a fake of everything,

739
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,640
except for the actual NFT that can then be pulled into the wallet.

740
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,960
So when you talk about, you know, verifying authenticity, all of a sudden, instead of

741
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,760
having to go to an authenticator to make something as real, it literally just comes down to

742
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,200
something as simple as a scam.

743
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,400
Very interesting.

744
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,400
Okay.

745
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,760
So what, what have been the challenges?

746
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,920
I'll say the challenges have been like dealing with the meat space, right?

747
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:28,360
dealing with all the things that that you were talking about in terms of, you know, regulation,

748
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:35,120
shipping, taxes, all these things that there isn't enough regulatory clarity around things

749
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,280
yet.

750
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,480
And we're trying to navigate things the best that we can.

751
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,760
While also like, you know, trying to operate at the forefront of technology of, you know,

752
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,480
a lot of this comes from these are things that I just want to see in the world as a consumer,

753
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:51,480
right?

754
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,840
If I'm spending hundreds, if not thousands of dollars on something that's expensive,

755
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:01,800
I would like to know like, verifiably, how many of them exist, right?

756
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,400
Like, I think this, this always happens, I think with a lot of the luxury goods markets

757
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,040
is where people like, you know, you'll ask is like, how many of these exist?

758
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:13,320
And they give you a number, but like, you can't necessarily verify that.

759
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,080
Like, they could be over producing or under producing.

760
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:23,240
And, you know, really relying on the customer's trust, but it's like, why shouldn't it exist

761
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:27,920
in a way so that people understand exactly how many of them exist in the real world?

762
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,600
Because that also affects long-term value as well, right?

763
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:35,560
Of like, you know, like t-shirts are going to be naturally deflationary, right?

764
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,680
In terms of, you know, there's wear and tear over time.

765
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:40,560
There's as soon as you wear one, right?

766
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,640
It's worth, it's worth a different amount than a brand new, never worn shirt.

767
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,600
So I think that will affect, it's going to be really interesting to watch this play out

768
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:49,720
long-term.

769
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:55,360
But I'll say like a lot of the, a lot of the stuff has been in terms of delivering quickly,

770
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,360
right?

771
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,120
Having an idea where, you know, in a digital space, I can have an idea and I can execute

772
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:04,680
it relatively quickly because there's no physical manufacturing component.

773
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:09,160
But I think when you start getting into the manufacturing of things and the physicality

774
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,920
of things, things start to get much more complicated, right?

775
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,720
And so I'll use like our second drop, which was iteration two, which we did with Snowfro.

776
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,080
It was the collaboration with Snowfro.

777
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,800
It was in our Basel.

778
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:29,120
And what we did was we made generative clothes on demand for, you know, five days at a pop-up.

779
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,920
So people would come in, they didn't need to have crypto, they can come in, they could

780
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,400
swipe a credit card.

781
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,600
They would mint an NFT, which was a squiggle variant.

782
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:44,520
So it was the same exact algorithm that Snowfro used to generate the chromiswiggle.

783
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,680
But instead of a squiggly line output, it's a straight line output with the 90cc logo

784
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,760
above.

785
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,640
As soon as that got minted onto the blockchain, we then printed that onto a T-shirt.

786
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:00,120
We then linked that NFT that the person just minted to the physical shirt so that it travels

787
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,360
with the shirt.

788
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,840
And then we boxed it up and handed it to the customer within 10 minutes.

789
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:10,520
And so to me, the technical feed of that was amazing.

790
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:16,240
The fact that we were able to pull that off, there was about 41 hours over the course of

791
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,600
five days that we were up and we were only down for 12 minutes.

792
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:27,080
And so the fact that we were able to do that, there's a lot of operational intricacies that

793
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,280
end up going into that.

794
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:34,800
But I think when I look into the future of the same way that we all want very personal

795
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:40,400
lines, digital products to represent who we are, I think we, as the manufacturing process

796
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,920
is catch up to the human imagination, we're going to start seeing a need and a desire

797
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:52,480
for personalization, mass personalization within the physical space as well.

798
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:58,920
So Snowfro was on the course earlier in the fall.

799
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,600
And that's one of his big ideas also, right?

800
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:08,000
We will see mass personalization, mass customization in physical goods as well.

801
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,920
And it's one of the things he hopes to be working on with Artbox.

802
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:24,240
So logically, all kind of luxury brands at least are going to want to do something like

803
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,240
what you're doing, right?

804
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:32,320
And it improves their ability to say, this is the real one and someone else goes and

805
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,520
buys it on Canal Street.

806
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,000
It's not quite the same thing, right?

807
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Exactly.

808
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,640
And I think one, you know, that from low hanging fruit is that certificate of authenticity.

809
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,520
But then also to the point you just made is, you know, mass customization of, you know,

810
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:55,160
how cool would it be if, you know, you walk into a Louis Vuitton store.

811
00:58:55,160 --> 00:59:00,000
You pick out your favorite purse and you get that personalized more so than just maybe

812
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,160
having like your initials monogrammed on it, right?

813
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,120
You can have like your favorite prints or your favorite artist or, you know, whatever

814
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,640
have you kind of be printed onto it.

815
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,120
And so you get that element of personalization.

816
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,640
And I think that that's where the world is headed.

817
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,920
I think just at this moment, again, we're just held back by the manufacturing process

818
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,600
of how you can do something like this at scale because over the last, you know, hundreds

819
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,720
of 150 years, you know, it's been the exact opposite where it's like, how do you get the

820
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,240
lowest price product of making, you know, a hundred million of the same things for the

821
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,240
lowest cost?

822
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,320
Now, I think we're going to be running into the problem of trying to figure out how do

823
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:44,520
you make a hundred million unique individual things for the lowest cost?

824
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:55,680
And is there a way, and I'm not saying today, but somehow that the authenticity would be

825
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,720
visible in the physical world, obviously not going to go around scanning people's, I mean,

826
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:05,120
be weird if I came and grabbed your tag and like, I had to scan your edit of seat ship,

827
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,120
right?

828
01:00:06,120 --> 01:00:10,600
But like, is there a way where that does sort of happen in like AR or something?

829
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:14,200
I mean, I could see that possibly happening with AR, right?

830
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:20,840
So in a world where we're all wearing like Google or Apple glasses, or AR glasses, where

831
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,840
you know, it could say, you know, like verified real almost like, think of it maybe like a

832
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,800
verified collection on OpenSea, right?

833
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:34,000
And I don't know like the exact capabilities of what that tech would look like, but I could

834
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,240
definitely see a world where that ends up happening.

835
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:43,760
And you know, like, I think it will lower the amount of fakes out there, right?

836
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,600
Because there's that like social and public shame of people, if people find out that,

837
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:53,680
you know, you have a fake Rolex or whatever it is, I think it's going to be interesting

838
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,160
to watch the dynamic play out in real time.

839
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,480
But I do, I do foresee a world where that can happen.

840
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:09,560
I mean, if there was some world where it's the same world where if you are demonstrating

841
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,200
what's in your wallet, right?

842
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:19,560
If you can, the same world where you can show that you own your punk in the physical world

843
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,480
is the same world you can do this because all you need to do is show the NFT, right?

844
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,280
We don't need to touch, we don't need to touch your shirt.

845
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,760
That could be kind of awkward, right?

846
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,200
If you have the NFT, then you have the NFT for this in the same way that if you have

847
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,560
a punk, you can show a punk.

848
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,680
So if you have some type of augmented reality glasses, which are going to happen, right?

849
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:57,280
And if people are somehow signing with their device, I guess their wallet, right?

850
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:03,480
Their public addresses are wallet, then maybe you could do it that way, right?

851
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,920
You could imagine happening about that.

852
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,360
Yeah, I mean, I could definitely see that where you can showcase the collection that

853
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:12,000
you want people to see, right?

854
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:18,600
So if you go to a nightclub, maybe you probably showcase a different collection than if you

855
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,200
were to go to get coffee at Starbucks, right?

856
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,280
Yeah, really interesting.

857
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:34,680
I mean, I can see how this could be appealing to obviously crypto native fashion companies

858
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:40,400
like yours, but lifestyle or whatever the right word is, but how it could be interesting

859
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:47,200
on the traditional providers who have a large problem with counterfeit, right?

860
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:53,280
Yeah, I believe it was, I think, $80 billion last year and expected to grow.

861
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,840
I think maybe double digits to share.

862
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:03,680
What else are you seeing out there that you think is super interesting, challenging?

863
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:10,760
What's the future of 9DCC?

864
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,120
Where do we go next?

865
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:16,880
You know, I think to me, the most compelling part of everything that we've done over the

866
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:22,080
last six to seven months has been the gamification of IRL.

867
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:29,200
And you don't want people coming up to you and randomly scanning your tag, but I think

868
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:35,600
what we saw in our Basel was that people do enjoy that and people do like to connect,

869
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:36,600
right?

870
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:42,440
Because, and I noticed this really early on after the lockdowns ended, is that we were

871
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:47,760
making all these connections online, but people want to connect in real life.

872
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,120
And I can make an argument that probably the biggest utility of NFTs is connecting in real

873
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,400
life as people make these friends in Discord.

874
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,840
And then when they go to a conference, they want to meet up in real life and have a meet

875
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,720
up for their communities.

876
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:09,320
And so, and this was really born from the idea that I ran a POOP event in June of 2021,

877
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:15,080
where I tweeted out, you know, show up to this place, and this is during BTC Miami.

878
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,000
And I tweeted out, show up to this place and, you know, collect the POOP, the person wearing

879
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,520
the G Money shirt.

880
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:24,760
And about 80 people showed up over the course of three days.

881
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:29,200
One of those days, there were two guys that met up that didn't have anything in common

882
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:33,920
other than the fact that they both followed me and they both showed up to the same coffee

883
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,080
shop at the same time to collect the POOP.

884
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:43,320
They ended up starting a venture fund together and they ended up co-founding a few dows together.

885
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:48,680
And I think about that a lot because these are two people that otherwise would not have

886
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:52,320
met if it wasn't for me sending out that tweet.

887
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:57,960
And as I think about, how can I then increase these interactions to happen at scale so that

888
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:01,280
I don't need to be that center spoke for people to connect.

889
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:05,920
But I can rather create this network where each individual person in that network could

890
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,080
basically become their own node and create their network around them, which will grow

891
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,760
the entire network.

892
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:18,120
So what we ended up doing and for anybody that ever sees a 90cc shirt out in the wild,

893
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:23,640
you can go up to that shirt and you can collect the POOP because each shirt distributes its

894
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,040
own individual POOP.

895
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,080
So it is proof that you met that physical shirt.

896
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:37,360
And what we did with our Basel is we ran two contests concurrently where there was a leaderboard

897
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,640
for the people, for the person that would collect the most POOPs from unique individual

898
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,640
shirts.

899
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:46,200
And there was also another leaderboard for the person that distributed the most POOPs.

900
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:48,600
And this was run over the course of five days.

901
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:53,200
We distributed close to 5,000 POOPs over the course of five days.

902
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:57,880
And this was all people running around Miami making connections.

903
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:03,160
I had a lot of people reach out to me saying how it was an amazing icebreaker, right?

904
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,440
Because a lot of times, even if you see somebody wearing a shirt that you like, a lot of times

905
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:12,320
the conversation is, hey, I like your shirt, thanks.

906
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,280
And the conversation ends there.

907
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,000
But I think as humans, we crave that connection, right?

908
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,760
We want to connect with people.

909
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:27,200
And so what collecting a POOP allows is a lot, it allows that icebreaker to happen in a very

910
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,200
authentic way, right?

911
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,760
Where it's like, oh, hey, like, you know, you see somebody wearing the shirt, you collect

912
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:37,120
their POOP, maybe, you know, it takes, you know, five to 15 seconds to actually go through

913
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,280
the process.

914
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,520
And in that time, you start talking to the person and it's like, oh, where are you from?

915
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:42,520
What do you do?

916
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:43,520
What are you into?

917
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,240
Maybe a new friendship forms, maybe a new business relationship forms.

918
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,240
Who knows?

919
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,600
The possibilities are endless.

920
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,240
But I do think that like by being able to gamify these connections that are we seeing

921
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:59,760
in Discord, in Twitter, like in a digital space and bringing that out into the real world,

922
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,120
I think that that's where like the real secret sauce is.

923
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,400
And that's what gets me the most excited about what we're doing.

924
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,400
Okay.

925
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,440
Very interesting.

926
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:20,880
What are the things that we should have discussed about 9DCC or the challenges opportunity setup

927
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,680
future that we haven't discussed yet, that we should cover?

928
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:29,400
I think, you know, we, I think overall through the entire presentation, we've been discussing

929
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:33,520
it, but I want to really lean into like the composability of it, right?

930
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:38,480
Which is really like what makes crypto so powerful is composability, right?

931
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,200
And everything that we've been talking about, and I think the hotel room example that you

932
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:49,080
use is a great example of it is like when you can take, you know, non-fungible slash

933
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:55,720
semi-fungible assets and make them as composable as possible, what, you know, how valuable does

934
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,080
that become, right?

935
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:01,400
And so I'll use the t-shirt says an example, but you can also technically use it against

936
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,480
like hotel inventory, right?

937
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:09,120
Of being able to then post that as collateral in an NFT lending platform and take out a

938
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,120
loan against it.

939
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,840
Like, I think I probably took out the first on-chain loan against a t-shirt about two

940
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,280
months ago, where I posted as collateral.

941
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:21,440
I had somebody that was willing to lend me money against it.

942
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:28,920
And now people that own a 9DCC shirt can then post it as collateral and get a $125 loan

943
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,520
almost instantaneously by posting as collateral.

944
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:38,640
And I think that these value unlocks that start to happen in markets that are very immature

945
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,240
that don't have access to this type of capital, right?

946
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:45,000
Because what I'm describing is a margin loan against a stock.

947
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,880
It is a mortgage against a piece of real estate.

948
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:53,160
It's nothing that's very esoteric or complex in the traditional finance world, but you're

949
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:58,000
going to open up these markets and give people access to this capital that otherwise might

950
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,200
not have had it.

951
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,080
And that all really comes from composability.

952
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:06,560
Very interesting.

953
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,800
Let's go see the other slides.

954
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,640
There's some examples and I think one of them is your partner, so we can actually, I want

955
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,360
to get your views on them.

956
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,000
I think they're in some of the slides.

957
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:24,640
So, Materiam, this has been going on, they've been working on this for a while and it's

958
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:30,740
not the case, but my understanding and we might next running of the course get the founder

959
01:09:30,740 --> 01:09:36,720
Vini to talk to him about it.

960
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:39,920
The general, I'm going to summarize it, it might be wrong.

961
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,880
But like my general views they spend a lot of time thinking about the contractual aspects.

962
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:52,720
I don't think they worry so much about the gamification, or there are mental levels, how

963
01:09:52,720 --> 01:10:02,640
make sure that the sales of these assets in ABCD jurisdictions are legally binding and

964
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:09,520
have a legally binding contract that people can use. Do you have a different sense of

965
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:15,280
how they think about it? I think that's the way they think about it. I spoke to Vinay

966
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:22,000
I think almost two years ago at this point but from my understanding he was thinking about it

967
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:30,320
at more of the contractual level and how you can maybe sell a piece of real estate on chain

968
01:10:30,320 --> 01:10:36,560
between a counterparty in let's say Europe and the United States and dealing with the laws

969
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,960
and how that works. So I think he's thinking at a very high level in terms of that.

970
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:46,240
Yeah we need to get him on in the spring and talk to him. He's very interesting.

971
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:54,240
I follow him on Twitter he's very interesting so it'll be good to get his views. What's the next one

972
01:10:54,240 --> 01:11:00,560
VT? All right so 4k I think you should present the slide in

973
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:08,320
Talisman 4k since you're an actual customer 4k. Yep I mean I love the product. I had

974
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:16,320
I originally wanted to make create a centralized custodian back in I think it was December of 2020

975
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:24,080
where I remember when Nifty Gateway did the the beable drop and there was I think it was like

976
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:28,480
an eight-week trading window where you can trade the digital asset and then there was like a six-week

977
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:33,920
claim window where you can claim the physical the physical piece that came with the drop.

978
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,960
And I remember reaching out to somebody on the customer support staff I'm like well

979
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:45,040
you're gonna you're gonna crush the trading like one-step physical window is done because

980
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,240
I know there's gonna be more value I think long-term in keeping the digital and the physical

981
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:56,160
component combined. I think we saw a lot of people over the last like you know two years really

982
01:11:56,160 --> 01:12:01,200
disconnect that because people didn't necessarily care about the physical component but I do think

983
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:06,160
long-term people are gonna want both of those together. So I really early on I was like there's

984
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:12,400
going to be a need for this centralized custodian much the same way that free ports exist in that

985
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:18,240
yeah I'm gonna I'm in a whole this physical asset someplace because I don't need to take possession

986
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:25,040
of it but I do want to have the access to a 24-7 global marketplace and at the time

987
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,800
like I spoke to a few lawyers and nobody had any idea what an NFT was and when I explained the

988
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:38,240
contract it really was I feel they they didn't I think they didn't totally understand it and I

989
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:42,880
spoke to a few people and it seemed like there would be enough legal risk that I didn't necessarily

990
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:49,680
want to do it as a US citizen living in US jurisdiction but I said I will like if I find the

991
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:55,520
founder that wants to do this this is like I think this would be a massive business I was introduced

992
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:03,680
to to Richard maybe like maybe a year ago or yeah maybe a year ago a year and a half ago and I

993
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:09,200
mean I loved it obviously because I had that idea organically myself as well and I saw that he was

994
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,640
already doing it and so you know we spent a lot of time talking and what I think is really interesting

995
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:20,800
and I had him on my podcast a few months ago was being able to bring like a lot of different

996
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:25,920
um ask real-world assets on chain like he even said like the possibility of bringing like

997
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:31,840
like the caretaking of an animal on chain and I think he has to figure out the logistics of that

998
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,880
but I'm like ultimately the world where it's like you know like um those like you know take you

999
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:42,320
know pay a dollar a day to like feed like a monkey or something like you could technically run

1000
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:49,040
something like that off the 4k protocol which I think becomes like very interesting um and like

1001
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:54,240
I don't know the legality of the complexities of that but at the very least right is like you can

1002
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:59,360
take you know something like a Rolex watch something like I have some sneakers that are custody there

1003
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:05,280
I have 90 cc shirts that are custody there but then also by building out on the protocol layer

1004
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,360
then other people can create also their own storage on top of that right so it's like if I have an

1005
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:19,680
empty warehouse here in my backyard I can then take custody and um verify that let's say that Rolex

1006
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:25,600
is real and that it's stored in a location in a safe location uh and be part of that 4k network

1007
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,280
that ultimately starts originally with their protocol but then builds out globally and like

1008
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:36,160
what does that mean for the implications is that network builds out so I I think that there's like

1009
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:41,520
a lot of really cool stuff that that can be done with this right and what I'm I'm really interested

1010
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:47,200
about on the uh on the composability layer is now being able to take that real world asset

1011
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:52,640
and then use it as collateral for other things right and I think this is where

1012
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:59,280
when you have that zero to one moment where I think it's going to be very difficult there's

1013
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,040
going to be a harder time bringing real estate on chain then there will be bringing watches on

1014
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:12,080
chain or sneakers on chain because financing mechanisms for those two industries that I just

1015
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:19,520
said don't exist on a global scale yet whereas you know getting a mortgage for real estate is like

1016
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,040
it's a massively global business that already has its processes flow and place and it already has

1017
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,760
you know its industry and its people with vested interests whereas if you're able to take something

1018
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:36,240
from zero to one and provide capital and provide access to capital and financing that a market

1019
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:40,880
might not already have I think you're going to see faster adoption than you will you know I

1020
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:46,320
firmly believe real estate comes on chain I just think it will take much longer because there's

1021
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:55,280
already a mature industry around it makes perfect sense what's the next let's go to the next slide

1022
01:15:55,280 --> 01:16:07,120
do you know about corn lord I do I'm I angel invested into it they're very similar to 4k right they do

1023
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:14,480
physical custody of assets and issue you in nft they've teamed up with with brinks as their

1024
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:21,600
vaulting partner so you know they've had a few drops I believe their first drops might have been

1025
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:29,680
on polygon I'm not exactly sure I think they were on on an L2 to start but I'm not sure where they're

1026
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:42,640
they're currently issuing their nft's okay and what do we have next and then I'm Ericana I think

1027
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:50,640
it's trying to be the open sea for physically backed nft's right is that are you are you very familiar

1028
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:58,640
with them I'm not very familiar with them I know that they're chipping products and creating I think

1029
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:03,600
a marketplace for those products I haven't I haven't had the opportunity to chat with their team

1030
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:14,320
very closely just like you know in passing at you know at like a cocktail hour or something

1031
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:23,120
okay do we have anything else let's see do you want to take on the artifact sneakers I think I

1032
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:27,840
know how they work but you brought you might you probably pay more attention to the details

1033
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:34,000
yeah I mean listen artifact I think they've been trailblazers in the category right and you know

1034
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:39,280
I think they they got acquired by Nike because of you know all the cool things that they were doing

1035
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,680
I think that you know all the things that they've done have been like really pushing boundaries and

1036
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:51,840
I you know I think most people know what they do and you know they've created these digital

1037
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,360
components and then also for the most part usually have these forging windows where you can then

1038
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:02,000
claim physical product at which point they fulfill that product and then send it out

1039
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,840
and I believe it's interesting to watch these different drop mechanics and you know I know this

1040
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:14,080
as well because I'm going through it with the stuff that I'm doing at 90cc whereas I you know I

1041
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:19,760
don't know if we have found out like the best drop mechanics just yet so I think you're gonna see a

1042
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:26,240
lot of playing around with how drops work with how you know how do you fulfill physical product

1043
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:31,120
right because especially when it comes to something like clothes or sneakers where everyone wears a

1044
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:39,280
different size you can't necessarily pre-sell sizing but you know because then you fragment

1045
01:18:39,280 --> 01:18:43,920
the market a little too much right and it's like what you know what is that right balance between

1046
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:48,960
liquidity and the right balance between getting the product out there and and time frames but

1047
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,000
you know I think artifact has has done an amazing job for the physical digital space

1048
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,720
over the last two years and you know they're they're always going to be a team to watch

1049
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,440
and you know for the audience I think most people know that they're now owned by Nike right and so

1050
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:14,000
I view them not just as an interesting organization but my guess is this is like the

1051
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:22,320
R&D lab for these ideas in Nike in general and the ones that are successful will probably see

1052
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:30,000
rolled out at Nike scale which is just an absolutely gigantic scale right like so

1053
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:37,280
yeah and I look at this and I think when you want to talk about you know mass adoption

1054
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:42,880
and consumer adoption like you know when you have brands like Nike and Adidas coming into the space

1055
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:48,720
like you know I mean it's almost inevitable that you know you at some point soon you will be getting

1056
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:53,680
adoption because these are brands that drive culture right these are brands that you know

1057
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:58,080
probably you know Nike's probably one of the coolest brands on the planet right and so

1058
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:04,720
whatever it is that they do and to your point is I I would take a strong guess that artifact is

1059
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:10,800
almost like their web 3 R&D team and when things work within artifact then they start scaling that

1060
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,040
across their organization and that's when you're going to start seeing a lot of people start to

1061
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:22,240
get onboarded into the space you had actually helped bring Adidas into the space right

1062
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:28,880
yep I partnered with them board apes and punk's comic for their for their initial drop

1063
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:37,120
and how did you and I'm curious for me I don't know procedural perspective you're

1064
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:45,680
sitting there you want some NFTs you think you think big companies should do this but I assume

1065
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:53,040
these big companies don't didn't then know really much about NFTs how did you make that happen

1066
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,760
um so you know I got randomly DM'd by somebody on their team who told me you know he loved what

1067
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:09,200
I was doing he worked at Adidas on their web 3 on their web 3 team and he wanted to chat now I had

1068
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:13,920
no idea if he really worked at Adidas or not but I figured you know what's a 20 minute phone call

1069
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:19,360
like you know what if he really does work at Adidas it turned out he did and you know we ended up

1070
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:24,880
having these like amazing conversations because because my thesis and my thought process behind

1071
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,200
you know working with any large organization is that I want them to onboard onto crypto rails

1072
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:36,320
onto decentralized rails right because at some point right and this is almost like the world we

1073
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:43,360
live in now is you know your your conglomerates that exist in the legacy world today will try to

1074
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:48,080
you know do something that is let's say web 3 but not entirely web 3 you'll be like let's say within

1075
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:54,320
their their wall garden of an ecosystem and they'll call it web 3 you'll be let's say a digital

1076
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:59,520
collectible but there won't be true ownership there and so you know the more of these brands that we

1077
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:05,120
can build on truly decentralized rails then the better it is for all of us as consumers right

1078
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:10,560
like when you think about when you see all these movies about these dystopian futures of what that

1079
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:16,640
world looks like usually it's where there's you know one one person or a small council of people

1080
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:22,480
deciding and making decisions for all of humanity and people you know don't have any say in what they

1081
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:29,360
can do with their assets right and the more digital our lives become then the more that these high

1082
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:35,840
councils can control what it is and and what it is and what we do with with our assets and so that's

1083
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,840
why for me like building on Ethereum building on you know EVM compatible chains is something that

1084
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:47,680
I firmly believe in because there is you know asset ownership there where okay maybe if you

1085
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:52,880
violate the terms of service you can't play in that world but the assets you own are still yours

1086
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:59,120
right there's there's always that story that people say of you know how I think Vitalik was banned

1087
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:03,520
from World of Warcraft and that was like part of his reasoning for creating Ethereum right where

1088
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:10,880
he lost you know he found like a bug in the system was able to take advantage of it but then lost his

1089
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:16,400
account and lost all of his work because of it when and and that's like well I should have ownership

1090
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:22,640
over my property because I paid for it right like you know how valuable would it be to a gamer that

1091
01:23:22,640 --> 01:23:27,920
you know let's say spent a thousand dollars on Fortnite the size they don't want to play Fortnite anymore

1092
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,160
right instead of just having a thousand dollars of sunk you know skin cost that they can never get

1093
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:36,720
back if they can get some sort of return on that saying like okay somebody else wants to buy these

1094
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:43,840
I don't want to own them and I think that you know the more that we can teach these brands to build

1095
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:49,440
on these truly decentralized rails I think the better it will be for society because then that

1096
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:55,280
leads to more adoption on those decentralized rails which leads to more ownership over your

1097
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:04,080
personal property in the future I couldn't agree with you more this is I think where we are fully

1098
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:11,120
aligned I think you and I focus on different things but the general objective is the same that the

1099
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:17,120
more we can get people to use standardized public interoperable rails the better the world will be

1100
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:28,000
in the long run okay let's shift gears and take some questions for the from the audience and I'll

1101
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:40,880
go vp I'll go into the discord so that I can find the questions as they're being asked and give me a

1102
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:48,240
second I will see what what the people want to know

1103
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:59,920
all right privacy concerned walking around with a scalable NFC could lead to dioxing or even

1104
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:06,000
tracking how do we protect privacy with NFC readable wearables risks of document tracking and

1105
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:12,480
it's a good question well how do you think about this um so with regards to tracking we don't

1106
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:20,480
track any data right the NFC chips are like not powered right so that so there's no like tracking

1107
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:26,640
of personal data all you do is basically like you can scan you know where that shirt is at one

1108
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:33,280
point in time right and you know this is something I've thought long about as well with you know and

1109
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:39,760
I think we're probably going to be moving towards a world of zk right where you can uh at test that

1110
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,720
somebody was somewhere without that person necessarily having to sew things on blockchain I just don't

1111
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:50,880
think that the tech is there just yet but I do think long term you know people will be able to

1112
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:56,400
turn on or turn off like you know privacy concerns and certain stuff like yeah I don't want you know

1113
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:03,680
let's say um people that collect my po-op to kind of know where I am at a given point in time if let's

1114
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:09,040
say I'm at a party at a specific event right and this already exists with let's say when people scan

1115
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:16,080
po-ops uh per se is like you scan in uh you collect the po-op for that event um you have to be there

1116
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:21,680
to collect that po-op I think over time we'll probably see a move towards whether it's zk or

1117
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:28,880
maybe not everything is stored on chain or you have the opportunity to kind of um send that po-op

1118
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:33,920
like after the fact so you don't necessarily know who's there in real time um I think that these

1119
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:38,400
are all concerns I've definitely thought about it I just I feel like at the at this point in time

1120
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:43,760
we're like in the proof of concept phase that we can then iterate on and tackle those privacy

1121
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:49,600
concerns but I I definitely you know as somebody you know as pretty much everybody on the planet

1122
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:54,720
is probably tracked through their phone uh realizing how important that data is and making sure that

1123
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:00,160
you have the trust you know you have our trust that you know we're not collecting you know real

1124
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:05,200
time data on where you are uh in order to you know geotarget or whatever have you

1125
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:13,040
right and I don't know if the question was meant that you attract them could someone I don't know

1126
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:22,160
how the tech works could someone use a remote reader to scan someone's shirt at a distance

1127
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:29,920
no I I don't like because because of the like the the like the communication field for that is

1128
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,920
solo like you have to you have to put your phone like very close uh to the actual chip in order

1129
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:40,720
to get because again there's no power in the chip so it's kind of powered by the device that

1130
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:47,840
scans it so the device has to be close to kind of like utilize it sorry that's the the near field

1131
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:55,360
and NFC right like so I if I were wearing the shirt and someone wanted to scan my NFC chip

1132
01:27:55,360 --> 01:28:01,280
I'd notice because they'd be right next to me yeah they they'd be rubbing their phone up against your

1133
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:10,160
shirt could be awkward it could be um okay here's the question how many people put their shirts

1134
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:15,040
in storage I guess your initial drop how many people said give me this t-shirt I'm wearing it

1135
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:23,280
down in Miami and how many have kept it in the vault for future results yep so um from the initial

1136
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:29,520
drop I think we're at a little bit above 40% of people that took delivery of the shirt to wear it

1137
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:39,600
and from the second drop I think we're at around 50% um you know we we did about 50% um live in Miami

1138
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:44,720
of the mint because we really wanted to showcase the you know the actual generative manufacturing

1139
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:50,400
process live on the ground and then uh you know I think the interesting thing about the second drop

1140
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:56,400
is it's probably more of a collectible as well it's like it's an affordable chromisquiggle uh

1141
01:28:56,400 --> 01:29:02,080
interestingly enough there was a father son uh his son had always wanted a chromisquiggle but

1142
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:07,120
they were priced out of it um because they found out about swiggles too late he took his son out of

1143
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:13,440
school for a day and they flew down together had this experience where he minted a squiggle a shirt

1144
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:19,760
as a squiggle variant and now that like his his son's uh version of a squiggle so I think that like

1145
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,880
wow the interesting thing is going to be uh you know seeing that like collectibility play into

1146
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:29,680
things as well because there you know this one this is a rift right so this one is rarer than than a

1147
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:38,400
floor next question are there companies out there working to build platforms specifically

1148
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:43,840
the designs to enable this concept of moving from databases to markets across industries

1149
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:49,360
I'm aware of teams doing this individually fly fishing restaurants links down and golf

1150
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:54,800
but is anyone building out the tooling to do it across industries I have answers but let me hear

1151
01:29:54,800 --> 01:30:01,360
your answer but I'll comment on this I don't know anybody that's trying to build a platform like

1152
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:07,120
this at scale I think even as you were presenting it I feel like it becomes very industry specific

1153
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:12,480
because I think some of the hardest stuff is to get the buy-in right like I think you have to be

1154
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:20,800
in the travel industry and very high up to be able to convince like you know uh booking.com

1155
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:27,760
Expedia and all these companies to come into this same protocol so I think it becomes very

1156
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:33,680
industry specific at least for the foreseeable future but I but maybe I'm wrong I'd love to hear

1157
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:45,520
what you think 6529 yeah um I guess my super abstract view of this is that if the outcome

1158
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:54,800
um is anyway NFTs NFTs are the platform right like the whole point generally

1159
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:04,720
network type protocols whether it's TCP IP or SMTP or Bitcoin right FTS works specifically

1160
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:10,160
because you don't have to get everyone to agree to do something together right like the social

1161
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:14,720
coordination costs are really high because you're just oh I want to do my platforms I was all

1162
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,960
know I have a better idea I'll do it this way than someone else who I have I have access to the

1163
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:25,920
market in France and I'm going to do it this other way and so and I think a lot of these are going

1164
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:33,040
to need industry specific tooling right the solution for how it works on restaurants is going to be

1165
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:39,120
different than golf courses which is also going to be different than apartments which will also

1166
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:47,280
be different than fashion and so for me I don't know I don't know what a generic tooling would look

1167
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:53,920
like other than the generic tooling being NFTs and so like if people do whatever they're going to do

1168
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:04,800
on their individual workflow but in the end um people can uh represent their claims when NFT

1169
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:13,760
then you get to pick up as the issuer all of the infrastructure that is being built generically

1170
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:19,520
for NFTs right like you don't have to build a marketplace there's going to be many marketplaces

1171
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:25,760
right you don't have to build a lending platform you don't have to build the gallery to display

1172
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:32,160
them right because people are going to be building these things for NFTs as a whole and if we get

1173
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:41,360
like a couple of years in the future another maybe order of magnitude worth of adoption in

1174
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:46,480
people and applications I think it's over right like then the incentives you're not going to have

1175
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:54,080
to like tell companies things about like decentralization it will just be obvious that if they issue

1176
01:32:54,080 --> 01:33:01,760
their claim as an NFT it is better for them than trying to build an end-to-end infrastructure by

1177
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:07,440
themselves because they'll never keep up with literally the whole internet building infrastructure

1178
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:17,040
for brc721s and 1155s or whatever the the variations will be on other blockchains right so I think

1179
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:27,520
that's where I come out of this one the next question is for me um I will laugh about this one

1180
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:33,440
can we use NFTs as proof of knowledge passing courses college courses etc really yes there

1181
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:36,400
if you pass the exam with other those courses you're going to get an NFT absolutely

1182
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:46,320
you are in specifically the um the service that we'll use NFT as a proof of knowledge

1183
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:54,000
okay i think i have a follow up on that for you um when when you issue those NFTs will they be

1184
01:33:54,000 --> 01:34:01,600
sold out so this is a great question and I have discussed this in great detail with the unit team

1185
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:14,080
and that it all start with a conclusion they will not be sold out and I'll tell you why because

1186
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:20,720
that was their first question maybe sold out if I have an educational credential that I'm

1187
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:30,480
going to keep for years decades right well the odds that my wallet is not going to be different

1188
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:39,760
20 years from now is literally zero right I've gone through three wallets or ready since I started

1189
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:46,240
with NFTs and looking maybe me as well I have I have my nuisance wallet my safe vault maybe

1190
01:34:46,240 --> 01:34:52,000
won't change but the odds that the average person in this class is not going to change their wallet

1191
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:59,920
zero zero like people might have started with a hot wall then maybe they might go to a treasure

1192
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:04,720
maybe they'll go to some social recovery wall maybe they'll later go to a multi-sick wallet I mean

1193
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:09,760
and this I think all these things are going to happen in the next 18 months not in the next like

1194
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:18,720
18 years right so a model where we say oh it's so bound because a model where people are going to

1195
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:24,080
get stuck needing to move them and then what that's going to be is someone is going to have to come

1196
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:32,400
to UNIC and say move it to this new wallet and I need to somehow explain to you that I'm the same

1197
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:50,160
person and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I believe it is operationally impossible right and for this to exist over decades right so I start with I don't think the soulbound model generally works I'm not

1198
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,360
actually quite bearish on the Soulbound model.

1199
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:54,840
I think it needs to be solved with other ways.

1200
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:57,720
And it's like, oh, do the other ways are problems?

1201
01:35:57,720 --> 01:35:58,520
Yes.

1202
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,240
It's just the Soulbound one.

1203
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,320
Effectively, the only way you solve the Soulbound

1204
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,360
is to just make it centralized.

1205
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:08,840
But if you make it centralized,

1206
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,160
then Munich might as well just keep it in their database

1207
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:14,840
of people who have completed the course, right?

1208
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,160
Then what's the difference?

1209
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:17,720
You can always call up Munich and say,

1210
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,280
hey, did I complete this course, right?

1211
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:21,000
So that's back in one.

1212
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,960
And then it's interesting to see what Munich

1213
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,960
and other academic institutions did in the past.

1214
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,960
So I don't know if you ever discussed this on this course,

1215
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:33,520
one of their, they had, I think,

1216
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:36,000
where the first issue to plume was on the blockchain

1217
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,840
as on the Bitcoin blockchain.

1218
01:36:38,840 --> 01:36:40,920
Pretty long before and if these.

1219
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:43,720
And their solutions were interesting

1220
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:48,320
because it is, it was a hash into the Bitcoin blockchain

1221
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:49,920
and you got a PDF and those are merciful

1222
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:52,800
for all these things that we're using now

1223
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,000
for allow us to what have you.

1224
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,440
And you could check if the hash of your PDF

1225
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,880
was in that transaction, right?

1226
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:04,720
So there it was interesting

1227
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,320
because it wasn't even in your wallet at all, right?

1228
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,760
You just have a PDF.

1229
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:11,000
And that PDF you could check if it was,

1230
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,360
it's like the end of Sicha, right?

1231
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:15,400
Like you can say I have this off chain good,

1232
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,160
but I can tell you if it exists

1233
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:18,880
on chain transaction.

1234
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:23,480
So that's one model, it's portable with the user, right?

1235
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,680
So that's one interesting model.

1236
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:27,640
Now on NFTs,

1237
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,280
and I think what's gonna happen on this course,

1238
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,240
though George and I haven't finalized it,

1239
01:37:39,240 --> 01:37:40,920
well, there's a couple of things you can do.

1240
01:37:40,920 --> 01:37:44,120
First of all, we're gonna let people

1241
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:48,280
if they choose put their name on it, right?

1242
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,680
If they put their name on it,

1243
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,880
they have to pick one person that it is, right?

1244
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:58,160
So if you want to say,

1245
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,280
if I say I'm Mike Smith, I completed this course,

1246
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,560
selling my Sicha, I was like,

1247
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:06,680
oh, what if they sell their credentials, right?

1248
01:38:06,680 --> 01:38:09,200
Well, if my credentials are Mike Smith,

1249
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,960
and I sell them to Sally,

1250
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:16,040
what good is it gonna do Sally?

1251
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,320
Right, like I'd have to find another Mike Smith.

1252
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:20,840
And I was like, well, I don't wanna do that,

1253
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:23,840
I wanna put my ETH address.

1254
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,560
Okay, that's fine.

1255
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:28,400
You can put 6.5 to 9. ETH.

1256
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:33,200
But then it's really only relevant to whoever

1257
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:38,200
has built up reputation as 6.5 to 9. ETH, right?

1258
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:41,760
And it's not generically sellable, right?

1259
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,520
I mean, why is that gonna be useful?

1260
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:44,960
What'll be useful to you?

1261
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:46,720
If you said, like, hey, look,

1262
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,520
I completed the course, here's my certificate.

1263
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:51,240
And on the certificate on the NFT,

1264
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,120
it says 6.5 to 9. ETH.

1265
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:56,600
I was like, wait, that's not you, right?

1266
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:57,440
Is it all well?

1267
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,480
What if,

1268
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:03,120
or what if someone takes the course

1269
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:04,440
in someone else's name?

1270
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:07,160
Well, sure, that's a risk,

1271
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,280
but that's not solved by sold-bound token.

1272
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:11,640
That's solved by KYC, right?

1273
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:13,960
And so then there's an interesting question.

1274
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,640
Do you want to, you know, obviously for,

1275
01:39:18,280 --> 01:39:19,960
I understand if you complete,

1276
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,880
go on from this course and do the degree program,

1277
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,720
you will effectively get KYC

1278
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,480
because the University want transcripts

1279
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:28,120
and all these other things and like,

1280
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:30,120
you're, I don't know, driver's license passport,

1281
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:30,960
I don't know what they'll need,

1282
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:33,280
but like, you don't get KYC, right?

1283
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:34,960
Now for a course like this,

1284
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:38,440
where someone is going to show their credential

1285
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,520
in their wallet, right?

1286
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,880
To me, the right answer,

1287
01:39:45,880 --> 01:39:47,200
they're in the right balance

1288
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:50,720
between decentralization and practicality

1289
01:39:51,640 --> 01:39:53,720
is that it's not sold-bound,

1290
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:58,720
that people can either put a physical name on it,

1291
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,960
or they can put an enist name on it,

1292
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:05,640
and then they can move it from place to place,

1293
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,760
and you know, their physical name

1294
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:08,640
is going to stay with them the rest of your life,

1295
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,520
presumably, and your enist can actually transport

1296
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,680
across wallets, right?

1297
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:20,600
I might change, I'm using some model treasure

1298
01:40:20,600 --> 01:40:23,760
at 6.529.eth, right?

1299
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,160
Do I think in 20 years,

1300
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:26,920
the same treasure is going to be working now,

1301
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,080
I'm pretty sure it won't be, right?

1302
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,640
I'm pretty sure we're using something else,

1303
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,960
but I can certainly 6.529.eth, right?

1304
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,600
And if I had a certificate that was issued and signed

1305
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,960
by 6.529.eth, okay, what differences it make

1306
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,240
if it's in the difference of theorematics?

1307
01:40:45,240 --> 01:40:47,120
So, that's how we're thinking about it.

1308
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:50,920
I think we'll be making some decisions soon,

1309
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:54,080
and we'll probably like, tweet about it

1310
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:56,440
and what the trade-offs are,

1311
01:40:56,440 --> 01:41:01,520
but I just think you have to assume that the soulbound token

1312
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,000
concept is effectively for this purpose,

1313
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:09,320
unworkable, or indistinguishable with being centralized,

1314
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:12,480
and then see how you work out those solutions.

1315
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,720
Yeah, and I tend to agree with that.

1316
01:41:14,720 --> 01:41:16,400
I've been thinking a lot about it, right?

1317
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:18,760
Where it's like, it's almost like,

1318
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:20,840
effectively you're creating like an account, right?

1319
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,160
And then each wallet is almost like a sub account

1320
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,760
associated with that account.

1321
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,360
And to your point is like, you don't know,

1322
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:29,240
you know, you don't know if you're going to use your wallet

1323
01:41:29,240 --> 01:41:31,120
for the rest of your life, probably not, right?

1324
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:33,000
Because of the nature of technology.

1325
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,480
So you need to have that ability to self-transfer things.

1326
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:37,960
So that makes sense to me.

1327
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:40,440
I think that that's probably, and I think delegate cash

1328
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:43,040
is probably one of those examples, right?

1329
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:46,320
Of like almost creating like a user account,

1330
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,480
and then you have all these sub accounts,

1331
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,080
and you can then sexualize risk, right?

1332
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:54,200
From a different perspective, but I do think that like,

1333
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:55,840
these rules apply to that as well.

1334
01:41:56,840 --> 01:41:59,520
Yeah, delegate cash fixes another problem,

1335
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:02,160
which is an all the delegation solutions,

1336
01:42:02,160 --> 01:42:05,240
which is not minting from your cold wallet, right?

1337
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,880
But I think for this problem of which,

1338
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:09,480
the other people, the reason people always ask

1339
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,000
it like is it so modern on is,

1340
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:12,840
but what if someone else gets the certifications

1341
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:15,080
of the person at the course, right?

1342
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,440
But I think the answer to that is,

1343
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,800
you can put a name on it, but your name can also

1344
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:22,200
be a real name or it can be an ENS.

1345
01:42:22,200 --> 01:42:27,200
And the ENS abstracts away,

1346
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,840
not just a hot wallet, it can abstract away your name wall.

1347
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:33,560
No, right?

1348
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:35,520
Now, let's say someone's self,

1349
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,080
let's say I sell my whole digital identity, okay, fine,

1350
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:42,200
but like, honestly, I'm gonna sell my whole digital identity.

1351
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:45,440
I'm not gonna do it because of a certificate

1352
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:46,640
from a MOOC course, right?

1353
01:42:46,640 --> 01:42:51,640
I mean, like there's bigger issues at play there than this, right?

1354
01:42:53,120 --> 01:42:55,880
And it's putting the card,

1355
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:58,520
if tomorrow you turn into six times a night,

1356
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:00,320
I think it's okay, fine, but like,

1357
01:43:00,320 --> 01:43:03,040
I don't think the real issue is that you'll also

1358
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,200
get my MOOC certificate.

1359
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:08,320
Yeah, makes total sense.

1360
01:43:11,680 --> 01:43:14,760
Okay, I think this was a great session.

1361
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:17,440
I think we've ran basically,

1362
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:18,880
we try to keep them an hour and a half,

1363
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:21,320
maximum two, we're right on time.

1364
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:23,680
I want to thank you so much for coming and joining.

1365
01:43:23,680 --> 01:43:26,200
We very much appreciate you taking the time.

1366
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:29,320
It is great to learn from practitioners in the field.

1367
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:34,120
We now have, this is for the members,

1368
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:38,120
we now have our minting ton of T-word for faster,

1369
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,320
so this will mint us in an FTE, I think soon,

1370
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,720
maybe by next week we'll have the site

1371
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:46,440
where students in the course can mint NFT

1372
01:43:46,440 --> 01:43:48,680
of any of these sessions and keep them seeing them,

1373
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:50,640
or just review them online

1374
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,880
or we need to get them into the campus as well.

1375
01:43:53,880 --> 01:43:57,760
And it will be there as a resource going forward.

1376
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,680
So it's not just the core certificate

1377
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,040
that's going to be NFT,

1378
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,520
each piece of course material is also NFT,

1379
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,240
including this session.

1380
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:12,160
And so the people can benefit from it over time.

1381
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,840
All right, well, thank you.

1382
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:42,480
And I think we can wrap this up.
