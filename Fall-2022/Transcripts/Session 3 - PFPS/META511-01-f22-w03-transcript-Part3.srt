I'm very excited about today's discussion we have with us today the very famous 4156 and has been

01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000


123
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000


124
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000


125
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000


126
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000


127
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000


128
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000


129
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000


130
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000


131
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000


132
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:10,720
six and has been famous in a variety of different contexts. He was an incredible collector. He is

133
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:18,240
now a builder and we're going to talk a little bit both about his journey from one area to the next

134
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:26,480
area. But then the part that I think we're really going to begin to, 4156 is a deep thinker about how

135
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,760
NFTs are going to work over the long run and that's some very distinctive and strong views about

136
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:40,720
what is going to make for successful NFT collections. So we're going to begin to those and

137
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:47,440
hit upon I think some real structural issues and he's using those structural issues. So first I'd

138
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:52,320
love to welcome him to the course. I very much appreciate the time he's taking with us today.

139
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:59,760
And before we get into any of these complicated issues, I'd love it if you could just share with

140
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:08,800
us a little bit your background and pathway in crypto and NFTs and how did we end up where we are

141
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:15,280
today in your life? What was that journey? What was that pathway? Take us from the beginning to

142
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,480
the present day and then we'll get into more of the concept structures.

143
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:27,760
Yeah, sure, absolutely and thanks a lot for having me. It was a really fun and interesting initiative

144
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:35,280
and really happy to participate. So I've been in the crypto space since about 2013

145
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:44,480
around that time. I was working at like a Y-combinator startup. I had kind of previous to that had

146
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:51,840
this kind of very mixed background where I was doing kind of more creative work and realized it

147
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:56,720
wasn't super efficient back then at paying the bills and thought that maybe learning about financial

148
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:05,440
markets would be kind of a valuable way to do that. And then I ended up I guess have a tendency to

149
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,480
become kind of obsessed with things. So I became very obsessed with traditional financial markets

150
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:18,480
in addition to the kind of creative pursuits that I was undertaking and spent a lot of time

151
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,760
learning to invest successfully. So at the time when I was working in a sort of creative

152
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:35,600
capacity at this startup, I learned about Bitcoin. I think I read the white paper somewhere around.

153
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:49,680
I think it was like the end of 2013 I believe. And I think I had to read through it a few times

154
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:59,440
but when it clicked, I think that it was in this sort of like meeting place in my kind of creative

155
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:05,920
and finance brain. And I just became completely obsessed with it, recognized immediately. It's

156
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:12,000
sort of potential to change the world ended up buying a bunch of Bitcoins. And then when this

157
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:23,600
first Bitcoin bubble happened very shortly after that, I decided I was just going to leave my

158
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:30,720
job by job and just kind of use the bit of capital that I had to to start building things on

159
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:39,200
on Bitcoin and block chains. And that was sort of like the genesis of my journey.

160
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:45,840
So I've been in the space since then kind of working in various capacities on different kinds

161
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:51,600
of projects. Some bootstraps, some venture funded, some were successful, some weren't.

162
01:08:51,600 --> 01:09:04,320
And after I guess a period of kind of relative quiet, I was kind of rediscovering some sort of

163
01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:14,160
creative pursuits and kind of started thinking about NFTs a little bit more. And kind of fell

164
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:20,720
down that rabbit hole. I would say that it was probably my sort of third kind of crypto rabbit hole

165
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:27,760
after becoming obsessed with Bitcoin and Ethereum. And again, it really sort of spoke to the creative

166
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:38,240
parts of my brain and kind of discovered crypto punks and very quickly sort of acquired a lot

167
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:44,320
of conviction that these were going to be important. And that we had always sort of thought

168
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:52,720
in the crypto space that the things that would make it go mainstream were sort of these like

169
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:59,200
financial applications like payments and very quickly after kind of discovering NFTs.

170
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:06,400
I think I started to understand that the application layer might be cultural rather than financial.

171
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:16,000
And yeah, as I sort of developed more conviction around that idea and ended up purchasing

172
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,920
punk for 156. So kind of very quickly acquired this conviction that NFTs were going to be

173
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:31,920
important and decided to take the leap and buy a crypto pumpkin. And my original thesis was

174
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:37,120
that it would be a really cool idea to buy a punk and kind of like build a brand around it.

175
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:47,120
My original kind of plan or intent was that for 156 was going to be a sort of artist

176
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:53,600
of its own within the NFTs space. And you know, this was kind of preliminary maybe a bit kind

177
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:59,600
of naive thinking. But now I was thinking that you know, the punk would like mint its own NFTs

178
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:05,120
about bananas and you know, just kind of do silly sort of like absurdist art around this idea.

179
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:09,760
And then kind of after getting deeper into this space kind of kind of had this realization

180
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:16,720
that collecting other work from other artists who were kind of much more accomplished and up

181
01:11:16,720 --> 01:11:23,600
to some very interesting stuff might be a kind of more interesting pursuit. And you know,

182
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:32,640
again, we can get into the kind of later realizations. I think that that ended up kind of leading

183
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:38,720
me to sell the punk and start working on nouns. But I think those are kind of related to other

184
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:44,880
questions. So yeah, the initial kind of run up into the space was again, and having this hybrid

185
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,360
kind of creative and finance background and going through these kind of long periods of building

186
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,120
and sort of obsession with different parts of the crypto technology stack with this more recent

187
01:11:55,120 --> 01:12:00,800
realization that NFTs were probably one of the most important developments so far in so far as

188
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:06,160
as they sort of represent the application layer and the way an awful lot of people get onboarded

189
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:14,400
into this tech. Okay, well, I think this is a great background and let's start with

190
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,480
actually punk 4156 because I had mentioned this in my presentation a couple of days ago.

191
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:29,040
The crypto punks, I don't think when they were launched were thought of as PFPs per se. I think

192
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:37,200
there was somewhere between collectible art, fun, crypto-native thing. And I'm not saying that

193
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:47,120
they were not used as PFPs by anyone before G-Money and you, but I've been in crypto since

194
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,280
2013. I think I read the white paper three or four months before you, so I think we're in the

195
01:12:51,280 --> 01:13:02,480
same crypto class. And it was very, very clear to me when this idea of a punk as a PFP entered

196
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:10,560
my radar screen and it was first with G-Money, I think it was in January 2021 and you in February

197
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:20,160
of 2021. That's if I'm not mistaken. And let's take it a little bit to this concept of a PFP

198
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:27,280
as an identity, how it's, how you thought of it, why you thought this would be a good idea.

199
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:34,560
Where are you mentally now about the idea of a PFP as an identity? Is it something people

200
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,000
are going to do? Is it something people are going to stick with one? Are they going to use

201
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:48,880
different ones? How does that fly out to you? Yeah, it's an interesting question. I had originally

202
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,760
also claimed some crypto punks on the day they were launched, just claimed a handful of them

203
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:59,040
because, again, early in the history of the space, there just wasn't that much to do and it was

204
01:13:59,040 --> 01:14:03,600
kind of seemed interesting. And I claimed a bunch of them and never really thought about them.

205
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:12,960
I think for me, it was also developing the thesis that you could build an identity around this

206
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,080
came much later than the realization that it was something you could own or that it might be

207
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:26,320
interesting to own. And if I think back to the time when they were launched, I do think

208
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:32,960
kind of initially there were a handful of people that were using them as their PFPs,

209
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,960
or certainly there was another project, and I can't even remember if this was like a blockchain

210
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:42,480
project or not, but there was a project called 8bit.me, I think around that time where people were

211
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:53,920
using the characters as their PFPs. So I think this idea was sort of in the air.

212
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:01,040
I think at a certain point kind of experimenting with Erbit, I had this idea that you could

213
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:07,760
take the Erbit ID and build a Twitter account around the Erbit ID. So I think all these ideas

214
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:15,360
were sort of in the air and it just took a handful of us to actually start doing it and

215
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:22,640
doing it with conviction for it to become very, very popular. As with any sort of important

216
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:28,960
trend, in the absence of the people that did it, other people would have done it and it would

217
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:37,920
have happened anyway. So there is something sort of inherent in the medium or inherent in the nature of

218
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:47,120
what kind of NFTs are and PFPs are that makes all of this make sense. And I don't know exactly

219
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:54,960
what it is, but it certainly seems to feel right. Certainly to the extent that people don't just

220
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,440
want to be themselves online, they want to be a character and to the extent that it's kind of

221
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:12,960
interesting and fun that being a character in the context of a community of fixed size where

222
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,320
other people also want to be similar characters, but not exactly the same character. That's a lot

223
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:26,000
of fun. And then also this idea that what NFTs are, maybe they're this thing that is sort of

224
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,400
able to soak up or capture all sorts of cultural value that other financial assets can't,

225
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:39,440
and that all of the things that you do online could sort of accrue value to this sort of cultural

226
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:45,760
value sink. All of these things kind of mixed up together and make it just very interesting and fun.

227
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:54,400
And kind of intuitive to use these things as PFPs. I don't think it's just like a short-term trend,

228
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:01,440
I do think it's here to stay. And I don't think there's as with most kind of sustainable trends,

229
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:04,880
there's not just one reason for doing it. There's kind of lots of reasons for doing it that are all

230
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:13,440
mixed up together. Okay, so then in a few months after that, I think there are a couple of episodes

231
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:19,680
that stick in my mind where I think you're very vocal about a certain point of view.

232
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,080
And in both cases, but certainly the first case, you weren't completely alone, but you were

233
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:32,160
more on the alone side than not on the alone side. I think the first case was when the crypto

234
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:39,200
folks came out and for those in order to know this, this was someone who did a project and took

235
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:44,640
all the crypto punks and flipped them. I think it was the exact same. Punks and they flipped them

236
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:53,120
facing the other way. And at least among some punk holders, this caused an uproar. They felt

237
01:17:53,120 --> 01:18:00,880
it would somehow hurt their punk. And I think a lot of pressure went on Larva Labs to do something

238
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:07,280
about it, to file a DMCA or somehow take action against the folks. And I remember because I

239
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:14,000
think this was very obvious to me. You were very much against Larva Labs doing anything.

240
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,040
And you were saying like, this is silly why are you doing it? It's the token bit matters.

241
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:25,680
This is very silly. Tell us a little bit about that because you were I think outside of the

242
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,400
punk's consensus and even Larva Labs' consensus then.

243
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:35,040
Yeah, sure. And I think there were a few reasons for that as well.

244
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:44,640
You know, I think as someone who had been on the internet for a long time and sort of really

245
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:55,120
understood the way memes and kind of culture flow on the internet, it just seemed logical to me

246
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:06,400
that it would be a bad idea to kind of censor people who are kind of engaging in remix culture

247
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:15,440
with a brand. Like that sort of fan culture, that sort of remix culture I think historically has

248
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:22,160
supported the proliferation of things and supported the growth of things that would otherwise

249
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:28,480
be obscure. So it just it seemed very counterintuitive to me that that you would want to censor it.

250
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:35,040
It was also the case and we can get more into this if you want, but it was also the case that

251
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:45,360
I was never really sure if if crypto punks were sort of like I always thought that they were

252
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:50,880
a work of genius. I was never really sure if they were kind of like an intentional or accidental

253
01:19:50,880 --> 01:20:02,480
work of genius. And I sort of took the the the act of censorship as like a little bit of evidence.

254
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:09,520
I think at that time that it might have been a bit more accidental. Again, and you know that's

255
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,480
not at all to sort of like discredit the invention and discredit larval labs and what they created.

256
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:22,480
But more to say that maybe they didn't necessarily fully comprehend that thing that they had

257
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:28,880
created in the way that some people who are a bit more crypto native might have. And I sort of

258
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,680
took this to be like a little bit of evidence that that maybe you know as as like a company or a

259
01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:41,040
group. They they weren't quite as as kind of like aligned with the crypto ethos as I thought they

260
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:46,720
were. And and so you know I think I started speaking out out of a combination of like

261
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:54,640
trying to advocate for the thing that would would create the maximum amount of value for punks.

262
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:59,760
And then also out of concern that that you know that the stewards of this brand might be a little

263
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:06,720
bit out of touch with the ethos of the space. And so I think that's a great follow on to what

264
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:13,840
happened next. It's I think you were pushing for larval labs to have more permissive licensing

265
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:20,800
back than their approach on licensing was at best unclear. And I think most people thought

266
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:30,320
maybe you could use it up to a hundred thousand dollars per year of of earnings and the

267
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:37,360
rebits license seem to emphasize something similar. So it was quite restrictive by what is now

268
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:44,560
the current standards. And you were pushing for this model. There wasn't much of a response.

269
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,840
And then you're very famously sold for one five six which I think was shocking to people.

270
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:57,760
What was the logic there? Yeah sure so yeah you know I think all of this was kind of against

271
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:05,920
a backdrop of just kind of developing a thesis over time. You know and I think it had started

272
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:13,600
kind of significantly before that. It actually I think it started like a day or two after I bought

273
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:18,320
for one five six. Because when I bought for one five six I never really thought about sort of like

274
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:22,720
the copyright implications of trying to use for one five six as like a personality or an artist

275
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:29,600
or a character. And a couple days later I thought I wonder what is the license on this thing

276
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:35,600
that I bought. And so I started googling it and Google returned this article that I think had been

277
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:43,760
co-created by Larva Labs and some a prominent law firm. I assumed it was their law firm at the time

278
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:49,600
that talked about you know it was a blog post that that detailed like the order of operations to

279
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:57,040
create a license that could be transferable within NFT. So I read this and you know with

280
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:02,800
the understanding that it came from Larva Labs own firm believed that oh you know they must have

281
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:11,040
a pretty liberal stance towards copyright if they're kind of co-publishing this sort of thought

282
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:16,560
leadership with their lawyers. So I guess it's probably fine to do my own thing. And so I started

283
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,400
doing my own thing and I had kind of DM the founders on a couple of occasions just to confirm that

284
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:28,240
their stance was sort of as liberal as that blog post kind of made it seem and they just never

285
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:38,240
responded. And so like kind of as time went on and you know they were doing things like DMCA

286
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:46,000
and Fox. I started to worry a lot about well you know I mean worry about my specific kind of situation

287
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,200
where I was I was starting to like build a brand around this thing and maybe I didn't own this

288
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:57,840
thing. But then you know more generally again kind of worry about did they actually understand

289
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,560
what was happening in the community because if like the whole thing that the community was doing

290
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:10,160
was sort of like engaging in you know using these characters as their PFPs and you know kind of

291
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,560
experimenting with building brands and personalities around them and again using the sort of NFT as

292
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,640
as the sort of like sinking mechanism that like absorbs all of the activity that that that

293
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:30,320
people are doing like nobody wants to do that that nobody wants to do that with something that

294
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:35,600
they don't own in the in the long run right like nobody wants to kind of invest all this time

295
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:42,080
in a situation where they could easily sort of be rugged by by the creators at some point in

296
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:47,120
the future. And so you know I started to worry about it both in terms of my own situation

297
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:51,440
but then also in terms of like is this thing as valuable as everybody thinks it is if if people

298
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:58,320
can't actually do the thing with it that that they want to be doing. Now you know with in hindsight

299
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:04,960
it seems a bit less obvious because I think after this conversation took place the narrative

300
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:10,560
sort of shifted you know as it has happened in crypto on other occasions with Bitcoin going from

301
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:16,560
you know being a payments mechanism to digital gold I think you know punks went from things that

302
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:22,960
like people were using to represent their identity on some level to like you know the narrative

303
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:26,800
the community changed the narrative to then kind of identify them as these historical artifacts

304
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,800
right where where like you know the token was the only thing that mattered and copy right

305
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:36,400
wouldn't matter but you know I started to disagreed with that stance and and you know I just

306
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:40,880
thought it just does not make sense to continue to build a brand around something that I probably

307
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:46,160
don't own and you know this thing is very valuable and I can use the capital for other things so

308
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:51,920
you know I made I think at the time what felt like a very hard decision but I think ultimately

309
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,600
the correct decision to to sell sell the punk and focus on other things.

310
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:06,160
So after a few months after you did that and was hey for sure a bigger shock to everyone

311
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:12,800
larvalabs then sold the IP to you that which then proceeded to put in a much more

312
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:22,320
permissive license um a commercial license and this caused I think it's fair to say all types

313
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:30,800
of mixed feelings among the punks holders and might take on it which I don't know it might be

314
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:36,720
right it might be wrong I don't know my take on it was objectively the license is better it's

315
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:44,400
more permissive it's more creative than it was before but what's clear but somehow the act of seeing

316
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:55,120
the light the IP being sold maybe shattered some views illusions I don't know the people had

317
01:26:55,120 --> 01:27:03,840
previously about how larvalabs viewed the punks and even though objectively

318
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:10,880
the punk owners had a better deal than they did ten minutes earlier a lot of them felt worse

319
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:16,560
about how how do you say when you are someone on the outside now but what are your views on this?

320
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:25,600
Yeah I mean I I think that when that happened it's sort of confirmed a lot of my fears so I

321
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:32,640
mean I think the reason that there are sort of like there was a bad feeling around that is that

322
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:40,080
again this sort of these brands are built by communities right like the the punks the punks

323
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:44,560
IP is valuable because the community made it that way because people like g-money and me and

324
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,280
you know lots of others kind of spent a lot of time kind of like turning our punks into characters

325
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:58,320
and kind of proliferating awareness about them and then you know to see that kind of monetized

326
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:03,040
by the creators without any real sort of meaningful value flowing back to the community

327
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:09,680
I think that it sort of points out the kind of misalignment of incentives that was taking place

328
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:16,160
there I also think and again you know I tend to be kind of like a lot more purist and kind of

329
01:28:16,160 --> 01:28:20,480
extreme in my views than a lot of people so you know to take this for what it's worth but like I

330
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:26,720
don't think that a commercial license necessarily solves the problem yeah I don't think that

331
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:32,880
I don't think the commercial license necessarily solves the problem because because I think it's

332
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:40,880
the case that like no matter how permissive that license is it's the fact that it's revocable

333
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:49,440
that that will cause people to not make that kind of you know deep and fundamental investment

334
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:58,480
into you know building up the character or or building up the brand like I think no real serious

335
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:04,080
entrepreneur is going to ever consider putting in you know five years ten years whatever it takes

336
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:10,560
to like really build something meaningful when it's always the case that you know someone can pull

337
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:14,800
the rug and say hey you know by the way that thing you built you know that the IP has been transferred

338
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,920
to yet another another corporation and they don't want these things to have commercial licenses or

339
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:26,880
we don't like the sort of sort of business that you're building so I think the the thing that

340
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:36,320
the punk sort of received was kind of much lower in value than the thing that they saw kind of

341
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:44,480
larval labs receiving based off of you know the community's hard work and that you know that that's

342
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:49,840
sort of the reason that it didn't feel as good as as one might think it would intuitively

343
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:59,520
yep okay that I think that parts clear and before we go to nouns which is I think the logical next

344
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,760
step I want to take a sidetrack on something else because if we don't do it now I think I'm

345
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:11,840
going to forget you want also if you asked me a year and a half ago what thoughts come to mind

346
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:23,600
about you one was the pump 4156 but the other thing was that you're a very vocal ex-copy collector

347
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:29,840
and just wanted to take it's kind of a side path here but take two or three minutes to share your

348
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:35,600
thoughts about ex-copy you own some amazing ex-copies you own a lot of ex-copies you're a very

349
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:47,600
vocal about it ex-copy also now has cc zero his work so where's the 4152 now and ex-copy yeah sure

350
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:55,520
and you know I think again this this is like sort of interesting and and maybe evidence that all

351
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:02,160
of this stuff is kind of mixed up together and you really have to kind of tease out the the

352
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:10,240
different parts of it but like at the time I sold the punks and kept the ex-copy both punks and

353
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:19,280
ex-copy were you know we're not we're not cc zero and you know my my thesis around selling the

354
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,880
punk and keeping the ex-copy was that ex-copy was kind of more quote unquote crypto native than

355
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:31,360
than larval labs and that it would probably be the case that the work would eventually become cc zero

356
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:38,240
I mean also it was the case that the the the the kind of the premise of ownership was not you

357
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:43,200
know based around the sort of like avatar pfp movement and people sort of like creating things

358
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:48,400
around their their personas and so it seemed like you know the the commercial rights kind of

359
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:57,280
mattered less for for ex-copy and and so yeah you know I I think I feel sort of validated there

360
01:31:57,280 --> 01:32:03,120
in the sense that you know after the sale Larva transferred the IP to Yuga and an ex-copy kind of

361
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:09,440
cc zeroed all of their work so that that felt good but you know in terms of just like the the

362
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:16,320
the kind of like pure value of of the ex-copy ownership you know I think in in in most fields

363
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:21,680
and and I think especially early on in most fields you know you you have these these kind of like

364
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:28,640
outlier performers and and it's my view that that ex-copy is is one of these kind of outliers in

365
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:35,600
the context of crypto art I I think there's like a very sort of large gap between ex-copy and second

366
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:42,240
place whoever that might be I don't have an opinion but you know I I think certainly like if if

367
01:32:42,240 --> 01:32:48,320
there's there's anyone to have like a thesis around with with respect to crypto art I think it's

368
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:54,160
ex-copy I think the work I mean aesthetically it's incredible he's he's clearly you know they're

369
01:32:54,160 --> 01:33:01,440
clearly a master of their craft the the work itself I think is very interesting in the sense that

370
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:07,200
it sort of like talks about crypto history and it kind of like references crypto history in a way

371
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:14,800
that kind of like proves and proves ex-copy's crypto nativeness and and I think it's also the

372
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:22,800
case that these these NFT timestamps sort of matter and and again this is a whole other kind

373
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:28,720
of field or a whole other subject to get into but you know like if if if the things that sort of

374
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:35,360
matter with with respect to like crypto art are kind of like timestamps and and aesthetic and

375
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:43,200
provenance like ex-copy has all three kind of in in a way that that no other other artist does

376
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:48,720
right like the the work is stunning the work is very very early and the work is kind of like about

377
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:55,280
the movement and and kind of native to the movement in a way that almost nothing else is so I

378
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:59,360
I just think it's like it's a very very obvious like if you if you have a thesis with respect to

379
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:06,320
crypto art ex-copy is like the purest and highest quality way to kind of express that thesis and

380
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:12,160
you know they're they're just super cool to to own and and yeah I just everything about it is

381
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:18,560
just very very interesting in my opinion okay so I mean you're not going to get any objection to

382
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:24,400
me about from about from me about ex-copy I agree completely with everything you said two

383
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:30,560
interesting points that one of these out from there and one I think it's clear given your thesis

384
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:40,480
on why owning the IP is important the pfp's really do gain value from the activity of the community

385
01:34:41,120 --> 01:34:47,200
whereas an ex-copy less so now it's still probably better I think in view of you but it words

386
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:51,760
you're not that it is cc zero because of the derivatives will get more attention on what have

387
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:59,600
you but it is less if you own a certain ex-copy you and your personal activities are likely to

388
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:08,560
add less value to it than if you own a certain pfp is that a fair assessment yeah I think so like if

389
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:16,240
like the and I actually I don't know for sure like it could be possible that all of this is

390
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:20,800
the same thing and you know we're just talking about like very small nuances but like you know

391
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:28,400
intuitively it feels like if if I set my pfp to the Mona Lisa my my activities are going to have

392
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:33,600
very little impact on the Mona Lisa you I suppose you could argue to the extent that there's

393
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:38,160
there's only a small handful of people in the world that know ex-copy that you know if if I set my

394
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:43,760
my pfp to like this is clearly money laundering or right click save guy and you know what was like

395
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:51,520
a famous character that that was kind of like you know identifying as that thing but that that

396
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:59,120
actually it it could kind of operate the same way as it does in the in the pfp universe but

397
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:06,240
I think maybe the distinction is that like in in the pfp universe like

398
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:12,080
it doesn't really feel like anybody is sort of like competing around the same piece right like

399
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,840
there's the reason that there's 10,000 crypto punks and there's only one right click save guy

400
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:20,720
well actually not the reason that that that's true but but the the the consequence of that

401
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:26,400
is that like a community of 10,000 people can form and like each one can

402
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:33,120
can each individual in the community can kind of like inhabit one of the 10,000 but you know there's

403
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:37,760
only one right click save guy and so and so there's like maybe an unnatural amount of competition

404
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:43,280
that would emerge if everybody wanted to kind of inhabit that that identity so I don't know

405
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:49,040
there there's some sort of like cultural difference I guess even if mechanically all of these

406
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:54,080
things work the same way that there's like a cultural difference around the pfp's versus the

407
01:36:54,080 --> 01:36:58,720
the sort of canonical works of crypto art and and how people want to use them

408
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,480
that makes perfect sense and I want to go to the timestamp issue because this is one where

409
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:13,360
I think your view is what's generally believed um what I think I believe early crypto timestamps

410
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:19,680
are important but let me make the opposite case for a second if I think about major art movements

411
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:27,440
any of them like literally any major art will last a few hundred years nobody cares

412
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:39,120
what specific date the first piece of fill in your favorite art movement right was made right I

413
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:46,000
mean I don't even people maybe talk within decades they certainly I don't think talk within like days

414
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:54,640
or months and the pieces that you remember the pieces that have become important often come later

415
01:37:54,640 --> 01:38:01,360
in an artist's career I'll take Picasso Picasso's most famous work was not as early as work

416
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:07,200
as early as work is interesting historically what have you but if someone is going to pick the

417
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:14,480
Picasso you could pick only one Picasso and you could put it in your museum you wouldn't go to

418
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:20,640
young Picasso and take the first painting you made right how do we how do we reconcile this tour

419
01:38:20,640 --> 01:38:25,520
is it different with a blockchain yeah I mean I think it's different with a blockchain because

420
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:32,640
because like those those artistic movements weren't kind of built on top of time stamping machines

421
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:41,120
right like it it's it's it's related to the medium I think that the timestamps become more

422
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:48,560
important in crypto art than in traditional art um yeah I think it's just kind of like a

423
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:53,600
a fundamental property of the medium and again I'm not saying that like timestamp is the only thing

424
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:59,200
that's important you know I I think there's there's probably a Venn diagram and and you know maybe

425
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:05,280
maybe uh in in the context of crypto art like the timestamp circle is just like much larger than it is

426
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:14,480
in in in then in traditional art um I think like one one way you can think about this that I

427
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:19,040
I mean and again I don't know if this is right this is just kind of a crazy way that I think about

428
01:39:19,040 --> 01:39:27,840
it is like if you look at NFTs as as as as currencies right as social currencies and every artist

429
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:33,200
is kind of creating their own currency you know there there is a sense in which this the kind of

430
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:38,080
aggregate supply is unbounded right and and and the market will have to make decisions about

431
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:44,160
um you know which which ones are valuable and which ones aren't and again like looking at the

432
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:47,840
movement and looking at the culture you could you can reference something like Bitcoin which you

433
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:54,080
know we all know is sort of like obsessed with this this 21 million coin limit um if if you look

434
01:39:54,080 --> 01:40:01,120
at NFTs I believe you know it's like only very recently um have there been kind of 21 million

435
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:08,720
ERC721s created and and the number of of NFTs that are created is kind of increasing kind of

436
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:13,120
exponentially with adoption and interest in the technology so you have this like very obvious kind

437
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:20,560
of like um curve in in the in the NFT kind of money supply creation right that you know the

438
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:26,640
the kind of hockey hockey stick shaped growth that you see in as most technologies are adopted

439
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:33,120
and I think that curve makes makes like for a very interesting kind of thesis around collecting

440
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:38,640
right that like in in the early history of this space um these that this currency was much more

441
01:40:38,640 --> 01:40:44,320
scarce and if if the timestamps matter uh like old timestamps are more scarce the new timestamps

442
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:49,440
um and I just I don't think we have that sense when we think about uh think about paintings right

443
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:54,000
we we don't think about like the exponential growth of like canvases over time and and that we could

444
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:59,040
like track that with 100% certainty using some sort of technology but in in the context of NFTs

445
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:03,920
we can do that now whether people will do that I don't know but you know at minimum it's a kind

446
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:09,680
of interesting thesis to have or interesting kind of angled it to to use to think about the tech

447
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:19,120
got it makes sense well I guess we will this one we just won't know until the future right we're

448
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:24,880
going to have to like run the clock forward a few decades and then see see how it plays out it's

449
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:30,640
compelling it's compelling but it is it will be different I think if it happens okay I agree

450
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:35,920
great one one last point on that is like I mean someone could easily go and and kind of model it

451
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:41,680
today right like you you there's um there's probably some sort of like multi-factorial analysis

452
01:41:41,680 --> 01:41:46,880
that you could use to kind of like cancel out the the sort of like the provenance and aesthetic

453
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,640
premiums and and like just look purely at timestamp and just see if this sort of curve is intact

454
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:59,200
and I mean I would argue that like they're inferior at least could be a lot of value in doing

455
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:04,880
that because you could run some sort of statistical arbitrage on on timestamps you know if if if

456
01:42:04,880 --> 01:42:09,040
the pattern is emerging and then there are lots of kind of like outliers within the pattern

457
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:16,880
interesting interesting well if someone's listening and is good at math and good at reading data

458
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:25,680
from a watching there might be an interesting analysis to do there okay let's go now to nouns

459
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:33,280
because I think given what has happened over the last 45 minutes we can kind of see the pathway

460
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:40,960
to what nouns came from and let's start with describing your words you know what the nouns are

461
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:47,440
what they're trying to accomplish or the design design decisions that you made and how that links

462
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:56,560
to your thesis about what's going to work with NFTs in general or PFPs specifically yeah yeah sure

463
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:02,320
happy to do that yeah so I mean you know the the kind of invention of nouns was in many ways a

464
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:09,200
sort of reaction to you know all of the kind of like emergent issues that I saw with with crypto

465
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:21,600
punks and you know if I remember correctly I sold for 156 after yeah kind of a while after I had

466
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:27,040
already been kind of thinking about noun so you know it it wasn't necessarily that the reaction

467
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:33,840
to this like came from disillusionment with punks it had been just starting to think about like

468
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:40,160
you know what could could quote unquote punks 2.0 look like a while before that and and I thought

469
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:46,400
you know I thought I had kind of written down some interesting features that that it might have

470
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:53,520
so you know like like one of the issues that has has been kind of present all through crypto

471
01:43:53,520 --> 01:44:00,240
history it is is this sort of idea of fair distribution and and you know just the large extent to

472
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:04,000
which kind of being in the right place at the right time has has kind of like influenced

473
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:11,520
who ends up holding holding certain assets and and how how that group ends up kind of

474
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:18,720
using that luck in some ways to kind of like secret on on future crypto participants so I

475
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,200
thought well one one feature that you know this this next version of punks or you know however you

476
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:28,000
want to think about it should have is that you know the distribution should happen very very slowly

477
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,680
over time and I thought it might be really really interesting to start one of these collections with

478
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:51,120
with zero kind of zero money supplies zero instances and then just have like a new one created

479
01:44:51,120 --> 01:45:01,040
every day forever the forever part you know if if you kind of like kind of increase the money

480
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:09,680
money supply kind of slowly enough then it could just be kind of perpetually inflationary

481
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:19,280
and and you know it any one over over any any kind of period of crypto history would would have

482
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:25,600
in some sense like an equal opportunity to participate um so I thought that that's kind of where

483
01:45:26,320 --> 01:45:33,520
where one one one entity every day forever came from um then I started thinking about well like

484
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:44,880
you know if if um this project is like if it if it is going to to be forever then maybe it should be

485
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:56,880
um like what is the most extensive kind of what is the most extensible metaphor I can kind of come

486
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:05,520
up with um to create something that that could have this kind of longevity um and that's what

487
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:11,520
made me think about nouns um it's it's just so kind of not specific right you could you could

488
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:19,760
you could kind of include anything in in a collection that you know it it doesn't identify itself as

489
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:28,240
as punks or you know penguins like it you could just include anything at all and that might make

490
01:46:28,240 --> 01:46:38,560
it really fun um the next thing I thought about was was this sort of um the maybe a little bit of

491
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:46,080
a lack of coordination um that existed within the punks community and then also the fact that like

492
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:51,760
the whole reason that people had kind of got together to to kind of cheer these things on

493
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:59,920
like that that it was mostly predicated on this idea that that the price was going up or the number

494
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:07,280
was going up and you know what what might happen if um if that stopped what what would happen to

495
01:47:07,280 --> 01:47:13,040
kind of the culture if if the only thing to do in the community was kind of like cheer on the price

496
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:20,800
bubble um so then I thought about well maybe um maybe this this sort of thing you should

497
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:31,360
instantiate a doubt and then all all of the NFTs can can can act as this kind of governance tokens

498
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:39,840
for controlling uh the organization uh and and then um I thought well that that actually works

499
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:46,480
really well with this sort of like um perpetually inflationary money supply because in theory it

500
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:55,280
would mean that um the the doubt could have this this perpetual source of funding um and and so

501
01:47:55,280 --> 01:48:03,520
I mean you know it I kind of wrote down all of these ideas um noodle them for a couple of weeks

502
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:10,800
and then um had had this moment where I kind of composed them into a Twitter thread and just

503
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:15,760
did this got check of like should I hit send or not is this something I want to build or not

504
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:25,680
um and then I hit send on on you know you can look on my Twitter um and and see the I guess like

505
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:30,960
the sort of de facto what like paper that I wrote down for nouns and at the end of it I said hey

506
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:36,080
does anyone want to work on this um and I think it you know it was very fortunate that at that

507
01:48:36,080 --> 01:48:41,840
moment kind of in the history of the space um there were a lot of like really talented interesting

508
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:47,280
people around that were looking for something cool to work on um and a bunch of them reached out

509
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:53,520
and the rest was history over over the next few months we we built what nouns is today uh and we

510
01:48:53,520 --> 01:49:05,680
want we launched did on uh August 8 so in addition to one noun a day I think other interesting

511
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:13,760
features of the nouns are that the money from the sales is not received by you are the team that

512
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:19,600
goes into some type of treasury which we'll talk about you and the team are receiving aggregate one

513
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:29,520
in every 10 nouns for a period of time the the nouns are all cc 0 in the public domain and there

514
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:38,480
are no royalties right so this is quite a lot of different design decisions and in aggregate

515
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:48,080
I think your logic on some of these but I'd love to hear it is that they will allow the nouns

516
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:54,320
and the nouns culture or token or have you to spread further faster right is that the logic

517
01:49:54,320 --> 01:50:00,160
yeah that's that's right and yeah thanks for filling in those those details that I missed that

518
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:06,400
that that's right um you know that I think one of the sort of central um part of my central

519
01:50:06,400 --> 01:50:11,760
pieces around cc 0 is is that kind of copies make originals more valuable right if like

520
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:19,680
ultimately the thing that is valuable here is is the token is this kind of um thing that we

521
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:25,680
can you know we can point to the blockchain and and we can prove that you know beyond a doubt this

522
01:50:25,680 --> 01:50:33,920
this is the original original instance of a noun um that that you you no longer need in that context

523
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:42,720
to kind of um defend how an image is used or how an image is is proliferated um you know just

524
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:47,040
just like we look at um something like the original Mona Lisa and it's famous because

525
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:53,360
everybody knows what it is um it could be the case that you could have you know if you if you own

526
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:59,040
one of the very few original nouns and everybody in the world knows what they are that that you know

527
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:03,760
that might make them more valuable and so so the sort of like one of the objectives of these

528
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:08,480
communities and I think you know there's lots of subtle reasons we can we can identify that they

529
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:13,040
should have other objectives but one of the objectives of these communities is the sort of like

530
01:51:13,040 --> 01:51:19,520
cultural proliferation of the meme and and yeah a sort of set of initial conditions that let that

531
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:24,240
proliferation happen as freely as possible you know that that subsidize that proliferation or

532
01:51:24,240 --> 01:51:30,080
or kind of set it on a trajectory to kind of happen as quickly as possible um that that might be

533
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,640
something that kind of creates value will that creates value for for the community

534
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:45,360
all right let's dig into some of these things let's say I don't own a noun right because the

535
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:53,280
nouns holders how many nouns are there today uh let's see where are we today um today is uh

536
01:51:53,280 --> 01:52:00,000
484 I think there's some pretty big holders right so how many how many addresses hold an

537
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:05,280
noun maybe a couple hundred something like that yeah I think a number of unique holders is about

538
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:09,760
50% of the total supply I believe somewhere around there okay so let's say a couple of hundred

539
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:19,360
so there's 8 million people in the world 200 out of noun for the 7.999 billion people who don't

540
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:27,600
own a noun why should they go help the nouns become more valuable which is the thesis yeah sure

541
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:33,760
so I mean I um I think there's a few different things to talk about here right um and and I

542
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:40,960
think the the reason it's sort of like unintuitive to talk about these things is um partly because of

543
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:47,600
the the kind of initial set of conventions that the NFT community has adopted um you know one

544
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:54,800
one is one of those conventions is that like um NFT ownership is this kind of like one to one premise

545
01:52:54,800 --> 01:53:00,320
right like you have one individual and one owner right that um communities for example

546
01:53:00,960 --> 01:53:06,560
won't eventually own uh individual NFTs which which I think they will so I think you know it's

547
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:11,920
kind of a false premise in the first place to to say that because there are only um you know

548
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:17,680
400 nouns um there can only be 400 owners I think in the very long term you know it becomes

549
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:23,440
actually much more interesting than you know 8 billion nouns if if you know thousands and thousands

550
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:29,520
of people are are kind of um not forced but like um kind of encouraged by the protocol to to

551
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:34,400
kind of coordinate their ownership of of a single noun and to operate that vote so I think that

552
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:38,480
that's one way you can think about it you know the the other way you can think about it is that um

553
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:46,160
like if you look at kind of traditional traditional brands um or or sort of like traditional

554
01:53:46,160 --> 01:53:53,040
media properties the kind of like the ownership of the IP and um the the sort of like fandom of the

555
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:59,680
IP are rarely the same thing right like every every Mickey Mouse fan is not like an owner of

556
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:06,480
Disney equity right um there's there's kind of a relationship between owning the Disney

557
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:12,160
equity and uh being a Mickey Mouse fan which is like there's a sense in which owning the equity

558
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:22,480
kind of like seeks rent on on on the fandom um but I I think um that can be very very fluid right

559
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:27,920
it's it's it's possible that people can be fans of of nouns and and fans of kind of like what the

560
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:35,120
protocol gets gets up to without owning uh owning a noun it's possible that they they can kind of

561
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:41,760
unlike the case of Disney they can actually just use the IP and kind of monetize it for themselves

562
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:46,560
right and in that sense the IP sort of like seeks less rent on the fandom because the fans can

563
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:51,840
just make their own merch and and kind of make make their own stuff um I hope in the long run

564
01:54:51,840 --> 01:54:59,360
you know it um the the the sort of cost of ownership um for for kind of participating um in in

565
01:54:59,360 --> 01:55:05,120
in ownership uh drop significantly right such such that a fan that has five dollars could own like

566
01:55:05,120 --> 01:55:11,920
you know point zero zero zero one percent of of a noun and and you know consequently get to

567
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:17,680
participate in in kind of governance decisions around around the protocol um so you know I I

568
01:55:17,680 --> 01:55:23,040
think there's sort of a lot of subtleties here that um will in the long run inform the relationship

569
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:29,360
between ownership and fandom and that these things are not as as kind of like vanilla as as the

570
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:36,720
NFT space has has led them uh has sort of led people to believe they are so if that's the case

571
01:55:36,720 --> 01:55:44,800
right if people get together and buy a noun collectively does it suggest that the nouns become

572
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:54,000
more like general brands less your identity right because it seems hard to me let's say

573
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:59,520
ten thousand people each shipped in five bucks and we bought now three thousand two hundred and

574
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:07,840
seventy two I've very early on I tried to see what it was like on the fractalization side I think

575
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:15,280
I bought sixty ape tokens one of the fungapes is fractalized and I'll be honest I didn't feel the

576
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:25,280
same connection as when I owned a punk directly right like one one I felt like I own an identity uh I

577
01:56:25,280 --> 01:56:32,640
had the sense of ownership when I owned an ERC twenty token a fungible token that was

578
01:56:33,200 --> 01:56:39,440
x percent of a punk ape maybe it's an investment maybe it's about investment but I didn't I

579
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:46,000
said I don't have these identity feelings right and so given how few nouns there are given that

580
01:56:46,000 --> 01:57:00,480
you're saying people should or might collectively control them does it mean that the nouns are

581
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:12,080
less apfp identity type uh NFT and something all different how should we think about that yeah

582
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:20,160
I mean it's a good question I you know I think again it kind of it the I think it's there's a

583
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:28,720
sense in which the early history of the NFT space is probably responsible for you know the sub-optimal

584
01:57:28,720 --> 01:57:33,200
experience that you had with with the ape ownership I think there are sort of much more interesting

585
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,040
design decisions that can be made around collective ownership you know if we just wanted to

586
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:44,400
brainstorm a few with with respect to nouns like you you could look at the noun that that I have

587
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:53,120
right now and you could imagine that that it is sort of the the pfp or the flag for a community

588
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:59,520
um but that community members would have a certain freedom to kind of interpret how they relate

589
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,920
to that flag right so maybe everyone in the community has the same glasses but a different head

590
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:08,560
or we all have the same shirts or we all use the horse head and we dress it up differently um there

591
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:15,040
there's a kind of um uh it kind of experimental protocol that's being built on top of nouns

592
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:21,120
right now called composables um which which kind of proposes building a kind of market marketplace

593
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:29,040
uh for for traits for nouns um so that you could you could kind of apply those traits to the pfp

594
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:33,920
so I think there again there's there's all sorts of room for for nuance and and for builders to

595
01:58:33,920 --> 01:58:38,960
to create kind of interesting experiences around collective ownership uh and I think a lot of

596
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:44,080
those don't exist today so I I do think ultimately it's just very interesting to think about a noun

597
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:48,960
as representing a community rather than an individual with kind of lots of room for individual

598
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:55,200
expression um you know uh within the context of that community or or kind of within the context

599
01:58:55,200 --> 01:59:00,160
of of the noun as as the flag for the community yeah this makes sense to me and I think that

600
01:59:00,160 --> 01:59:06,480
is what I was trying to get up and though given the structure of nouns specifically how few

601
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:16,480
there are right just not that many nouns it is one so some people some noun or g's in the future

602
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:22,480
they'll be noun or g's might actually own a whole noun right is that that's going to be a thing

603
01:59:22,480 --> 01:59:27,280
like oh I don't know a whole noun it's like you own a whole bitcoin like that type of logic and

604
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:34,720
but many of them might be like a symbol for a guild or a community something like that is

605
01:59:34,720 --> 01:59:39,600
that a right good way to think about them yeah I think that's right and again I think there's

606
01:59:39,600 --> 01:59:45,600
there's very very little correlation between like um you know whole numbers in the money supply and

607
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:54,800
uh like you know the cap of possible participants within within a community um you know this idea

608
01:59:54,800 --> 02:00:00,960
that these things are are kind of like directly correlated I do think it's like a product of

609
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:07,200
of just how early it is you can you can certainly imagine and like it's hard to imagine

610
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:14,640
um creating like okay so I would ask how do you how could you if you wanted to to create like

611
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:20,880
one instance of an NFT for everyone in the world you know you you can't today create a kind of

612
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,960
PFP collection you know that that like let's eight eight billion people buy in you know nobody wants

613
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:31,600
to kind of participate in a community at the moment where where you know the the money supplies

614
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:36,160
that inflated um so I think I think you just have to think about like how do you how would it be

615
02:00:36,160 --> 02:00:42,720
possible to scale any one of these communities um um to kind of maximize participation and also just

616
02:00:42,720 --> 02:00:49,520
have like a sort of seen money supply and I think like the only reasonable answer is that over time

617
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:54,720
people will have to kind of figure out how to divide up the money supply such that more and more

618
02:00:54,720 --> 02:01:01,680
people can participate okay I think I think that's clear let's talk about royalties because that

619
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:13,680
is a very hot topic today and the space is divided I think um some exchanges and said look we're

620
02:01:13,680 --> 02:01:19,520
not going to order or honor artists royalties or we'll make it optional which I think is more or

621
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:28,320
less the same thing um some I think long time crypto people say like well yeah this is obvious

622
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:34,480
of course this is how it's going to end up like anything else is naive some artists saying well

623
02:01:34,480 --> 02:01:42,480
this is kind of ridiculous like I part of what I signed up for when I minted this piece was

624
02:01:43,600 --> 02:01:50,240
I'm minting it a surprise and this is the expectation this was that the royalty was part of that

625
02:01:50,240 --> 02:01:57,120
price it was part of the deal and then I guess there's this third point of view that it's kind of

626
02:01:57,120 --> 02:02:00,880
wide and top technical but it'll be kind of weird to say like hey you can do whatever we want

627
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:08,320
on Ethereum but the only thing we can't do is have a royalty right I think it seems conceptually

628
02:02:08,320 --> 02:02:13,120
weird for permission the system right and we must have the technical issues right it's not

629
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:18,720
a technical question it's kind of a philosophical question where are you on this right where are

630
02:02:18,720 --> 02:02:23,840
you on this topic obviously nouns do not have royalties how do you feel about royalties in general

631
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:29,520
is it different for pfp is it different for one art is it anyway are they anyway doomed should

632
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:36,320
people think about organizing themselves not to expect royalties what's your view yeah sure so I

633
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:42,640
mean obviously it's it's a very kind of controversial topic and and maybe rightly so because people

634
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:47,120
have have this idea that you know they're kind of future earning power is is kind of like wrapped

635
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:54,240
up in their ability to to collect royalties so I I respect you know that the conversation gets

636
02:02:54,240 --> 02:03:00,480
very heated when discussing it now I try to take like a maybe like a sort of first principles

637
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:09,920
approach in thinking about it and the way I think about it is that like artists or kind of NFT

638
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:17,280
creators if you if you if you start from the premise that that these are are kind of social tokens

639
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:27,440
right artists and and kind of creators of NFTs mentors of NFTs already just have a tremendous kind

640
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:35,280
of amount of of kind of power in the relationship between artist and collector or you know

641
02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:42,080
mentor and owner that never existed before and that power is that that you know they have the

642
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:49,680
final say in it over the money supply now I mean you can you can kind of carve out things like

643
02:03:49,680 --> 02:03:54,240
nouns where where we try to kind of get around that problem by by making the the sort of money

644
02:03:54,240 --> 02:04:00,560
supply algorithmic but you know like most of I think the most interesting conversation about royalties

645
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:06,000
is around kind of individual creators right and and their relationship with royalties and so I

646
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:12,960
think I think what's kind of misunderstood with respect to this topic is is just like how much

647
02:04:12,960 --> 02:04:18,480
power artists have with respect to the money supply right they they they can create a new piece

648
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:24,640
and inflate the money supply kind of arbitrarily at any time if the thing that is being kind of

649
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:30,240
purchased by collectors is provenance it doesn't matter if you know the the the pieces in the same

650
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:37,120
collection as the last collection you know that if it's the artist's first token or 70 a token like

651
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:43,440
none of that matters the point is that it sort of every time that that kind of creator creates new

652
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:49,360
work they're they're kind of inflating the money supply of of the social token and that and

653
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:55,360
that gives them just a tremendous amount of kind of leverage and and frankly earning power right

654
02:04:55,360 --> 02:05:00,880
that in my view means that they shouldn't also need to sort of tax the transactions that that

655
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:07,200
happen within their own economy and and I think ultimately that that's sort of what what royalties

656
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:13,520
are in more practical terms I think I think royalties are are just kind of make for poor incentive

657
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:21,360
alignment because what what they sort of incentivize for the artist is is more volatility because

658
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:27,600
every time people want to buy and sell that that artist's work that artists collects a royalty

659
02:05:27,600 --> 02:05:34,000
so like you know in any one of these communities the the community the the the kind of individuals

660
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,760
that are are collecting the royalty sort of benefit from volatility and that doesn't doesn't

661
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:47,120
seem like you know like a sustainable kind of long-term trajectory trajectory so no I I think like

662
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:55,200
the the fact that you can just like creators can create new work and and sort of dilute the money

663
02:05:55,200 --> 02:06:00,560
supply at any time gives them a tremendous amount of earning power and we've already seen evidence

664
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:10,480
of that right you know like some of these like X copy open editions I believe that was one of

665
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:23,360
the art blocks creators recently you know made like 12 million dollars or something in a day by

666
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:31,360
creating new work I just don't see the need for kind of taxing the money supply as as like an

667
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:41,760
additional mechanism for for for income when it creates so many kind of undesirable effect does

668
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:48,400
you're basically saying artists can monetize to additional primary sales and then what would

669
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:54,880
you say to an artist that said oh look you just you mentioned X copy you mentioned Tyler Hobbs

670
02:06:54,880 --> 02:07:03,200
okay fine I mean I'm pretty sure under all scenarios of any scenario of the world X copy and

671
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:11,040
Tyler Hobbs are of course perfectly capable of monetizing their reputation any point in time

672
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:16,640
because their reputation is stellar they're the top of their field but a lot of artists struggle

673
02:07:16,640 --> 02:07:22,640
to make primary sales right and they're saying well maybe this doesn't apply in the same way to

674
02:07:22,640 --> 02:07:29,600
me how should they think about it how should they organize themselves if I mean I think in a sense

675
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:34,880
what we're saying here is that like successful people make lots of money and unsuccessful people

676
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:43,120
won't you know like I think like the the sort of structure I described is like kind of holds

677
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,920
in all cases right like if you're successful at making primary sales you you would probably

678
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:54,800
make a lot of royalties and if you're unsuccessful at making primary sales you probably you probably

679
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:59,840
also wouldn't wouldn't make a lot of royalties I think the reality is that you know this this is

680
02:08:02,240 --> 02:08:08,480
the cost of producing NFTs is very low this is it is a very very competitive marketplace

681
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:16,240
and and it's it's an entrepreneurial marketplace you know just like YouTube was and is just like

682
02:08:16,240 --> 02:08:24,800
a lot of other sorts of markets are and and you know I think it's a sad reality but the fact is

683
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:32,480
that not everyone's going to make it the people that do make it if if they those people that do

684
02:08:32,480 --> 02:08:36,720
make it could monetize with royalties they can also monetize with with primary sales and I think

685
02:08:36,720 --> 02:08:40,880
they can they can do that better and if you if you can't make it with primary sales it seems

686
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:45,600
very unlikely to me that royalties would help the only scenario that that this actually captures is

687
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:53,920
this scenario where you like for example you create a lot of early work and then for some reason

688
02:08:53,920 --> 02:08:57,920
you're unable to produce additional work and people discover your early work and it becomes

689
02:08:57,920 --> 02:09:04,880
tremendously valuable and you sort of have have no way to kind of monetize what you did in the past

690
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:08,400
I mean the way to defend against that is is sort of like keep some NFTs for yourself

691
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:15,120
um that that's that's one possible solution but you know the the royalties in this case really

692
02:09:15,120 --> 02:09:21,040
cover just a very narrow set of circumstances that that I don't think like everyone

693
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:42,480
on average should be designing for okay next perfect sense let me ask you you mentioned the word

694
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:47,120
social token sometimes social currency what do you mean by that

695
02:09:47,120 --> 02:09:57,840
I mean I I think largely that's what NFTs are um you know they again all of this is sort of

696
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:05,680
happening um in the context of of blockchains in the context of like the world kind of moving from

697
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:15,040
governments having a monopoly on on money to kind of individuals and kind of entrepreneurs

698
02:10:15,040 --> 02:10:21,200
and communities being able to create their own currencies and I think there's a very real sense in

699
02:10:21,200 --> 02:10:27,440
which you know these these kind of artists one one of ones that that these are that these are

700
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:33,760
kind of artists artists currencies or social currencies for individuals you know and there's

701
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:38,080
lots of evidence for this right like if you look at this sort of like correlation between

702
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:45,280
and of social media success and uh and kind of NFT value um you know I I think um it's kind of evidence

703
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:52,720
that that what is being bought and sold in a sense is is attention and attention kind of as it relates

704
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:59,840
to an individual so I do think you know that that's a reasonably good model for for looking at

705
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:05,760
what is happening in the space you know we're moving from a world where you know governments

706
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:15,520
create currencies that kind of look and act in like pretty boring sort of uh objects and artists

707
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:21,600
are are creating currencies that look and act in much more interesting ways and there's some

708
02:11:21,600 --> 02:11:27,360
small level of adoption happening where people are willing to kind of use these as as

709
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:32,240
stores of value and use them to transact and use them to to you know do social signaling all

710
02:11:32,240 --> 02:11:39,040
sorts of other things um and that that that's really to a large extent what what we're we're

711
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:46,000
witnessing in the NFT space so I was having this discussion with Vincent Vandell and

712
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:55,120
he had the following concern about this terminology under a nor it's very clear that if you make a

713
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:59,200
piece of one of one art which a lot of what artists think they're doing right they're making one of one

714
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:05,440
art this is not anything that has any regulatory implications right like it's protected by the

715
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:10,800
first amendment it's obviously not a security ex copy makes a piece of digital art

716
02:12:15,440 --> 02:12:23,040
Vincent this is no different than someone meant to you know painting a painting and selling it

717
02:12:23,040 --> 02:12:27,760
no one has ever crossed their mind that these things might be securities if we start saying

718
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:34,080
all other currencies there competing with other currencies or financial instruments would have you

719
02:12:34,080 --> 02:12:43,600
do we risk either mischaracterizing them to our detriment or people start doing things with them

720
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:52,320
that then end up edging more towards the regulated financial services side of crypto and

721
02:12:52,320 --> 02:13:00,000
all of a sudden something that as far as I can tell should have no no regulatory implications for

722
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:05,280
an artist minting a photograph right if they're doing the social currency and do I don't know

723
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:10,240
what it would be something that looks more like an American security all of a sudden we get back

724
02:13:10,240 --> 02:13:15,840
into the world of registration and as you see it what have you is there what's your view on this

725
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:23,200
yeah I mean I don't think I have a super strong view because I just don't have a lot of

726
02:13:23,200 --> 02:13:31,440
expertise in that domain I would like my intuition is that one like what what we call them

727
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:38,320
doesn't really matter you know in the long run they either are or they're not securities financial

728
02:13:38,320 --> 02:13:47,920
assets what you know what whatever I mean I think you know outside of the outside of the context

729
02:13:47,920 --> 02:13:54,080
of like you know how regulators look at them I think that they are completely new things you know

730
02:13:54,080 --> 02:14:00,800
that have they have properties of many different things and that it's generally overly simplistic

731
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:09,360
to think of them as you know A or B or X or Y like there are many things simultaneously and

732
02:14:09,360 --> 02:14:14,320
that's what makes them interesting I also think the sort of long-term trajectory of this space is

733
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:20,800
probably some some sort of like revolutionary type confrontation with regulators with with

734
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:26,240
governments because it just seems inevitable to me that you know that that one of the most

735
02:14:26,240 --> 02:14:31,520
powerful things that the technology does is it it kind of democratizes the ability to create

736
02:14:31,520 --> 02:14:37,360
currency and when that kind of butts up against you know the government's sort of ability to monopolize

737
02:14:37,360 --> 02:14:44,480
currency that it's going to be confrontational so I think that sort of confrontation is inevitable

738
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:50,800
no matter what we call these things and you know we should do them the service of naming them the

739
02:14:50,800 --> 02:14:57,280
thing that describes them best versus kind of trying trying to be dishonest about it for for fear

740
02:14:57,280 --> 02:15:02,320
of of how regulators will look at them we we've already seen sort of like the negative implications

741
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:06,960
of of that with respect to governments governance tokens and people being kind of intellectually

742
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:12,080
dishonest about about like what what things are so I think it's just good to call them what they are

743
02:15:12,080 --> 02:15:20,160
okay I think that's a fair fair question let me a fair answer let me ask you this it's 20 years

744
02:15:20,160 --> 02:15:30,480
from now now and so right about minting now 7300 or something that's where we'll be in 20 years

745
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:40,800
in your best case outcome vision of what 20 years from now the future looks like for

746
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:50,560
knowledge and the picture what what does it look like yeah so I think the most interesting case

747
02:15:50,560 --> 02:15:56,720
for nouns in the very long term is is that they emerge as something like the first network state

748
02:15:56,720 --> 02:16:04,080
you know they each noun becomes a very kind of large community of its own and that you know

749
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:10,000
that the nouns down the kind of organization that that glues them all together is the meta-organization

750
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:15,280
you know it's it's kind of like the the UN or you know it's the body where they all kind of coordinate

751
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:21,760
the activity between you know these very very large internet communities I think in that scenario

752
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:28,400
you know the the treasury that that these communities have access to is quite large probably

753
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:33,440
measured in the tens or hundreds of billions and that this this treasury can be used to to kind

754
02:16:33,440 --> 02:16:40,640
of at this time go well beyond proliferating the meme and and start being used to actually build

755
02:16:40,640 --> 02:16:44,640
public infrastructure to build public goods and you know we we already do this at a very small

756
02:16:45,440 --> 02:16:53,760
scale but you know I I think there um the optionality kind of exists within the structure

757
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:59,120
for this to emerge it's it's very early and there's a lot of work that we have to do

758
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:06,240
um towards that goal um and and you know as with any sort of crypto it's all very risky and novel

759
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:10,560
and there's lots of things that could go go wrong on the way but I think in the case where everything

760
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:16,560
goes right and in the case where you know the internet sort of continues to to become more important

761
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:22,080
and blockchains kind of continue to become more important as the as the way we we govern how the

762
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:27,520
world works I think it would be very very interesting if nouns or something like nouns

763
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:35,440
uh emerged as as one of the key pieces of of governance infrastructure and public goods funding

764
02:17:35,440 --> 02:17:39,920
and that that got linked back to the world and and could do a whole bunch of good there um that

765
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:42,160
that's kind of the most exciting vision I can think of for the project

766
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:48,960
you had tweeted something I think a few days ago then every time someone

767
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:55,120
talks about the book value of the treasury you wanted to give a million dollars the treasure away

768
02:17:55,120 --> 02:18:01,040
something something along those lines if and now you're saying about the treasury being for

769
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:10,240
public goods how should noun holders think about the treasure is it something like it's end

770
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:15,600
endowment of a not for profit and they need to be used just to promote nouns and then along

771
02:18:15,600 --> 02:18:22,160
with other public goods it's not and by extension it's not something say oh look we have this

772
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:27,920
pile of leaflets pay ourselves a dividend is is that what was implied in that book value

773
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:39,040
treat yeah I mean um I I think on on on my twitter and and just generally I'm very kind of public

774
02:18:39,040 --> 02:18:45,360
in in kind of working through uh these problems in my own head I I don't know that that this was

775
02:18:45,360 --> 02:18:51,200
any sort of definitive statement about how uh how the treasury should be used it it was really

776
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:56,000
just largely how I was feeling at the moment that you know my my personal sense and again you

777
02:18:56,000 --> 02:19:02,080
know I'm I guess there's there's a sense in which I'm maybe a spiritual leader of the community

778
02:19:02,080 --> 02:19:07,200
but there's also a sense in which I can be very wrong and I'm also you know my my only kind of hard

779
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:13,520
power here is the number of of noun votes that I have which is you know I'm not I'm not even close

780
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:19,120
to the largest holder um and and so you know it I think in that moment I was feeling like

781
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:26,880
um as a community we we had had sort of  stopped being as aggressive as we were with with

782
02:19:26,880 --> 02:19:30,720
funding public goods and kind of funding charitable endeavors which I think for a whole bunch

783
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:33,840
of other reasons that we haven't discussed is like something that's very very important for

784
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:40,400
for crypto and blockchains to do um so I I was just kind of vocalizing um you know I I guess maybe

785
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:47,120
in the way I do sometimes very strongly my my opinion that um you know we we we could move back

786
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:54,480
in in that direction um but you know I I think it's ultimately up to uh all all noun holders to

787
02:19:54,480 --> 02:19:58,720
to kind of collectively figure out what it is the project should do I think the thing that makes

788
02:19:58,720 --> 02:20:03,360
it interesting is that it's permissionless um and and the thing that makes it interesting is that

789
02:20:03,360 --> 02:20:09,280
it's it's the competing visions of of of all the owners and all of the members you know it um that

790
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:14,000
that determine what the organization will do you know I I think you can really think about the

791
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,200
kind of disbursement of the treasury as sort of like a function right and that function like the

792
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:29,920
the thing it reacts to is is sort of like the overlapping area as of of all of the venn diagrams

793
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:34,720
of of of of all of the owners and and what they want to do there's that space in the middle where

794
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:39,920
we all agree that that this is something valuable and and and and the treasury is like a function

795
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:44,160
that that executes that thing um so I I mean I think that that's probably the right way to think

796
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:49,760
about it long term um and then you know I I I continued to kind of inject my opinion as opinions as

797
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:57,280
as they kind of uh form okay and then I think not exactly related but sort of related

798
02:20:59,280 --> 02:21:04,480
you're in the process I guess it has been decided to do something that I believe to most

799
02:21:04,480 --> 02:21:11,920
projects would be inconceivable which is you're going to delete the discord and the logic

800
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:21,920
if I understood it correctly was to to theories one theory is in time of bounds becomes super

801
02:21:21,920 --> 02:21:28,800
successful that official discord is going to be very powerful ground I guess I kind of what

802
02:21:28,800 --> 02:21:37,280
happened with bitcoin dot com and uh uh in the bitcoin area are so yeah right and so it's

803
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:45,840
going to be fine our bitcoin and it's going to be fought over and maybe not in a way that aligns

804
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:51,360
with the real project who gets to run that discord what views happen in that discord and then

805
02:21:51,360 --> 02:21:59,840
you also said something that like the mix of people who were involved for culture and development

806
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:08,240
versus for financial purposes in a way the discord management is a subsidy from those involved

807
02:22:08,240 --> 02:22:14,320
in the culture and operations to those who are just in it for financial return how do how do

808
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:18,560
we think about that and I guess the discord is going away is that is the decision been made

809
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:23,600
yeah that's right so uh how Halloween October 31st will be the last last day of the

810
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:29,760
quote unquote official nouns discord and again you know I think a lot of my public comments are

811
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:37,040
me me trying to work through a lot of these things in in my head um I you know I I think the

812
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:43,120
I think the reality is that it as as quote unquote neutral territory it already was being

813
02:22:43,120 --> 02:22:47,520
fought over it was being fought over in in very subtle ways but you know that I think that dynamic

814
02:22:47,520 --> 02:22:55,440
already did exist and and yeah I think it was just ultimately something that um again in these

815
02:22:55,440 --> 02:23:01,920
very nuanced ways was was kind of unhealthy for for the community and and making it a less fun

816
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:07,280
and productive place to be than than it otherwise was and otherwise would be um and I think yeah

817
02:23:07,280 --> 02:23:15,840
the the the factors that there are already um dozens if not more um uh discussion forums where

818
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:21,440
you know there's there's like very interesting and productive discussion that is taking place

819
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:27,520
about nouns and those spaces have points of view and so they're not fought over right they don't

820
02:23:27,520 --> 02:23:32,160
they don't pretend to be neutral um and it's just a much more healthy and productive thing for the

821
02:23:32,160 --> 02:23:37,120
community to kind of disperse into those spaces and then ultimately for us to to kind of come back

822
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:44,560
and meet on chain uh and and really have have our discussions um about the governance of the protocol

823
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:52,880
in a place where um those discussions have like weight where they have meaning right where where like

824
02:23:52,880 --> 02:23:59,360
um in in in essence these votes um are a place where where kind of like words and actions are the

825
02:23:59,360 --> 02:24:03,920
same thing or or these proposals are a place where words and actions are the same thing um and

826
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:08,560
that is not necessarily happening in the discord you know I think I think if you if you sort of like

827
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:13,520
just looked into the discord and and tried to take the temperature in there based on on the

828
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:17,840
discussion that was happening as to whether we should shut down the discord or not you know you

829
02:24:17,840 --> 02:24:22,000
you would have had an intuitive sense that people were kind of overwhelmingly against it

830
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:28,480
but on on you know the noun owners call when when someone kind of like took the temperature of

831
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:35,680
of actual owners um I think the uh uh the vote was um you know it was it was a smaller call but

832
02:24:35,680 --> 02:24:40,960
the the vote was like you know something like 20 to four uh in in favor of shutting it down

833
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:46,640
so again this this is the way in which the uh the the supposedly neutral space can become

834
02:24:46,640 --> 02:24:53,360
contested right and like obviously the people that um kind of benefit the most from taking over

835
02:24:53,360 --> 02:24:57,840
that neutral space would be would be in favor of keeping it um and and so you you can see there's

836
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:02,800
kind of hard evidence right there that that this is an unhealthy unhealthy kind of dynamic for the

837
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:06,800
community so I think it's ultimately a great thing that we're shutting it down you know and I

838
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:13,600
I think ultimately if if the protocol can't survive um the the the end of a single discord server

839
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:18,640
then then it doesn't really deserve to survive so I you know I I think it is quite quite robust

840
02:25:18,640 --> 02:25:23,520
in certain ways and and we're we're already seeing just like a lot of a lot of new discords popping

841
02:25:23,520 --> 02:25:28,560
up and a lot of more interesting conversations happening so I I do think ultimately we'll look

842
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:36,160
back and see that it was the right move okay it's taken up a lot of your time so we're gonna end

843
02:25:36,160 --> 02:25:42,000
with one question which is what's the question that I should have asked but didn't ask

844
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:45,920
what's the thing that you'd like to close on and the thing that we we didn't cover but I should

845
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:55,040
have asked that we should have covered um I'd say maybe just with with respect to the cc zero stuff

846
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:04,320
like I think a lot of the conversation um always kind of revolves around ownership and licenses

847
02:26:04,320 --> 02:26:10,080
and you know what's right and what's wrong I think one of the thing that things that's like really

848
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:19,360
frequently neglected is just like how awesome remix culture is um you know but but like

849
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:24,800
certainly at the at the peak of like the NFT frenzy you know people were just doing so many cool

850
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:29,040
things with punks like remixing them and all sorts of fun and interesting ways and that that

851
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:34,320
remix culture uh in in the nouns community is super super strong and and people are always making just

852
02:26:34,320 --> 02:26:38,800
like incredible things and I think this sort of remix culture is just very very native to the

853
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:45,840
internet it's just like it's it's a it's a place where people want to take things and synthesize them

854
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:51,680
and and you know uh have fun with them and play with them and proliferate them so I I think maybe

855
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:58,720
like the the most important reason um to be kind of bullish on on cc zero it is that you know and

856
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:03,920
and if he's actually allowed this sort of remix culture to be monetized uh in in ways that are

857
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:10,720
going to produce like really really fun and and refreshing and and in great culture um so I

858
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:16,000
think it's it's really important not to lose sight of that uh I couldn't agree more and in some

859
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:23,600
ways it's interesting and we have just not gotten the story yeah as a field the idea that

860
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:33,440
a collector is willing to spend money to in effect keep artists working and then also at the

861
02:27:33,440 --> 02:27:39,920
same time make that art available to the global public commons seems like literally the best case

862
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:46,400
outcome for the world of large right literally something that people should be very happy about and

863
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:53,760
that message hasn't gotten out I mean but people who are not into the NFT space and sometimes they

864
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:59,680
argue with me on twitter and I try to be helpful and they say well I mean just you don't know

865
02:27:59,680 --> 02:28:05,760
anything right that's just the kind of thing and kind of my view is like what are you doing if I'm

866
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:14,080
happy owning a token or a piece of art that cc zero who's the victim here I mean the artist has

867
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:22,320
gotten money for their work literally the rest of the planet has this art to play with and for some

868
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:28,640
reason then a rich collector is the victim who's the actual victim I'm the victim I show you

869
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:34,320
I'm not the victim and if I'm not the victim what's the victim of this and but people struggle it

870
02:28:34,320 --> 02:28:39,920
struggle with it I think and I think it doesn't mean all art should be cc zero right people should

871
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:45,040
each artist should use whatever license they want but cc zero art I think does have the

872
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:53,840
dynamic that in effect everyone I think is winning and I don't see who's possibly losing and so

873
02:28:54,640 --> 02:29:01,680
we probably agree on this is that fair yeah yeah I agree very strongly you know I think one one

874
02:29:01,680 --> 02:29:07,200
interesting way to frame it and and I think I have to run in a minute so I don't have time to get

875
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:15,200
into it but I think the two like two of the killer apps of blockchains are NFTs and public goods

876
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:20,720
and and the kind of the intersection between those things is just very very fruitful

877
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:27,600
fruitful space and and I think thinking about the cc zero conversation in that context

878
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:35,600
it is maybe a really nice way to think about it and and kind of leads you to to a lot of these

879
02:29:35,600 --> 02:29:43,360
conclusions okay well thank you again so much for your time this was excellent and look forward

880
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:49,360
to seeing what happens in the mountains ecosystem as things evolve yeah thank you and really looking

881
02:29:49,360 --> 02:29:55,200
forward to the kind of Q&A that's a response to to this conversation so thanks again for having

882
02:29:55,200 --> 02:30:06,640
me this is a lot of fun

883
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:22,800
hi everyone I thought that was a great session and very generously 4156

884
02:30:22,800 --> 02:30:27,440
I can stay a few minutes now post a session and answer some of your questions

885
02:30:27,440 --> 02:30:36,240
4156 are you there can you hear us yeah here good morning how are you great great I am

886
02:30:36,240 --> 02:30:42,320
mostly going to stay out of this because I think this people want to hear from you I think some

887
02:30:42,320 --> 02:30:50,720
people some questions will be put here in the chat in the chat in the studio where we are

888
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:59,360
and what I'd like to ask people to do is also post their questions now in the on chat and then

889
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:06,240
some of the team members will try and feed them up here and I'll only intervene if we get confused

890
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:11,840
otherwise I mean I think the floor is yours 4156 and there's a couple of I think fairly straightforward

891
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:16,160
questions to start with and we'll see what else we got sure sorry so you want me to read the

892
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:22,000
questions or you're going to you're going to curate them in the region I think you can just read them

893
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:27,440
as little as you like okay sure I see two two questions here correct and I'm going to go look for more

894
02:31:27,440 --> 02:31:37,120
we're going to see what else is out there okay all right so I'm just going to review some talk I guess

895
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:45,120
it's kind of hard to get a sense of what the feedback is but we'll give this a try okay so

896
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:51,680
question 4156 is the revenue of the noun staff shared among the founders in the no so safe only

897
02:31:51,680 --> 02:32:00,160
or is it also shared with the community so there is there is no no so safe the nouns now is kind

898
02:32:00,160 --> 02:32:11,120
of an instance of compound governance so 100% of the auction proceeds when when somebody buys a

899
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:20,000
noun flow into the Dow so the the founders actually receive none of that what the founders do get

900
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:26,000
is every 10th noun for the first five years of the project so if you go and you watch the

901
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:34,160
noun options you know when you get to noun I don't know 419 you'll notice that noun 420

902
02:32:34,160 --> 02:32:39,920
isn't actually option just sent directly to the founders of the project and then the option

903
02:32:39,920 --> 02:32:48,160
skips to now 421 so 100% of the proceeds go into the Dow zero to the founders what the founders

904
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:53,760
get is is every 10th noun for the first five years and after that that kind of quote unquote

905
02:32:53,760 --> 02:33:00,880
nounters reward is is finished the founders aren't capturing anymore sort of value from from

906
02:33:00,880 --> 02:33:08,560
the project and 100% of the proceeds go to the Dow 0.456 if I have a noun what are the expected

907
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:14,320
utilities apart from the voting right I'm sorry this moved and the potential price upside of

908
02:33:14,320 --> 02:33:21,440
the noun NFT I owned if I only have one noun and I'm not selling is is is it only the voting

909
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:28,800
right I get yeah so I mean I think the interesting thing about nouns is that probably unlike most

910
02:33:28,800 --> 02:33:37,600
other NFT projects all of the value is created by the community so so you know in essence like

911
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:43,440
when you ask the question what what do I get the answer is really you know what whatever it is

912
02:33:43,440 --> 02:33:49,280
that you're sort of willing to contribute and and you know the the net benefit of all all the

913
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:56,640
other the contributions of the of the other noun owners and and whatever one sort of collectively

914
02:33:56,640 --> 02:34:02,880
decides to do with the treasury you know and in in in literal terms what what you're getting is

915
02:34:02,880 --> 02:34:08,960
you're you're getting the NFT and the NFT lets you have one vote kind of to to help direct the

916
02:34:08,960 --> 02:34:16,720
treasury you know everything else by design is kind of as open as possible so you know this is

917
02:34:16,720 --> 02:34:23,680
really sort of bullish on the notion of NFTs as digital originals so you sort of own the

918
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:29,600
provenance of of you know a real noun and an OG noun you know to the extent that you think

919
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:35,520
that token on its own is valuable independent of any sort of like you know IP rights or or you

920
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:41,760
know discord rights or anything else kind of conferred upon you you know and most of those things

921
02:34:41,760 --> 02:34:48,960
are absent what is present is you know the ability to vote to govern the DAO and and the ownership

922
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:58,480
of of the the digital original okay I read a while back about nouns starting and nouns starter

923
02:34:58,480 --> 02:35:05,200
project for new noun style DAO's to try the experiment but with more specific goals or orientation

924
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:13,120
could you elaborate on that yeah so that project is actually coming from Jacob Horn and and

925
02:35:13,920 --> 02:35:21,520
and Zora it's called nouns builder I believe it's launching very soon you know I think I believe

926
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:25,760
they have they have a twitter that you can follow I'm not running that project or you know

927
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:32,880
haven't been following it super super closely so Jacob or nouns builder would you know that they

928
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:38,080
would be the people to kind of chat with about that but yeah you know I think this idea of sort

929
02:35:38,080 --> 02:35:45,520
of like commoditizing the you know the ability to create nounish DAO's is super interesting

930
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:50,720
and you know to the extent that we've seen a lot of success with the first instance of the model

931
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:57,520
I would expect that we'll see success with other instances of the model and of course the very

932
02:35:57,520 --> 02:36:02,240
very interesting thing is is like when all of these things are sort of networked in the long run

933
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:07,840
and and able to kind of you know vote on each other's proposals call functions on each other

934
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:15,520
I think that starts to get it and that that sort of like vision for you know like a governance

935
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:20,640
layer of of the internet or or the metaverse or whatever you want to call it in the long run I think

936
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:28,080
that's going to be super interesting that question can you show how you analyze a project

937
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:35,840
I guess that's with respect to like just discovering other NFT projects and like thinking about

938
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:41,920
are they valuable or not I mean I can I guess I can talk more generally about this and by the way

939
02:36:41,920 --> 02:36:47,680
if if that someone is out there with feedback it's still like which of these questions they want

940
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:52,880
more more time spent on just let me know I feel like I'm just kind of talking into the boy gear

941
02:36:52,880 --> 02:36:58,480
which I'm okay with but as long as this is interesting can you show how you analyze a project

942
02:36:58,480 --> 02:37:07,200
right so I mean I think maybe the the way I think about things is after a lot of years kind of

943
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:12,320
investing in financial markets like I think they're just kind of typically some signs that you can

944
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:17,280
look for that you know something a value is being created and I think this stuff is sort of

945
02:37:17,280 --> 02:37:22,880
generalizable between traditional financial markets and a few projects sort of like venture capital

946
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:30,720
I mean in general I would say that like one of the things that I use before committing capital

947
02:37:30,720 --> 02:37:41,280
or time to something is like you know am I obsessed with it I typically I'm like very very selective

948
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:48,880
about things I invest in and those things are typically also things that I'm willing to spend

949
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:56,160
a lot of time on personally you know so I don't know like just as a as an example like

950
02:37:56,160 --> 02:38:04,080
you know way back I guess several years ago now when I invested in Tesla early on you know I

951
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:08,640
like had become obsessed with the company I was like I sat in my friend's Tesla I was like you

952
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:14,720
know this is like being in a rocket ship you know I eventually bought one and you know like

953
02:38:15,360 --> 02:38:19,280
there's like a deep understanding that comes from that that sort of obsession that was true

954
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:24,960
with Bitcoin and Ethereum and true for NFTs as well so it's you know it's I think personally it's

955
02:38:24,960 --> 02:38:32,000
less about like you know kind of scouring the internet for like something that you think nobody

956
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:39,920
else has discovered yet and it's more about kind of bouncing around online until you find something

957
02:38:39,920 --> 02:38:46,160
that you become obsessed with and then you know you can eventually sort of you'll find natural

958
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:52,960
ways to monetize it if you become obsessed with it and you know sometimes those things won't

959
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:59,040
necessarily even be investible like you know if if you're like obsessed with stable diffusion right

960
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:06,480
now like maybe you could build a business around it for for example so I think you know it's really

961
02:39:06,480 --> 02:39:10,640
about being sort of selective and then about committing your time and your capital to things that

962
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:18,160
you know kind of peak your interests and where you see an awful lot of depth versus just you know

963
02:39:18,160 --> 02:39:23,520
hanging out and looking for the next board apes and you know throwing like 5% of your portfolio at each

964
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:32,800
one of these do you think it's a good idea to use the nouns governance model but for something

965
02:39:32,800 --> 02:39:38,160
unrelated to nouns generative art every day forever where that treasury is used to acquire generative art

966
02:39:38,160 --> 02:39:42,240
yeah I think so and you know maybe I just want to spend a ton of time on this one because as it relates

967
02:39:42,240 --> 02:39:51,120
to the 6529 question above you know that I think we're about to see what happens when you sort of

968
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:56,080
like generalize this infrastructure and you start forming communities with different kinds of

969
02:39:56,080 --> 02:40:01,200
objectives I would add to that like you know one of the really interesting things about the original

970
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:08,480
instance of nouns it is that it's sort of that it doesn't have an objective but that like the

971
02:40:08,480 --> 02:40:14,560
objective is sort of driven primarily by the art and the meme and the feeling of the community

972
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:20,560
so like that the objective is an emergent property I'm not sure like I think it will be interesting

973
02:40:20,560 --> 02:40:26,960
to see how it works when you know the the objective is kind of more explicitly stated at the

974
02:40:26,960 --> 02:40:32,240
outset and of course I think we're going to see a mix of these these nounish dows with with

975
02:40:32,240 --> 02:40:42,480
explicit and and then sort of emergent objectives okay next question you currently have a treasury

976
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:47,200
of approximately 30,000 teeth accrued from more than a year what are your short and long term

977
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:53,840
plans for the funds again you know I do sort of think of the dows as a function that you know

978
02:40:53,840 --> 02:41:02,880
bit based on the kind of interests of like the places where the interests of the down members

979
02:41:02,880 --> 02:41:10,960
overlap that that's kind of what the funds will be allocated for you know as as for sort of my

980
02:41:10,960 --> 02:41:17,280
own opinion you know I do think there's a sense in which like the the treasury is kind of misunderstood

981
02:41:17,280 --> 02:41:23,840
like you hear a lot of people kind of that don't know much about the project you know talk about how

982
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:27,840
you know the the the funds haven't been used yet and that's like some some sort of like horrible

983
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:34,000
misallocation you know or like they've been squandered or you know the sort of like kind of nonsense

984
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:40,160
I think you know I do think there's a sense in which the treasury is the sort of like

985
02:41:40,160 --> 02:41:48,240
um it's like the the federal reserve of the nouns right like the reserve assets aren't

986
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:55,520
necessarily there to be spent immediately what they're therefore is to kind of reinforce the

987
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:03,840
caliber or the quality or the long term nature you know or the credibility of of of the protocol

988
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:12,160
um and and you know I think yes like proposals passed that that sort of um at disperse you know

989
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:17,360
a certain percentage of of those funds every month every year but you know I I think there's

990
02:42:17,360 --> 02:42:22,160
actually a lot of value especially sort of early on in the history of this thing um to to being

991
02:42:22,160 --> 02:42:27,440
pretty conservative with how the funds are used um to you know to use them in in ways that kind

992
02:42:27,440 --> 02:42:33,520
of run experiments and and sort of further the mission of the protocol but but really um I think

993
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:40,640
there's a lot of value from um from the treasury just like sitting there at as the sort of meme and

994
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:46,480
as as the sort of gold reserves of uh of the nouns ecosystem um and so in that sense I think you know

995
02:42:46,480 --> 02:42:52,240
it like it's more of a question of like what should we do with the treasury in in 10 years when

996
02:42:52,240 --> 02:42:57,920
when it's you know um in eth terms 10x larger and in via terms you know maybe a hundred or a thousand

997
02:42:57,920 --> 02:43:02,560
x larger you know what what what are the things that we could do at that point um that that seems

998
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:10,560
like the most interesting question to me uh okay question seemed like small contradiction

999
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:20,160
um between royalties view artist control long tail of supply versus provenance value early tokens

1000
02:43:20,160 --> 02:43:35,760
matter more than trad art can you try to reconcile these okay let me think about this for a second

1001
02:43:41,120 --> 02:43:46,880
oh I see like so it's like how should artists kind of like monetize their early work

1002
02:43:46,880 --> 02:43:53,920
if if that's the most valuable stuff um yeah I mean that I guess that's an interesting point like um

1003
02:43:53,920 --> 02:43:59,680
um I mean I would just say I think there's a lot of uncertainty kind of um in both those

1004
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:04,960
perspectives so it's kind of difficult to comment on on like what should artists do in case

1005
02:44:04,960 --> 02:44:11,360
they overlap but I mean it is a valid point like if if if most of the the value kind of comes from

1006
02:44:11,360 --> 02:44:18,160
early early tokens you know um how do artists sort of monetize those I mean I you know I would say

1007
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:23,520
it's it's less about like an individual artist early tokens and more about like the the early

1008
02:44:23,520 --> 02:44:30,080
tokens of the NFT space I think kind of outside of those um you know very very early uh pieces

1009
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:38,880
um that that like you know we're minted in 2018 2019 etc like I think as you sort of move away

1010
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:46,080
from that era um it does become more kind of analogous to traditional art where it's about the

1011
02:44:46,080 --> 02:44:49,920
the value of the individual piece versus like the you know the historic value of the token

1012
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:58,000
uh what is the best strategy for nouns in terms of fast and and widely and wide massive

1013
02:44:58,000 --> 02:45:04,560
option in web 2 I mean again I think the best strategy for nouns is the strategy that the

1014
02:45:04,560 --> 02:45:09,680
community kind of agrees upon right um but the interesting thing about it is that it's it's kind

1015
02:45:09,680 --> 02:45:16,080
of like you know community created content um I will so one one of the things I was sort of uh

1016
02:45:16,080 --> 02:45:21,840
kind of alluding to at the end of uh the conversation with 6529 um was the sort of like

1017
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:30,080
importance of uh public goods funding um and and kind of you know like I think I heard somebody

1018
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:34,480
call it I think they called it like warm crypto or warm blockchain I saw that just just one

1019
02:45:34,480 --> 02:45:41,280
instance of that um but it seems like maybe a useful term you know um the this idea that um

1020
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:49,600
so okay so here's here's sort of an example right like if if if you um have right now

1021
02:45:50,480 --> 02:45:55,600
a kind of like a CO2 negative Bitcoin right we're like every block that was mined

1022
02:45:55,600 --> 02:46:02,560
um kind of removed CO2 from the atmosphere right I mean you can't do that but just imagine kind

1023
02:46:02,560 --> 02:46:09,120
of um as a thought experiment that you could you know I think you would see like kind of relative

1024
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:16,240
to um kind of traditional sort of like environmental negative externality Bitcoin you would see like

1025
02:46:16,240 --> 02:46:24,000
rapid adoption of of that version of Bitcoin right because because people sort of would collectively

1026
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:30,800
recognize that that the adoption is collectively good for the world um and and I think that sort

1027
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:37,600
of thinking with respect to crypto and blockchains is um probably super important and has been

1028
02:46:38,640 --> 02:46:44,480
kind of undervalued and and under emphasized as a tool for mass adoption so I do think that

1029
02:46:44,480 --> 02:46:54,320
this sort of like um like public goods funding as a method for proliferation and for mass adoption

1030
02:46:54,320 --> 02:46:59,200
is pretty important because I think people need to see that this technology can be used for good

1031
02:46:59,840 --> 02:47:07,520
and I think you know as as a kind of community um like the crypto space has really not

1032
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:11,920
not been created that right like the world has seen that a handful of people have gotten like

1033
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:18,560
absurdly wealthy um you know the the world has seen um you know that the huge sort of energy footprint

1034
02:47:18,560 --> 02:47:24,320
approve of work but the world hasn't really seen and you know I think up to this point we have not

1035
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:31,840
done a great job of sort of like demonstrating the value for for people that don't necessarily

1036
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:37,200
own these tokens right like what what are the positive externalities that these systems can create

1037
02:47:37,200 --> 02:47:42,720
so far they've they've sort of like hordered the profits and just it created negative externalities

1038
02:47:42,720 --> 02:47:47,920
but I think from here if we want to see mass adoption we have to we have to create sort of positive

1039
02:47:47,920 --> 02:48:07,920
externalities I think I'll in second I can I drink some water perhaps and I have a question

1040
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:12,160
but I think I heard that in exchange cannot honor royalties I presume that royalties were encoded

1041
02:48:12,160 --> 02:48:19,200
into a smart contract and were always honored what am I missing I mean I think you probably like

1042
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:24,400
a someone with more kind of deep technical expertise about ethereum can answer this better than me

1043
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:31,760
but effectively you can you can always sort of create derivatives and sort of wrapper contracts

1044
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:38,400
that allow things to happen on ethereum um in in these kind of meta contracts that don't have

1045
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:44,640
to honor the royalties that that the original contract and has created you know it it's just like

1046
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:51,120
these systems are designed to be sort of like the ultimate ultimate free market infrastructure

1047
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:57,680
and and so it's it's very difficult in that context to to enforce a very specific

1048
02:48:59,040 --> 02:49:07,360
sorts of constraints how well audited is your DAO smart contract um yeah so I mean audits are

1049
02:49:07,360 --> 02:49:13,040
obviously super super important in this space um so that the the the actual um kind of

1050
02:49:14,480 --> 02:49:18,720
governance module the infrastructure which which is you know the that's like the most critical

1051
02:49:18,720 --> 02:49:26,320
piece of nouns is is a fork of compound uh governor bravo which itself you know has has been

1052
02:49:26,960 --> 02:49:33,120
used for a long time and and undergone um uh you know significant audits and then all of the

1053
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:39,440
changes that we made to it um were audited by you know some of the best people in the space um the

1054
02:49:39,440 --> 02:49:47,040
recent kind of V2 um of nouns that that uh was just deployed um that that um improves a

1055
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:55,040
upon a a couple of of the governance mechanisms uh underwent a cotorino audit um and yeah you know

1056
02:49:55,040 --> 02:50:00,880
the the um the sort of technical nounism cells you know these are a large number of them um they're

1057
02:50:00,880 --> 02:50:07,040
they're all kind of um very very elite developers um kind of at at at the top of the field so

1058
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:16,080
you know um those those smart contracts I would say are kind of as as uh well as well scrutinized as

1059
02:50:16,080 --> 02:50:20,080
as sort of any other uh kind of critical piece of of infrastructure in this space

1060
02:50:25,120 --> 02:50:28,400
uh do you feel there are still talented people willing to build on top of collections

1061
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:33,840
as they did following your nouns tweet um or the talented ones already made it and it's just

1062
02:50:33,840 --> 02:50:38,960
as plebs left um I mean I I think that's actually a really good question especially the first half

1063
02:50:38,960 --> 02:50:44,400
of it you know if if like I created that sort of nouns tweet today you know what what would the

1064
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:51,040
response be like um and and I do think this sort of like um speaks a little bit to the value of

1065
02:50:51,040 --> 02:50:58,960
uh building and being present at in in bull markets right but like this sort of um there's the

1066
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:07,040
sort of like wild enthusiasm for trying new things in the context of of media all of that said um

1067
02:51:07,040 --> 02:51:13,440
you know I I think we were very lucky um when we all got together to build nouns that we had a

1068
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:18,880
group of people that were not concerned with kind of instantaneous monetization um and and really

1069
02:51:18,880 --> 02:51:25,360
like thinking um about building something for the long term um and and I think that you know that

1070
02:51:25,360 --> 02:51:32,320
sort of um that sort of outcome is probably much more rare that during during a bull market

1071
02:51:32,320 --> 02:51:36,720
so I think like maybe the answer is twofold like on one hand it's a lot easier to get get people

1072
02:51:36,720 --> 02:51:42,160
together to try new stuff on the other hand it's a lot more difficult and like I think we were

1073
02:51:42,160 --> 02:51:47,200
pretty lucky with respect to getting people that were willing to build for the long term you know

1074
02:51:47,200 --> 02:51:53,680
like in um in kind of measurable terms that group of people probably could have you know we could have

1075
02:51:54,320 --> 02:52:00,160
if we wanted to kind of monetize something short term in the midst of that mania you know we

1076
02:52:00,160 --> 02:52:06,320
we probably could have made tens of millions of dollars or more um by by just you know focusing

1077
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:12,640
on that objective so you know we all kind of chose to to kind of leave a lot of money on the table

1078
02:52:12,640 --> 02:52:18,000
to to try to build something interesting and kind of focused on the long term and and I think

1079
02:52:18,640 --> 02:52:22,480
it's easier to find people that are willing to do that in a bear market than a bull market

1080
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:29,520
even if it is kind of more difficult to to get them all together um are there specific ways cc 0

1081
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:35,920
artists might model their career in managed ways other than treasury for proliferation

1082
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:47,200
um other specific way cc 0 artists might model their career in managed ways other than a treasury

1083
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:56,240
for proliferation so I guess is if the question is like what are the ways that cc 0 artists can kind of

1084
02:52:56,240 --> 02:53:05,040
like monetize their work I mean I I think the answer there is like really just native to NFTs

1085
02:53:05,040 --> 02:53:14,160
like do you believe that selling digital originals it is valuable um I guess if if the question is

1086
02:53:14,160 --> 02:53:20,240
more related to setting up sort of like instances like new instances of announced out with with

1087
02:53:20,240 --> 02:53:32,000
nouns builder um I mean you know um I think that the model of kind of keeping every you know

1088
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:40,160
nth uh NFT for yourself um and letting all of the value flow to the treasury is probably

1089
02:53:40,720 --> 02:53:46,640
difficult for an artist that's starting out and it's it's probably like a structure that that's

1090
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:52,240
more well suited suited to to kind of communities that want to do work together uh question as the

1091
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:57,120
supply of nouns keeps increasing is the thesis that newer minted nouns will become less valuable

1092
02:53:57,120 --> 02:54:02,880
and the OG nouns will maintain higher value so I mean I think certainly that that's possible if

1093
02:54:02,880 --> 02:54:10,640
if the sort of like timestamp theory is correct um you know that that said I I do think you know

1094
02:54:10,640 --> 02:54:14,560
and it's sort of like difficult to speculate on on where the value will come from because again it

1095
02:54:14,560 --> 02:54:21,200
it it is really community driven um but but I do think like in in the long term um the value is

1096
02:54:21,200 --> 02:54:26,640
this sort of like combination of of provenance right like you belong to the original original

1097
02:54:26,640 --> 02:54:33,360
instance of nouns of which there are now you know hundreds of thousands of sort of like uh copies

1098
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:40,000
of that organization out in the world doing doing various things um and and um and then also sort

1099
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:44,960
of like the you know the the membership and community value you know what what does it mean to be

1100
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:52,320
to have a vote kind of um in in that in that protocol um what what does it mean to sort of be able

1101
02:54:52,320 --> 02:54:59,360
to direct that treasury uh and to have the the sort of like um status of of being being part of

1102
02:54:59,360 --> 02:55:06,800
that uh that organization um and and you know I I do think um you know people kind of frequently

1103
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:12,160
look at this idea that uh the the supply is infinite and assume that that causes it to to trend

1104
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:17,440
to zero in a long term um you know like one one down every day is it's it's it's a very very

1105
02:55:17,440 --> 02:55:23,680
kind of slow trickle of new supply uh it takes about 27 years to to get to the market cap of um

1106
02:55:23,680 --> 02:55:29,840
or sorry to to get to the um the number of instances of nouns um that are like equivalent to the

1107
02:55:29,840 --> 02:55:35,840
the total supply of pawns or board apes etc uh and and you know if if you certainly like look at the

1108
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:42,400
the kind of like market cap quote unquote of of those collections um you know especially

1109
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:51,040
yeah one second if if you look at the sort of like market caps that that those collections can

1110
02:55:51,040 --> 02:55:59,200
can support and sort of compare it to um that they kind of current current market caping nouns um

1111
02:55:59,200 --> 02:56:05,600
you know I I think it's like it's pretty clear that um the rate of noun production probably

1112
02:56:05,600 --> 02:56:12,880
doesn't have that much um impact on the noun price um the price is probably much more a function

1113
02:56:12,880 --> 02:56:20,240
of demand than supply uh on royalties and this may be a very naive question but how can artists

1114
02:56:20,240 --> 02:56:26,640
who create one-on-one uh create one-on-ones keep their own work right I mean we create and sell one

1115
02:56:27,360 --> 02:56:32,480
um that's very different from an addition or collection yeah I mean I I agreed uh and you know

1116
02:56:32,480 --> 02:56:41,680
I think you know the the royalty stuff like um to me is it's still like the the correct answers

1117
02:56:41,680 --> 02:56:49,120
there are sort of like much less obvious than um then CC zero right where it's like you know

1118
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:56,400
that there's there's already um kind of good infrastructure uh and and um kind of good conventions

1119
02:56:56,400 --> 02:57:02,640
around kind of solving solving that problem um royalties I think it's probably gonna take a lot more

1120
02:57:02,640 --> 02:57:07,520
kind of experimentation before there's a sort of like consensus model or maybe there won't

1121
02:57:07,520 --> 02:57:12,960
ever be a consensus model like maybe every artist will kind of um do do things a little bit

1122
02:57:12,960 --> 02:57:19,360
differently um you know I I think it's maybe like to the extent that the thing that artists are

1123
02:57:19,360 --> 02:57:26,960
monetizing is is provenance right um I think it's it's probably less about um keeping you know

1124
02:57:26,960 --> 02:57:36,240
10% of every piece and more about um monetizing the provenance over the long term right so like

1125
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:41,520
as an example it doesn't really matter for those early ex-copies it's like you know there

1126
02:57:41,520 --> 02:57:45,920
there are royalties on them or not because the amount of money ex-copy would make from an

1127
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:52,080
open addition today or you know the amount he made a year ago or whatever you know it's like

1128
02:57:52,080 --> 02:57:58,240
orders of magnitude larger than than what the royalty would capture um so I think it really it's

1129
02:57:58,240 --> 02:58:06,480
about kind of um monetizing the provenance like over over your career I think yeah the really tricky

1130
02:58:06,480 --> 02:58:13,120
thing here that is I guess not yet solved with which might be interesting to think about trying to

1131
02:58:13,120 --> 02:58:21,840
solve um at you know outside of implementing royalties is like if if you create a bunch of work

1132
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:29,520
early on um and then kind of stop creating work and then that early work becomes very very valuable

1133
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:33,200
how do you monetize that you know that that's the very specific case where the royalty makes a lot

1134
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:39,040
of sense um but my best guess is that there are like other more kind of like crypto native ways

1135
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:45,280
to solve that problem um that kind of don't come with them some of the baggage that that royalties

1136
02:58:45,280 --> 02:58:52,720
comes with um I don't know if the question is coherent but uh do you see dows expand in the future

1137
02:58:52,720 --> 02:58:57,760
as a possible framework to manage manage businesses in general what is this prevent what is preventing

1138
02:58:57,760 --> 02:59:08,320
this possibility today um yeah I mean it's an interesting question um you know I I think probably

1139
02:59:08,320 --> 02:59:13,680
just like crypto itself um there are some low hanging fruit like you know that there are some

1140
02:59:13,680 --> 02:59:22,880
kind of obvious use cases um where dows make a lot of sense um and and like where the advantages

1141
02:59:22,880 --> 02:59:29,680
of dows versus kind of like traditional corporations um give them a lot of a lot of leverage

1142
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:35,520
and like those are the natural um natural sort of spaces that they're going to occupy for a while

1143
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:42,160
and you know I maybe that that's just like Bitcoin and ether and and these sorts of assets as well

1144
02:59:42,160 --> 02:59:46,320
right which is like they have these like very very obvious early use cases but in the long run we

1145
02:59:46,320 --> 02:59:53,920
all expect that they will eventually kind of consume everything um and you know I I think the um

1146
02:59:54,960 --> 03:00:03,440
you know the the like dap dap as as like a concept is kind of like blockchain as a concept right

1147
03:00:03,440 --> 03:00:12,640
like um it it's sort it's a set of ideas um and and like um a sort of a set set of like abstract

1148
03:00:12,640 --> 03:00:19,200
rules about how something can work without necessarily being a specific implementation of those

1149
03:00:19,200 --> 03:00:25,520
things right like so it seems unlikely to me that you know like um I don't know like the

1150
03:00:25,520 --> 03:00:30,320
nouns framework is is the best way to manage a business in general because it's just very

1151
03:00:30,320 --> 03:00:35,600
impractical to manage like a business or a startup in a permissionless way where where you're like

1152
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:41,120
inviting someone you into into the business every day and and you know you you can't say whether

1153
03:00:41,120 --> 03:00:47,440
they should be in or out like obviously that that's not not the correct uh kind of framework

1154
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:53,200
for for running a startup um but you know that that all of the sort of tools are there to to do this

1155
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:58,320
in a very efficient way and and people will probably eventually figure out how to engineer them in

1156
03:00:58,320 --> 03:01:03,360
such a way that you know when when presented with the question of like should I should I start a

1157
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:08,400
uh sort of like on-chain organization you know or or should I go and kind of like set up a Delaware

1158
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:15,600
uh C-Corp like the answer will always be yes let's do it on-chain you know whether the sort of like

1159
03:01:15,600 --> 03:01:22,480
decentralized autonomous part of that is is is intact um I'm not sure but certainly on-chain

1160
03:01:22,480 --> 03:01:30,480
organizations will um will kind of eat eat everything in the long long term I would expect um yeah

1161
03:01:30,480 --> 03:01:34,000
that so that that's the end of the questions there I I'm not sure if anyone is is out there

1162
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:54,960
and still listening um but just let me know if you have more questions or you want to wrap it up

1163
03:01:54,960 --> 03:02:02,080
okay six five two nine says I think you're good let's wrap it here all right um okay look thanks

1164
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:07,840
a lot for uh for the questions everyone and uh hope hope you have a great day uh thank thank you

1165
03:02:07,840 --> 03:02:37,680
uh 6529 this has been a lot of fun cheers

1166
03:04:08,320 --> 03:04:33,040
