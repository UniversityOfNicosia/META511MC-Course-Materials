30:00.000 --> 30:02.000


30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
I'm very excited about today's discussion we have with us today the very famous 4156 and has been

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
famous in a variety of different contexts he wasÂ an incredible collector he is now a builder

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000


32:00.000 --> 32:02.000


32:30.000 --> 32:32.000

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000


37:00.000 --> 37:02.000


37:30.000 --> 37:32.000

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000


42:00.000 --> 42:02.000


42:30.000 --> 42:32.000


43:00.000 --> 43:02.000


43:30.000 --> 43:32.000

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000


49:00.000 --> 49:02.000


49:30.000 --> 49:32.000


50:00.000 --> 50:02.000


50:30.000 --> 50:32.000

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000


00:00.000 --> 00:02.000


00:30.000 --> 00:32.000


01:00.000 --> 01:02.000


01:30.000 --> 01:32.000


02:00.000 --> 02:02.000


02:30.000 --> 02:32.000


03:00.000 --> 03:02.000


03:30.000 --> 03:32.000


04:00.000 --> 04:02.000


04:30.000 --> 04:32.000


05:00.000 --> 05:02.000


05:02.000 --> 05:10.720
six and has been famous in a variety of different contexts. He was an incredible collector. He is

05:10.720 --> 05:18.240
now a builder and we're going to talk a little bit both about his journey from one area to the next

05:18.240 --> 05:26.480
area. But then the part that I think we're really going to begin to, 4156 is a deep thinker about how

05:26.480 --> 05:33.760
NFTs are going to work over the long run and that's some very distinctive and strong views about

05:33.760 --> 05:40.720
what is going to make for successful NFT collections. So we're going to begin to those and

05:40.720 --> 05:47.440
hit upon I think some real structural issues and he's using those structural issues. So first I'd

05:47.440 --> 05:52.320
love to welcome him to the course. I very much appreciate the time he's taking with us today.

05:52.320 --> 05:59.760
And before we get into any of these complicated issues, I'd love it if you could just share with

05:59.760 --> 06:08.800
us a little bit your background and pathway in crypto and NFTs and how did we end up where we are

06:08.800 --> 06:15.280
today in your life? What was that journey? What was that pathway? Take us from the beginning to

06:15.280 --> 06:18.480
the present day and then we'll get into more of the concept structures.

06:18.480 --> 06:27.760
Yeah, sure, absolutely and thanks a lot for having me. It was a really fun and interesting initiative

06:27.760 --> 06:35.280
and really happy to participate. So I've been in the crypto space since about 2013

06:36.560 --> 06:44.480
around that time. I was working at like a Y-combinator startup. I had kind of previous to that had

06:44.480 --> 06:51.840
this kind of very mixed background where I was doing kind of more creative work and realized it

06:51.840 --> 06:56.720
wasn't super efficient back then at paying the bills and thought that maybe learning about financial

06:56.720 --> 07:05.440
markets would be kind of a valuable way to do that. And then I ended up I guess have a tendency to

07:05.440 --> 07:10.480
become kind of obsessed with things. So I became very obsessed with traditional financial markets

07:10.480 --> 07:18.480
in addition to the kind of creative pursuits that I was undertaking and spent a lot of time

07:18.480 --> 07:23.760
learning to invest successfully. So at the time when I was working in a sort of creative

07:23.760 --> 07:35.600
capacity at this startup, I learned about Bitcoin. I think I read the white paper somewhere around.

07:35.600 --> 07:49.680
I think it was like the end of 2013 I believe. And I think I had to read through it a few times

07:49.680 --> 07:59.440
but when it clicked, I think that it was in this sort of like meeting place in my kind of creative

07:59.440 --> 08:05.920
and finance brain. And I just became completely obsessed with it, recognized immediately. It's

08:05.920 --> 08:12.000
sort of potential to change the world ended up buying a bunch of Bitcoins. And then when this

08:13.760 --> 08:23.600
first Bitcoin bubble happened very shortly after that, I decided I was just going to leave my

08:23.600 --> 08:30.720
job by job and just kind of use the bit of capital that I had to to start building things on

08:30.720 --> 08:39.200
on Bitcoin and block chains. And that was sort of like the genesis of my journey.

08:40.240 --> 08:45.840
So I've been in the space since then kind of working in various capacities on different kinds

08:45.840 --> 08:51.600
of projects. Some bootstraps, some venture funded, some were successful, some weren't.

08:51.600 --> 09:04.320
And after I guess a period of kind of relative quiet, I was kind of rediscovering some sort of

09:04.320 --> 09:14.160
creative pursuits and kind of started thinking about NFTs a little bit more. And kind of fell

09:14.160 --> 09:20.720
down that rabbit hole. I would say that it was probably my sort of third kind of crypto rabbit hole

09:20.720 --> 09:27.760
after becoming obsessed with Bitcoin and Ethereum. And again, it really sort of spoke to the creative

09:27.760 --> 09:38.240
parts of my brain and kind of discovered crypto punks and very quickly sort of acquired a lot

09:38.240 --> 09:44.320
of conviction that these were going to be important. And that we had always sort of thought

09:44.320 --> 09:52.720
in the crypto space that the things that would make it go mainstream were sort of these like

09:52.720 --> 09:59.200
financial applications like payments and very quickly after kind of discovering NFTs.

10:00.320 --> 10:06.400
I think I started to understand that the application layer might be cultural rather than financial.

10:06.400 --> 10:16.000
And yeah, as I sort of developed more conviction around that idea and ended up purchasing

10:16.000 --> 10:23.920
punk for 156. So kind of very quickly acquired this conviction that NFTs were going to be

10:23.920 --> 10:31.920
important and decided to take the leap and buy a crypto pumpkin. And my original thesis was

10:31.920 --> 10:37.120
that it would be a really cool idea to buy a punk and kind of like build a brand around it.

10:37.920 --> 10:47.120
My original kind of plan or intent was that for 156 was going to be a sort of artist

10:47.120 --> 10:53.600
of its own within the NFTs space. And you know, this was kind of preliminary maybe a bit kind

10:53.600 --> 10:59.600
of naive thinking. But now I was thinking that you know, the punk would like mint its own NFTs

10:59.600 --> 11:05.120
about bananas and you know, just kind of do silly sort of like absurdist art around this idea.

11:05.120 --> 11:09.760
And then kind of after getting deeper into this space kind of kind of had this realization

11:10.640 --> 11:16.720
that collecting other work from other artists who were kind of much more accomplished and up

11:16.720 --> 11:23.600
to some very interesting stuff might be a kind of more interesting pursuit. And you know,

11:23.600 --> 11:32.640
again, we can get into the kind of later realizations. I think that that ended up kind of leading

11:32.640 --> 11:38.720
me to sell the punk and start working on nouns. But I think those are kind of related to other

11:38.720 --> 11:44.880
questions. So yeah, the initial kind of run up into the space was again, and having this hybrid

11:44.880 --> 11:49.360
kind of creative and finance background and going through these kind of long periods of building

11:49.360 --> 11:55.120
and sort of obsession with different parts of the crypto technology stack with this more recent

11:55.120 --> 12:00.800
realization that NFTs were probably one of the most important developments so far in so far as

12:00.800 --> 12:06.160
as they sort of represent the application layer and the way an awful lot of people get onboarded

12:06.160 --> 12:14.400
into this tech. Okay, well, I think this is a great background and let's start with

12:14.400 --> 12:20.480
actually punk 4156 because I had mentioned this in my presentation a couple of days ago.

12:22.320 --> 12:29.040
The crypto punks, I don't think when they were launched were thought of as PFPs per se. I think

12:29.040 --> 12:37.200
there was somewhere between collectible art, fun, crypto-native thing. And I'm not saying that

12:37.200 --> 12:47.120
they were not used as PFPs by anyone before G-Money and you, but I've been in crypto since

12:47.120 --> 12:51.280
2013. I think I read the white paper three or four months before you, so I think we're in the

12:51.280 --> 13:02.480
same crypto class. And it was very, very clear to me when this idea of a punk as a PFP entered

13:02.480 --> 13:10.560
my radar screen and it was first with G-Money, I think it was in January 2021 and you in February

13:10.560 --> 13:20.160
of 2021. That's if I'm not mistaken. And let's take it a little bit to this concept of a PFP

13:20.160 --> 13:27.280
as an identity, how it's, how you thought of it, why you thought this would be a good idea.

13:27.280 --> 13:34.560
Where are you mentally now about the idea of a PFP as an identity? Is it something people

13:34.560 --> 13:38.000
are going to do? Is it something people are going to stick with one? Are they going to use

13:38.000 --> 13:48.880
different ones? How does that fly out to you? Yeah, it's an interesting question. I had originally

13:48.880 --> 13:53.760
also claimed some crypto punks on the day they were launched, just claimed a handful of them

13:53.760 --> 13:59.040
because, again, early in the history of the space, there just wasn't that much to do and it was

13:59.040 --> 14:03.600
kind of seemed interesting. And I claimed a bunch of them and never really thought about them.

14:04.880 --> 14:12.960
I think for me, it was also developing the thesis that you could build an identity around this

14:13.600 --> 14:18.080
came much later than the realization that it was something you could own or that it might be

14:18.080 --> 14:26.320
interesting to own. And if I think back to the time when they were launched, I do think

14:26.320 --> 14:32.960
kind of initially there were a handful of people that were using them as their PFPs,

14:32.960 --> 14:36.960
or certainly there was another project, and I can't even remember if this was like a blockchain

14:36.960 --> 14:42.480
project or not, but there was a project called 8bit.me, I think around that time where people were

14:42.480 --> 14:53.920
using the characters as their PFPs. So I think this idea was sort of in the air.

14:55.520 --> 15:01.040
I think at a certain point kind of experimenting with Erbit, I had this idea that you could

15:01.040 --> 15:07.760
take the Erbit ID and build a Twitter account around the Erbit ID. So I think all these ideas

15:07.760 --> 15:15.360
were sort of in the air and it just took a handful of us to actually start doing it and

15:16.800 --> 15:22.640
doing it with conviction for it to become very, very popular. As with any sort of important

15:22.640 --> 15:28.960
trend, in the absence of the people that did it, other people would have done it and it would

15:28.960 --> 15:37.920
have happened anyway. So there is something sort of inherent in the medium or inherent in the nature of

15:39.040 --> 15:47.120
what kind of NFTs are and PFPs are that makes all of this make sense. And I don't know exactly

15:47.120 --> 15:54.960
what it is, but it certainly seems to feel right. Certainly to the extent that people don't just

15:54.960 --> 15:59.440
want to be themselves online, they want to be a character and to the extent that it's kind of

15:59.440 --> 16:12.960
interesting and fun that being a character in the context of a community of fixed size where

16:12.960 --> 16:18.320
other people also want to be similar characters, but not exactly the same character. That's a lot

16:18.320 --> 16:26.000
of fun. And then also this idea that what NFTs are, maybe they're this thing that is sort of

16:26.000 --> 16:32.400
able to soak up or capture all sorts of cultural value that other financial assets can't,

16:32.400 --> 16:39.440
and that all of the things that you do online could sort of accrue value to this sort of cultural

16:39.440 --> 16:45.760
value sink. All of these things kind of mixed up together and make it just very interesting and fun.

16:45.760 --> 16:54.400
And kind of intuitive to use these things as PFPs. I don't think it's just like a short-term trend,

16:54.400 --> 17:01.440
I do think it's here to stay. And I don't think there's as with most kind of sustainable trends,

17:01.440 --> 17:04.880
there's not just one reason for doing it. There's kind of lots of reasons for doing it that are all

17:04.880 --> 17:13.440
mixed up together. Okay, so then in a few months after that, I think there are a couple of episodes

17:13.440 --> 17:19.680
that stick in my mind where I think you're very vocal about a certain point of view.

17:20.640 --> 17:26.080
And in both cases, but certainly the first case, you weren't completely alone, but you were

17:26.080 --> 17:32.160
more on the alone side than not on the alone side. I think the first case was when the crypto

17:32.160 --> 17:39.200
folks came out and for those in order to know this, this was someone who did a project and took

17:39.200 --> 17:44.640
all the crypto punks and flipped them. I think it was the exact same. Punks and they flipped them

17:44.640 --> 17:53.120
facing the other way. And at least among some punk holders, this caused an uproar. They felt

17:53.120 --> 18:00.880
it would somehow hurt their punk. And I think a lot of pressure went on Larva Labs to do something

18:00.880 --> 18:07.280
about it, to file a DMCA or somehow take action against the folks. And I remember because I

18:07.280 --> 18:14.000
think this was very obvious to me. You were very much against Larva Labs doing anything.

18:14.560 --> 18:19.040
And you were saying like, this is silly why are you doing it? It's the token bit matters.

18:19.040 --> 18:25.680
This is very silly. Tell us a little bit about that because you were I think outside of the

18:25.680 --> 18:28.400
punk's consensus and even Larva Labs' consensus then.

18:31.440 --> 18:35.040
Yeah, sure. And I think there were a few reasons for that as well.

18:35.040 --> 18:44.640
You know, I think as someone who had been on the internet for a long time and sort of really

18:44.640 --> 18:55.120
understood the way memes and kind of culture flow on the internet, it just seemed logical to me

18:55.120 --> 19:06.400
that it would be a bad idea to kind of censor people who are kind of engaging in remix culture

19:06.400 --> 19:15.440
with a brand. Like that sort of fan culture, that sort of remix culture I think historically has

19:15.440 --> 19:22.160
supported the proliferation of things and supported the growth of things that would otherwise

19:22.160 --> 19:28.480
be obscure. So it just it seemed very counterintuitive to me that that you would want to censor it.

19:29.360 --> 19:35.040
It was also the case and we can get more into this if you want, but it was also the case that

19:35.040 --> 19:45.360
I was never really sure if if crypto punks were sort of like I always thought that they were

19:45.360 --> 19:50.880
a work of genius. I was never really sure if they were kind of like an intentional or accidental

19:50.880 --> 20:02.480
work of genius. And I sort of took the the the act of censorship as like a little bit of evidence.

20:02.480 --> 20:09.520
I think at that time that it might have been a bit more accidental. Again, and you know that's

20:09.520 --> 20:14.480
not at all to sort of like discredit the invention and discredit larval labs and what they created.

20:14.480 --> 20:22.480
But more to say that maybe they didn't necessarily fully comprehend that thing that they had

20:22.480 --> 20:28.880
created in the way that some people who are a bit more crypto native might have. And I sort of

20:28.880 --> 20:33.680
took this to be like a little bit of evidence that that maybe you know as as like a company or a

20:33.680 --> 20:41.040
group. They they weren't quite as as kind of like aligned with the crypto ethos as I thought they

20:41.040 --> 20:46.720
were. And and so you know I think I started speaking out out of a combination of like

20:49.120 --> 20:54.640
trying to advocate for the thing that would would create the maximum amount of value for punks.

20:54.640 --> 20:59.760
And then also out of concern that that you know that the stewards of this brand might be a little

20:59.760 --> 21:06.720
bit out of touch with the ethos of the space. And so I think that's a great follow on to what

21:06.720 --> 21:13.840
happened next. It's I think you were pushing for larval labs to have more permissive licensing

21:13.840 --> 21:20.800
back than their approach on licensing was at best unclear. And I think most people thought

21:21.840 --> 21:30.320
maybe you could use it up to a hundred thousand dollars per year of of earnings and the

21:30.320 --> 21:37.360
rebits license seem to emphasize something similar. So it was quite restrictive by what is now

21:37.360 --> 21:44.560
the current standards. And you were pushing for this model. There wasn't much of a response.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.840
And then you're very famously sold for one five six which I think was shocking to people.

21:50.880 --> 21:57.760
What was the logic there? Yeah sure so yeah you know I think all of this was kind of against

21:57.760 --> 22:05.920
a backdrop of just kind of developing a thesis over time. You know and I think it had started

22:05.920 --> 22:13.600
kind of significantly before that. It actually I think it started like a day or two after I bought

22:14.160 --> 22:18.320
for one five six. Because when I bought for one five six I never really thought about sort of like

22:18.320 --> 22:22.720
the copyright implications of trying to use for one five six as like a personality or an artist

22:22.720 --> 22:29.600
or a character. And a couple days later I thought I wonder what is the license on this thing

22:29.600 --> 22:35.600
that I bought. And so I started googling it and Google returned this article that I think had been

22:36.560 --> 22:43.760
co-created by Larva Labs and some a prominent law firm. I assumed it was their law firm at the time

22:43.760 --> 22:49.600
that talked about you know it was a blog post that that detailed like the order of operations to

22:49.600 --> 22:57.040
create a license that could be transferable within NFT. So I read this and you know with

22:57.040 --> 23:02.800
the understanding that it came from Larva Labs own firm believed that oh you know they must have

23:02.800 --> 23:11.040
a pretty liberal stance towards copyright if they're kind of co-publishing this sort of thought

23:11.040 --> 23:16.560
leadership with their lawyers. So I guess it's probably fine to do my own thing. And so I started

23:16.560 --> 23:22.400
doing my own thing and I had kind of DM the founders on a couple of occasions just to confirm that

23:22.400 --> 23:28.240
their stance was sort of as liberal as that blog post kind of made it seem and they just never

23:28.240 --> 23:38.240
responded. And so like kind of as time went on and you know they were doing things like DMCA

23:38.240 --> 23:46.000
and Fox. I started to worry a lot about well you know I mean worry about my specific kind of situation

23:46.000 --> 23:51.200
where I was I was starting to like build a brand around this thing and maybe I didn't own this

23:51.200 --> 23:57.840
thing. But then you know more generally again kind of worry about did they actually understand

23:58.400 --> 24:02.560
what was happening in the community because if like the whole thing that the community was doing

24:02.560 --> 24:10.160
was sort of like engaging in you know using these characters as their PFPs and you know kind of

24:11.200 --> 24:16.560
experimenting with building brands and personalities around them and again using the sort of NFT as

24:16.560 --> 24:22.640
as the sort of like sinking mechanism that like absorbs all of the activity that that that

24:22.640 --> 24:30.320
people are doing like nobody wants to do that that nobody wants to do that with something that

24:30.320 --> 24:35.600
they don't own in the in the long run right like nobody wants to kind of invest all this time

24:36.480 --> 24:42.080
in a situation where they could easily sort of be rugged by by the creators at some point in

24:42.080 --> 24:47.120
the future. And so you know I started to worry about it both in terms of my own situation

24:47.120 --> 24:51.440
but then also in terms of like is this thing as valuable as everybody thinks it is if if people

24:51.440 --> 24:58.320
can't actually do the thing with it that that they want to be doing. Now you know with in hindsight

24:58.320 --> 25:04.960
it seems a bit less obvious because I think after this conversation took place the narrative

25:04.960 --> 25:10.560
sort of shifted you know as it has happened in crypto on other occasions with Bitcoin going from

25:10.560 --> 25:16.560
you know being a payments mechanism to digital gold I think you know punks went from things that

25:16.560 --> 25:22.960
like people were using to represent their identity on some level to like you know the narrative

25:22.960 --> 25:26.800
the community changed the narrative to then kind of identify them as these historical artifacts

25:26.800 --> 25:30.800
right where where like you know the token was the only thing that mattered and copy right

25:30.800 --> 25:36.400
wouldn't matter but you know I started to disagreed with that stance and and you know I just

25:36.400 --> 25:40.880
thought it just does not make sense to continue to build a brand around something that I probably

25:40.880 --> 25:46.160
don't own and you know this thing is very valuable and I can use the capital for other things so

25:46.160 --> 25:51.920
you know I made I think at the time what felt like a very hard decision but I think ultimately

25:51.920 --> 25:57.600
the correct decision to to sell sell the punk and focus on other things.

25:59.840 --> 26:06.160
So after a few months after you did that and was hey for sure a bigger shock to everyone

26:06.720 --> 26:12.800
larvalabs then sold the IP to you that which then proceeded to put in a much more

26:12.800 --> 26:22.320
permissive license um a commercial license and this caused I think it's fair to say all types

26:22.320 --> 26:30.800
of mixed feelings among the punks holders and might take on it which I don't know it might be

26:30.800 --> 26:36.720
right it might be wrong I don't know my take on it was objectively the license is better it's

26:36.720 --> 26:44.400
more permissive it's more creative than it was before but what's clear but somehow the act of seeing

26:44.400 --> 26:55.120
the light the IP being sold maybe shattered some views illusions I don't know the people had

26:55.120 --> 27:03.840
previously about how larvalabs viewed the punks and even though objectively

27:03.840 --> 27:10.880
the punk owners had a better deal than they did ten minutes earlier a lot of them felt worse

27:10.880 --> 27:16.560
about how how do you say when you are someone on the outside now but what are your views on this?

27:18.240 --> 27:25.600
Yeah I mean I I think that when that happened it's sort of confirmed a lot of my fears so I

27:25.600 --> 27:32.640
mean I think the reason that there are sort of like there was a bad feeling around that is that

27:32.640 --> 27:40.080
again this sort of these brands are built by communities right like the the punks the punks

27:40.080 --> 27:44.560
IP is valuable because the community made it that way because people like g-money and me and

27:44.560 --> 27:49.280
you know lots of others kind of spent a lot of time kind of like turning our punks into characters

27:49.280 --> 27:58.320
and kind of proliferating awareness about them and then you know to see that kind of monetized

27:58.320 --> 28:03.040
by the creators without any real sort of meaningful value flowing back to the community

28:03.040 --> 28:09.680
I think that it sort of points out the kind of misalignment of incentives that was taking place

28:09.680 --> 28:16.160
there I also think and again you know I tend to be kind of like a lot more purist and kind of

28:16.160 --> 28:20.480
extreme in my views than a lot of people so you know to take this for what it's worth but like I

28:20.480 --> 28:26.720
don't think that a commercial license necessarily solves the problem yeah I don't think that

28:26.720 --> 28:32.880
I don't think the commercial license necessarily solves the problem because because I think it's

28:32.880 --> 28:40.880
the case that like no matter how permissive that license is it's the fact that it's revocable

28:40.880 --> 28:49.440
that that will cause people to not make that kind of you know deep and fundamental investment

28:49.440 --> 28:58.480
into you know building up the character or or building up the brand like I think no real serious

28:58.480 --> 29:04.080
entrepreneur is going to ever consider putting in you know five years ten years whatever it takes

29:04.080 --> 29:10.560
to like really build something meaningful when it's always the case that you know someone can pull

29:10.560 --> 29:14.800
the rug and say hey you know by the way that thing you built you know that the IP has been transferred

29:14.800 --> 29:19.920
to yet another another corporation and they don't want these things to have commercial licenses or

29:19.920 --> 29:26.880
we don't like the sort of sort of business that you're building so I think the the thing that

29:26.880 --> 29:36.320
the punk sort of received was kind of much lower in value than the thing that they saw kind of

29:36.320 --> 29:44.480
larval labs receiving based off of you know the community's hard work and that you know that that's

29:44.480 --> 29:49.840
sort of the reason that it didn't feel as good as as one might think it would intuitively

29:52.000 --> 29:59.520
yep okay that I think that parts clear and before we go to nouns which is I think the logical next

29:59.520 --> 30:03.760
step I want to take a sidetrack on something else because if we don't do it now I think I'm

30:03.760 --> 30:11.840
going to forget you want also if you asked me a year and a half ago what thoughts come to mind

30:11.840 --> 30:23.600
about you one was the pump 4156 but the other thing was that you're a very vocal ex-copy collector

30:23.600 --> 30:29.840
and just wanted to take it's kind of a side path here but take two or three minutes to share your

30:29.840 --> 30:35.600
thoughts about ex-copy you own some amazing ex-copies you own a lot of ex-copies you're a very

30:35.600 --> 30:47.600
vocal about it ex-copy also now has cc zero his work so where's the 4152 now and ex-copy yeah sure

30:47.600 --> 30:55.520
and you know I think again this this is like sort of interesting and and maybe evidence that all

30:55.520 --> 31:02.160
of this stuff is kind of mixed up together and you really have to kind of tease out the the

31:02.160 --> 31:10.240
different parts of it but like at the time I sold the punks and kept the ex-copy both punks and

31:10.240 --> 31:19.280
ex-copy were you know we're not we're not cc zero and you know my my thesis around selling the

31:19.280 --> 31:24.880
punk and keeping the ex-copy was that ex-copy was kind of more quote unquote crypto native than

31:24.880 --> 31:31.360
than larval labs and that it would probably be the case that the work would eventually become cc zero

31:31.360 --> 31:38.240
I mean also it was the case that the the the the kind of the premise of ownership was not you

31:38.240 --> 31:43.200
know based around the sort of like avatar pfp movement and people sort of like creating things

31:43.200 --> 31:48.400
around their their personas and so it seemed like you know the the commercial rights kind of

31:48.400 --> 31:57.280
mattered less for for ex-copy and and so yeah you know I I think I feel sort of validated there

31:57.280 --> 32:03.120
in the sense that you know after the sale Larva transferred the IP to Yuga and an ex-copy kind of

32:03.120 --> 32:09.440
cc zeroed all of their work so that that felt good but you know in terms of just like the the

32:09.440 --> 32:16.320
the kind of like pure value of of the ex-copy ownership you know I think in in in most fields

32:16.320 --> 32:21.680
and and I think especially early on in most fields you know you you have these these kind of like

32:21.680 --> 32:28.640
outlier performers and and it's my view that that ex-copy is is one of these kind of outliers in

32:28.640 --> 32:35.600
the context of crypto art I I think there's like a very sort of large gap between ex-copy and second

32:35.600 --> 32:42.240
place whoever that might be I don't have an opinion but you know I I think certainly like if if

32:42.240 --> 32:48.320
there's there's anyone to have like a thesis around with with respect to crypto art I think it's

32:48.320 --> 32:54.160
ex-copy I think the work I mean aesthetically it's incredible he's he's clearly you know they're

32:54.160 --> 33:01.440
clearly a master of their craft the the work itself I think is very interesting in the sense that

33:01.440 --> 33:07.200
it sort of like talks about crypto history and it kind of like references crypto history in a way

33:07.200 --> 33:14.800
that kind of like proves and proves ex-copy's crypto nativeness and and I think it's also the

33:14.800 --> 33:22.800
case that these these NFT timestamps sort of matter and and again this is a whole other kind

33:22.800 --> 33:28.720
of field or a whole other subject to get into but you know like if if if the things that sort of

33:28.720 --> 33:35.360
matter with with respect to like crypto art are kind of like timestamps and and aesthetic and

33:35.360 --> 33:43.200
provenance like ex-copy has all three kind of in in a way that that no other other artist does

33:43.200 --> 33:48.720
right like the the work is stunning the work is very very early and the work is kind of like about

33:48.720 --> 33:55.280
the movement and and kind of native to the movement in a way that almost nothing else is so I

33:55.280 --> 33:59.360
I just think it's like it's a very very obvious like if you if you have a thesis with respect to

33:59.360 --> 34:06.320
crypto art ex-copy is like the purest and highest quality way to kind of express that thesis and

34:06.320 --> 34:12.160
you know they're they're just super cool to to own and and yeah I just everything about it is

34:12.160 --> 34:18.560
just very very interesting in my opinion okay so I mean you're not going to get any objection to

34:18.560 --> 34:24.400
me about from about from me about ex-copy I agree completely with everything you said two

34:24.400 --> 34:30.560
interesting points that one of these out from there and one I think it's clear given your thesis

34:30.560 --> 34:40.480
on why owning the IP is important the pfp's really do gain value from the activity of the community

34:41.120 --> 34:47.200
whereas an ex-copy less so now it's still probably better I think in view of you but it words

34:47.200 --> 34:51.760
you're not that it is cc zero because of the derivatives will get more attention on what have

34:51.760 --> 34:59.600
you but it is less if you own a certain ex-copy you and your personal activities are likely to

34:59.600 --> 35:08.560
add less value to it than if you own a certain pfp is that a fair assessment yeah I think so like if

35:10.240 --> 35:16.240
like the and I actually I don't know for sure like it could be possible that all of this is

35:16.240 --> 35:20.800
the same thing and you know we're just talking about like very small nuances but like you know

35:20.800 --> 35:28.400
intuitively it feels like if if I set my pfp to the Mona Lisa my my activities are going to have

35:28.400 --> 35:33.600
very little impact on the Mona Lisa you I suppose you could argue to the extent that there's

35:33.600 --> 35:38.160
there's only a small handful of people in the world that know ex-copy that you know if if I set my

35:38.160 --> 35:43.760
my pfp to like this is clearly money laundering or right click save guy and you know what was like

35:43.760 --> 35:51.520
a famous character that that was kind of like you know identifying as that thing but that that

35:51.520 --> 35:59.120
actually it it could kind of operate the same way as it does in the in the pfp universe but

36:00.240 --> 36:06.240
I think maybe the distinction is that like in in the pfp universe like

36:07.840 --> 36:12.080
it doesn't really feel like anybody is sort of like competing around the same piece right like

36:12.080 --> 36:15.840
there's the reason that there's 10,000 crypto punks and there's only one right click save guy

36:15.840 --> 36:20.720
well actually not the reason that that that's true but but the the the consequence of that

36:21.360 --> 36:26.400
is that like a community of 10,000 people can form and like each one can

36:26.400 --> 36:33.120
can each individual in the community can kind of like inhabit one of the 10,000 but you know there's

36:33.120 --> 36:37.760
only one right click save guy and so and so there's like maybe an unnatural amount of competition

36:37.760 --> 36:43.280
that would emerge if everybody wanted to kind of inhabit that that identity so I don't know

36:43.280 --> 36:49.040
there there's some sort of like cultural difference I guess even if mechanically all of these

36:49.040 --> 36:54.080
things work the same way that there's like a cultural difference around the pfp's versus the

36:54.080 --> 36:58.720
the sort of canonical works of crypto art and and how people want to use them

36:59.920 --> 37:04.480
that makes perfect sense and I want to go to the timestamp issue because this is one where

37:04.480 --> 37:13.360
I think your view is what's generally believed um what I think I believe early crypto timestamps

37:13.360 --> 37:19.680
are important but let me make the opposite case for a second if I think about major art movements

37:21.120 --> 37:27.440
any of them like literally any major art will last a few hundred years nobody cares

37:27.440 --> 37:39.120
what specific date the first piece of fill in your favorite art movement right was made right I

37:39.120 --> 37:46.000
mean I don't even people maybe talk within decades they certainly I don't think talk within like days

37:46.000 --> 37:54.640
or months and the pieces that you remember the pieces that have become important often come later

37:54.640 --> 38:01.360
in an artist's career I'll take Picasso Picasso's most famous work was not as early as work

38:02.000 --> 38:07.200
as early as work is interesting historically what have you but if someone is going to pick the

38:07.200 --> 38:14.480
Picasso you could pick only one Picasso and you could put it in your museum you wouldn't go to

38:14.480 --> 38:20.640
young Picasso and take the first painting you made right how do we how do we reconcile this tour

38:20.640 --> 38:25.520
is it different with a blockchain yeah I mean I think it's different with a blockchain because

38:25.520 --> 38:32.640
because like those those artistic movements weren't kind of built on top of time stamping machines

38:32.640 --> 38:41.120
right like it it's it's it's related to the medium I think that the timestamps become more

38:41.120 --> 38:48.560
important in crypto art than in traditional art um yeah I think it's just kind of like a

38:48.560 --> 38:53.600
a fundamental property of the medium and again I'm not saying that like timestamp is the only thing

38:53.600 --> 38:59.200
that's important you know I I think there's there's probably a Venn diagram and and you know maybe

38:59.200 --> 39:05.280
maybe uh in in the context of crypto art like the timestamp circle is just like much larger than it is

39:05.280 --> 39:14.480
in in in then in traditional art um I think like one one way you can think about this that I

39:14.480 --> 39:19.040
I mean and again I don't know if this is right this is just kind of a crazy way that I think about

39:19.040 --> 39:27.840
it is like if you look at NFTs as as as as currencies right as social currencies and every artist

39:27.840 --> 39:33.200
is kind of creating their own currency you know there there is a sense in which this the kind of

39:33.200 --> 39:38.080
aggregate supply is unbounded right and and and the market will have to make decisions about

39:38.720 --> 39:44.160
um you know which which ones are valuable and which ones aren't and again like looking at the

39:44.160 --> 39:47.840
movement and looking at the culture you could you can reference something like Bitcoin which you

39:47.840 --> 39:54.080
know we all know is sort of like obsessed with this this 21 million coin limit um if if you look

39:54.080 --> 40:01.120
at NFTs I believe you know it's like only very recently um have there been kind of 21 million

40:01.120 --> 40:08.720
ERC721s created and and the number of of NFTs that are created is kind of increasing kind of

40:08.720 --> 40:13.120
exponentially with adoption and interest in the technology so you have this like very obvious kind

40:13.120 --> 40:20.560
of like um curve in in the in the NFT kind of money supply creation right that you know the

40:20.560 --> 40:26.640
the kind of hockey hockey stick shaped growth that you see in as most technologies are adopted

40:27.280 --> 40:33.120
and I think that curve makes makes like for a very interesting kind of thesis around collecting

40:33.120 --> 40:38.640
right that like in in the early history of this space um these that this currency was much more

40:38.640 --> 40:44.320
scarce and if if the timestamps matter uh like old timestamps are more scarce the new timestamps

40:45.040 --> 40:49.440
um and I just I don't think we have that sense when we think about uh think about paintings right

40:49.440 --> 40:54.000
we we don't think about like the exponential growth of like canvases over time and and that we could

40:54.000 --> 40:59.040
like track that with 100% certainty using some sort of technology but in in the context of NFTs

40:59.040 --> 41:03.920
we can do that now whether people will do that I don't know but you know at minimum it's a kind

41:03.920 --> 41:09.680
of interesting thesis to have or interesting kind of angled it to to use to think about the tech

41:12.320 --> 41:19.120
got it makes sense well I guess we will this one we just won't know until the future right we're

41:19.120 --> 41:24.880
going to have to like run the clock forward a few decades and then see see how it plays out it's

41:24.880 --> 41:30.640
compelling it's compelling but it is it will be different I think if it happens okay I agree

41:30.640 --> 41:35.920
great one one last point on that is like I mean someone could easily go and and kind of model it

41:35.920 --> 41:41.680
today right like you you there's um there's probably some sort of like multi-factorial analysis

41:41.680 --> 41:46.880
that you could use to kind of like cancel out the the sort of like the provenance and aesthetic

41:46.880 --> 41:52.640
premiums and and like just look purely at timestamp and just see if this sort of curve is intact

41:53.440 --> 41:59.200
and I mean I would argue that like they're inferior at least could be a lot of value in doing

41:59.200 --> 42:04.880
that because you could run some sort of statistical arbitrage on on timestamps you know if if if

42:04.880 --> 42:09.040
the pattern is emerging and then there are lots of kind of like outliers within the pattern

42:10.880 --> 42:16.880
interesting interesting well if someone's listening and is good at math and good at reading data

42:16.880 --> 42:25.680
from a watching there might be an interesting analysis to do there okay let's go now to nouns

42:25.680 --> 42:33.280
because I think given what has happened over the last 45 minutes we can kind of see the pathway

42:33.280 --> 42:40.960
to what nouns came from and let's start with describing your words you know what the nouns are

42:40.960 --> 42:47.440
what they're trying to accomplish or the design design decisions that you made and how that links

42:47.440 --> 42:56.560
to your thesis about what's going to work with NFTs in general or PFPs specifically yeah yeah sure

42:56.560 --> 43:02.320
happy to do that yeah so I mean you know the the kind of invention of nouns was in many ways a

43:02.320 --> 43:09.200
sort of reaction to you know all of the kind of like emergent issues that I saw with with crypto

43:09.200 --> 43:21.600
punks and you know if I remember correctly I sold for 156 after yeah kind of a while after I had

43:21.600 --> 43:27.040
already been kind of thinking about noun so you know it it wasn't necessarily that the reaction

43:27.040 --> 43:33.840
to this like came from disillusionment with punks it had been just starting to think about like

43:33.840 --> 43:40.160
you know what could could quote unquote punks 2.0 look like a while before that and and I thought

43:40.160 --> 43:46.400
you know I thought I had kind of written down some interesting features that that it might have

43:46.400 --> 43:53.520
so you know like like one of the issues that has has been kind of present all through crypto

43:53.520 --> 44:00.240
history it is is this sort of idea of fair distribution and and you know just the large extent to

44:00.240 --> 44:04.000
which kind of being in the right place at the right time has has kind of like influenced

44:05.200 --> 44:11.520
who ends up holding holding certain assets and and how how that group ends up kind of

44:13.360 --> 44:18.720
using that luck in some ways to kind of like secret on on future crypto participants so I

44:18.720 --> 44:23.200
thought well one one feature that you know this this next version of punks or you know however you

44:23.200 --> 44:28.000
want to think about it should have is that you know the distribution should happen very very slowly

44:28.000 --> 44:33.680
over time and I thought it might be really really interesting to start one of these collections with

44:33.680 --> 44:51.120
with zero kind of zero money supplies zero instances and then just have like a new one created

44:51.120 --> 45:01.040
every day forever the forever part you know if if you kind of like kind of increase the money

45:01.040 --> 45:09.680
money supply kind of slowly enough then it could just be kind of perpetually inflationary

45:10.400 --> 45:19.280
and and you know it any one over over any any kind of period of crypto history would would have

45:19.280 --> 45:25.600
in some sense like an equal opportunity to participate um so I thought that that's kind of where

45:26.320 --> 45:33.520
where one one one entity every day forever came from um then I started thinking about well like

45:34.560 --> 45:44.880
you know if if um this project is like if it if it is going to to be forever then maybe it should be

45:44.880 --> 45:56.880
um like what is the most extensive kind of what is the most extensible metaphor I can kind of come

45:56.880 --> 46:05.520
up with um to create something that that could have this kind of longevity um and that's what

46:05.520 --> 46:11.520
made me think about nouns um it's it's just so kind of not specific right you could you could

46:11.520 --> 46:19.760
you could kind of include anything in in a collection that you know it it doesn't identify itself as

46:19.760 --> 46:28.240
as punks or you know penguins like it you could just include anything at all and that might make

46:28.240 --> 46:38.560
it really fun um the next thing I thought about was was this sort of um the maybe a little bit of

46:38.560 --> 46:46.080
a lack of coordination um that existed within the punks community and then also the fact that like

46:46.080 --> 46:51.760
the whole reason that people had kind of got together to to kind of cheer these things on

46:52.320 --> 46:59.920
like that that it was mostly predicated on this idea that that the price was going up or the number

46:59.920 --> 47:07.280
was going up and you know what what might happen if um if that stopped what what would happen to

47:07.280 --> 47:13.040
kind of the culture if if the only thing to do in the community was kind of like cheer on the price

47:13.040 --> 47:20.800
bubble um so then I thought about well maybe um maybe this this sort of thing you should

47:20.800 --> 47:31.360
instantiate a doubt and then all all of the NFTs can can can act as this kind of governance tokens

47:31.360 --> 47:39.840
for controlling uh the organization uh and and then um I thought well that that actually works

47:39.840 --> 47:46.480
really well with this sort of like um perpetually inflationary money supply because in theory it

47:46.480 --> 47:55.280
would mean that um the the doubt could have this this perpetual source of funding um and and so

47:55.280 --> 48:03.520
I mean you know it I kind of wrote down all of these ideas um noodle them for a couple of weeks

48:03.520 --> 48:10.800
and then um had had this moment where I kind of composed them into a Twitter thread and just

48:10.800 --> 48:15.760
did this got check of like should I hit send or not is this something I want to build or not

48:15.760 --> 48:25.680
um and then I hit send on on you know you can look on my Twitter um and and see the I guess like

48:25.680 --> 48:30.960
the sort of de facto what like paper that I wrote down for nouns and at the end of it I said hey

48:30.960 --> 48:36.080
does anyone want to work on this um and I think it you know it was very fortunate that at that

48:36.080 --> 48:41.840
moment kind of in the history of the space um there were a lot of like really talented interesting

48:41.840 --> 48:47.280
people around that were looking for something cool to work on um and a bunch of them reached out

48:47.280 --> 48:53.520
and the rest was history over over the next few months we we built what nouns is today uh and we

48:53.520 --> 49:05.680
want we launched did on uh August 8 so in addition to one noun a day I think other interesting

49:05.680 --> 49:13.760
features of the nouns are that the money from the sales is not received by you are the team that

49:13.760 --> 49:19.600
goes into some type of treasury which we'll talk about you and the team are receiving aggregate one

49:19.600 --> 49:29.520
in every 10 nouns for a period of time the the nouns are all cc 0 in the public domain and there

49:29.520 --> 49:38.480
are no royalties right so this is quite a lot of different design decisions and in aggregate

49:39.440 --> 49:48.080
I think your logic on some of these but I'd love to hear it is that they will allow the nouns

49:48.080 --> 49:54.320
and the nouns culture or token or have you to spread further faster right is that the logic

49:54.320 --> 50:00.160
yeah that's that's right and yeah thanks for filling in those those details that I missed that

50:00.160 --> 50:06.400
that that's right um you know that I think one of the sort of central um part of my central

50:06.400 --> 50:11.760
pieces around cc 0 is is that kind of copies make originals more valuable right if like

50:12.560 --> 50:19.680
ultimately the thing that is valuable here is is the token is this kind of um thing that we

50:19.680 --> 50:25.680
can you know we can point to the blockchain and and we can prove that you know beyond a doubt this

50:25.680 --> 50:33.920
this is the original original instance of a noun um that that you you no longer need in that context

50:33.920 --> 50:42.720
to kind of um defend how an image is used or how an image is is proliferated um you know just

50:42.720 --> 50:47.040
just like we look at um something like the original Mona Lisa and it's famous because

50:47.040 --> 50:53.360
everybody knows what it is um it could be the case that you could have you know if you if you own

50:53.360 --> 50:59.040
one of the very few original nouns and everybody in the world knows what they are that that you know

50:59.040 --> 51:03.760
that might make them more valuable and so so the sort of like one of the objectives of these

51:03.760 --> 51:08.480
communities and I think you know there's lots of subtle reasons we can we can identify that they

51:08.480 --> 51:13.040
should have other objectives but one of the objectives of these communities is the sort of like

51:13.040 --> 51:19.520
cultural proliferation of the meme and and yeah a sort of set of initial conditions that let that

51:19.520 --> 51:24.240
proliferation happen as freely as possible you know that that subsidize that proliferation or

51:24.240 --> 51:30.080
or kind of set it on a trajectory to kind of happen as quickly as possible um that that might be

51:30.080 --> 51:34.640
something that kind of creates value will that creates value for for the community

51:34.640 --> 51:45.360
all right let's dig into some of these things let's say I don't own a noun right because the

51:45.360 --> 51:53.280
nouns holders how many nouns are there today uh let's see where are we today um today is uh

51:53.280 --> 52:00.000
484 I think there's some pretty big holders right so how many how many addresses hold an

52:00.000 --> 52:05.280
noun maybe a couple hundred something like that yeah I think a number of unique holders is about

52:05.280 --> 52:09.760
50% of the total supply I believe somewhere around there okay so let's say a couple of hundred

52:09.760 --> 52:19.360
so there's 8 million people in the world 200 out of noun for the 7.999 billion people who don't

52:19.360 --> 52:27.600
own a noun why should they go help the nouns become more valuable which is the thesis yeah sure

52:27.600 --> 52:33.760
so I mean I um I think there's a few different things to talk about here right um and and I

52:33.760 --> 52:40.960
think the the reason it's sort of like unintuitive to talk about these things is um partly because of

52:40.960 --> 52:47.600
the the kind of initial set of conventions that the NFT community has adopted um you know one

52:47.600 --> 52:54.800
one is one of those conventions is that like um NFT ownership is this kind of like one to one premise

52:54.800 --> 53:00.320
right like you have one individual and one owner right that um communities for example

53:00.960 --> 53:06.560
won't eventually own uh individual NFTs which which I think they will so I think you know it's

53:06.560 --> 53:11.920
kind of a false premise in the first place to to say that because there are only um you know

53:11.920 --> 53:17.680
400 nouns um there can only be 400 owners I think in the very long term you know it becomes

53:17.680 --> 53:23.440
actually much more interesting than you know 8 billion nouns if if you know thousands and thousands

53:23.440 --> 53:29.520
of people are are kind of um not forced but like um kind of encouraged by the protocol to to

53:29.520 --> 53:34.400
kind of coordinate their ownership of of a single noun and to operate that vote so I think that

53:34.400 --> 53:38.480
that's one way you can think about it you know the the other way you can think about it is that um

53:39.360 --> 53:46.160
like if you look at kind of traditional traditional brands um or or sort of like traditional

53:46.160 --> 53:53.040
media properties the kind of like the ownership of the IP and um the the sort of like fandom of the

53:53.040 --> 53:59.680
IP are rarely the same thing right like every every Mickey Mouse fan is not like an owner of

53:59.680 --> 54:06.480
Disney equity right um there's there's kind of a relationship between owning the Disney

54:06.480 --> 54:12.160
equity and uh being a Mickey Mouse fan which is like there's a sense in which owning the equity

54:12.160 --> 54:22.480
kind of like seeks rent on on on the fandom um but I I think um that can be very very fluid right

54:22.480 --> 54:27.920
it's it's it's possible that people can be fans of of nouns and and fans of kind of like what the

54:27.920 --> 54:35.120
protocol gets gets up to without owning uh owning a noun it's possible that they they can kind of

54:35.760 --> 54:41.760
unlike the case of Disney they can actually just use the IP and kind of monetize it for themselves

54:41.760 --> 54:46.560
right and in that sense the IP sort of like seeks less rent on the fandom because the fans can

54:46.560 --> 54:51.840
just make their own merch and and kind of make make their own stuff um I hope in the long run

54:51.840 --> 54:59.360
you know it um the the the sort of cost of ownership um for for kind of participating um in in

54:59.360 --> 55:05.120
in ownership uh drop significantly right such such that a fan that has five dollars could own like

55:05.120 --> 55:11.920
you know point zero zero zero one percent of of a noun and and you know consequently get to

55:11.920 --> 55:17.680
participate in in kind of governance decisions around around the protocol um so you know I I

55:17.680 --> 55:23.040
think there's sort of a lot of subtleties here that um will in the long run inform the relationship

55:23.760 --> 55:29.360
between ownership and fandom and that these things are not as as kind of like vanilla as as the

55:29.360 --> 55:36.720
NFT space has has led them uh has sort of led people to believe they are so if that's the case

55:36.720 --> 55:44.800
right if people get together and buy a noun collectively does it suggest that the nouns become

55:47.040 --> 55:54.000
more like general brands less your identity right because it seems hard to me let's say

55:54.000 --> 55:59.520
ten thousand people each shipped in five bucks and we bought now three thousand two hundred and

55:59.520 --> 56:07.840
seventy two I've very early on I tried to see what it was like on the fractalization side I think

56:07.840 --> 56:15.280
I bought sixty ape tokens one of the fungapes is fractalized and I'll be honest I didn't feel the

56:15.280 --> 56:25.280
same connection as when I owned a punk directly right like one one I felt like I own an identity uh I

56:25.280 --> 56:32.640
had the sense of ownership when I owned an ERC twenty token a fungible token that was

56:33.200 --> 56:39.440
x percent of a punk ape maybe it's an investment maybe it's about investment but I didn't I

56:39.440 --> 56:46.000
said I don't have these identity feelings right and so given how few nouns there are given that

56:46.000 --> 57:00.480
you're saying people should or might collectively control them does it mean that the nouns are

57:00.480 --> 57:12.080
less apfp identity type uh NFT and something all different how should we think about that yeah

57:12.080 --> 57:20.160
I mean it's a good question I you know I think again it kind of it the I think it's there's a

57:20.160 --> 57:28.720
sense in which the early history of the NFT space is probably responsible for you know the sub-optimal

57:28.720 --> 57:33.200
experience that you had with with the ape ownership I think there are sort of much more interesting

57:34.800 --> 57:39.040
design decisions that can be made around collective ownership you know if we just wanted to

57:39.040 --> 57:44.400
brainstorm a few with with respect to nouns like you you could look at the noun that that I have

57:44.400 --> 57:53.120
right now and you could imagine that that it is sort of the the pfp or the flag for a community

57:53.120 --> 57:59.520
um but that community members would have a certain freedom to kind of interpret how they relate

57:59.520 --> 58:03.920
to that flag right so maybe everyone in the community has the same glasses but a different head

58:03.920 --> 58:08.560
or we all have the same shirts or we all use the horse head and we dress it up differently um there

58:08.560 --> 58:15.040
there's a kind of um uh it kind of experimental protocol that's being built on top of nouns

58:15.040 --> 58:21.120
right now called composables um which which kind of proposes building a kind of market marketplace

58:21.120 --> 58:29.040
uh for for traits for nouns um so that you could you could kind of apply those traits to the pfp

58:29.040 --> 58:33.920
so I think there again there's there's all sorts of room for for nuance and and for builders to

58:33.920 --> 58:38.960
to create kind of interesting experiences around collective ownership uh and I think a lot of

58:38.960 --> 58:44.080
those don't exist today so I I do think ultimately it's just very interesting to think about a noun

58:44.080 --> 58:48.960
as representing a community rather than an individual with kind of lots of room for individual

58:48.960 --> 58:55.200
expression um you know uh within the context of that community or or kind of within the context

58:55.200 --> 59:00.160
of of the noun as as the flag for the community yeah this makes sense to me and I think that

59:00.160 --> 59:06.480
is what I was trying to get up and though given the structure of nouns specifically how few

59:06.480 --> 59:16.480
there are right just not that many nouns it is one so some people some noun or g's in the future

59:16.480 --> 59:22.480
they'll be noun or g's might actually own a whole noun right is that that's going to be a thing

59:22.480 --> 59:27.280
like oh I don't know a whole noun it's like you own a whole bitcoin like that type of logic and

59:28.320 --> 59:34.720
but many of them might be like a symbol for a guild or a community something like that is

59:34.720 --> 59:39.600
that a right good way to think about them yeah I think that's right and again I think there's

59:39.600 --> 59:45.600
there's very very little correlation between like um you know whole numbers in the money supply and

59:45.600 --> 59:54.800
uh like you know the cap of possible participants within within a community um you know this idea

59:54.800 --> 00:00.960
that these things are are kind of like directly correlated I do think it's like a product of

00:00.960 --> 00:07.200
of just how early it is you can you can certainly imagine and like it's hard to imagine

00:07.600 --> 00:14.640
um creating like okay so I would ask how do you how could you if you wanted to to create like

00:14.640 --> 00:20.880
one instance of an NFT for everyone in the world you know you you can't today create a kind of

00:20.880 --> 00:26.960
PFP collection you know that that like let's eight eight billion people buy in you know nobody wants

00:26.960 --> 00:31.600
to kind of participate in a community at the moment where where you know the the money supplies

00:31.600 --> 00:36.160
that inflated um so I think I think you just have to think about like how do you how would it be

00:36.160 --> 00:42.720
possible to scale any one of these communities um um to kind of maximize participation and also just

00:42.720 --> 00:49.520
have like a sort of seen money supply and I think like the only reasonable answer is that over time

00:50.400 --> 00:54.720
people will have to kind of figure out how to divide up the money supply such that more and more

00:54.720 --> 01:01.680
people can participate okay I think I think that's clear let's talk about royalties because that

01:01.680 --> 01:13.680
is a very hot topic today and the space is divided I think um some exchanges and said look we're

01:13.680 --> 01:19.520
not going to order or honor artists royalties or we'll make it optional which I think is more or

01:19.520 --> 01:28.320
less the same thing um some I think long time crypto people say like well yeah this is obvious

01:28.320 --> 01:34.480
of course this is how it's going to end up like anything else is naive some artists saying well

01:34.480 --> 01:42.480
this is kind of ridiculous like I part of what I signed up for when I minted this piece was

01:43.600 --> 01:50.240
I'm minting it a surprise and this is the expectation this was that the royalty was part of that

01:50.240 --> 01:57.120
price it was part of the deal and then I guess there's this third point of view that it's kind of

01:57.120 --> 02:00.880
wide and top technical but it'll be kind of weird to say like hey you can do whatever we want

02:00.880 --> 02:08.320
on Ethereum but the only thing we can't do is have a royalty right I think it seems conceptually

02:08.320 --> 02:13.120
weird for permission the system right and we must have the technical issues right it's not

02:13.120 --> 02:18.720
a technical question it's kind of a philosophical question where are you on this right where are

02:18.720 --> 02:23.840
you on this topic obviously nouns do not have royalties how do you feel about royalties in general

02:23.840 --> 02:29.520
is it different for pfp is it different for one art is it anyway are they anyway doomed should

02:29.520 --> 02:36.320
people think about organizing themselves not to expect royalties what's your view yeah sure so I

02:36.320 --> 02:42.640
mean obviously it's it's a very kind of controversial topic and and maybe rightly so because people

02:42.640 --> 02:47.120
have have this idea that you know they're kind of future earning power is is kind of like wrapped

02:47.120 --> 02:54.240
up in their ability to to collect royalties so I I respect you know that the conversation gets

02:54.240 --> 03:00.480
very heated when discussing it now I try to take like a maybe like a sort of first principles

03:00.480 --> 03:09.920
approach in thinking about it and the way I think about it is that like artists or kind of NFT

03:09.920 --> 03:17.280
creators if you if you if you start from the premise that that these are are kind of social tokens

03:17.280 --> 03:27.440
right artists and and kind of creators of NFTs mentors of NFTs already just have a tremendous kind

03:27.440 --> 03:35.280
of amount of of kind of power in the relationship between artist and collector or you know

03:35.280 --> 03:42.080
mentor and owner that never existed before and that power is that that you know they have the

03:42.080 --> 03:49.680
final say in it over the money supply now I mean you can you can kind of carve out things like

03:49.680 --> 03:54.240
nouns where where we try to kind of get around that problem by by making the the sort of money

03:54.240 --> 04:00.560
supply algorithmic but you know like most of I think the most interesting conversation about royalties

04:00.560 --> 04:06.000
is around kind of individual creators right and and their relationship with royalties and so I

04:06.000 --> 04:12.960
think I think what's kind of misunderstood with respect to this topic is is just like how much

04:12.960 --> 04:18.480
power artists have with respect to the money supply right they they they can create a new piece

04:19.040 --> 04:24.640
and inflate the money supply kind of arbitrarily at any time if the thing that is being kind of

04:24.640 --> 04:30.240
purchased by collectors is provenance it doesn't matter if you know the the the pieces in the same

04:30.240 --> 04:37.120
collection as the last collection you know that if it's the artist's first token or 70 a token like

04:37.120 --> 04:43.440
none of that matters the point is that it sort of every time that that kind of creator creates new

04:43.440 --> 04:49.360
work they're they're kind of inflating the money supply of of the social token and that and

04:49.360 --> 04:55.360
that gives them just a tremendous amount of kind of leverage and and frankly earning power right

04:55.360 --> 05:00.880
that in my view means that they shouldn't also need to sort of tax the transactions that that

05:00.880 --> 05:07.200
happen within their own economy and and I think ultimately that that's sort of what what royalties

05:07.200 --> 05:13.520
are in more practical terms I think I think royalties are are just kind of make for poor incentive

05:13.520 --> 05:21.360
alignment because what what they sort of incentivize for the artist is is more volatility because

05:21.360 --> 05:27.600
every time people want to buy and sell that that artist's work that artists collects a royalty

05:27.600 --> 05:34.000
so like you know in any one of these communities the the community the the the kind of individuals

05:34.000 --> 05:39.760
that are are collecting the royalty sort of benefit from volatility and that doesn't doesn't

05:39.760 --> 05:47.120
seem like you know like a sustainable kind of long-term trajectory trajectory so no I I think like

05:47.120 --> 05:55.200
the the fact that you can just like creators can create new work and and sort of dilute the money

05:55.200 --> 06:00.560
supply at any time gives them a tremendous amount of earning power and we've already seen evidence

06:00.560 --> 06:10.480
of that right you know like some of these like X copy open editions I believe that was one of

06:10.480 --> 06:23.360
the art blocks creators recently you know made like 12 million dollars or something in a day by

06:23.360 --> 06:31.360
creating new work I just don't see the need for kind of taxing the money supply as as like an

06:31.360 --> 06:41.760
additional mechanism for for for income when it creates so many kind of undesirable effect does

06:41.760 --> 06:48.400
you're basically saying artists can monetize to additional primary sales and then what would

06:48.400 --> 06:54.880
you say to an artist that said oh look you just you mentioned X copy you mentioned Tyler Hobbs

06:54.880 --> 07:03.200
okay fine I mean I'm pretty sure under all scenarios of any scenario of the world X copy and

07:03.200 --> 07:11.040
Tyler Hobbs are of course perfectly capable of monetizing their reputation any point in time

07:11.040 --> 07:16.640
because their reputation is stellar they're the top of their field but a lot of artists struggle

07:16.640 --> 07:22.640
to make primary sales right and they're saying well maybe this doesn't apply in the same way to

07:22.640 --> 07:29.600
me how should they think about it how should they organize themselves if I mean I think in a sense

07:29.600 --> 07:34.880
what we're saying here is that like successful people make lots of money and unsuccessful people

07:34.880 --> 07:43.120
won't you know like I think like the the sort of structure I described is like kind of holds

07:44.560 --> 07:49.920
in all cases right like if you're successful at making primary sales you you would probably

07:49.920 --> 07:54.800
make a lot of royalties and if you're unsuccessful at making primary sales you probably you probably

07:54.800 --> 07:59.840
also wouldn't wouldn't make a lot of royalties I think the reality is that you know this this is

08:02.240 --> 08:08.480
the cost of producing NFTs is very low this is it is a very very competitive marketplace

08:09.520 --> 08:16.240
and and it's it's an entrepreneurial marketplace you know just like YouTube was and is just like

08:16.240 --> 08:24.800
a lot of other sorts of markets are and and you know I think it's a sad reality but the fact is

08:24.800 --> 08:32.480
that not everyone's going to make it the people that do make it if if they those people that do

08:32.480 --> 08:36.720
make it could monetize with royalties they can also monetize with with primary sales and I think

08:36.720 --> 08:40.880
they can they can do that better and if you if you can't make it with primary sales it seems

08:40.880 --> 08:45.600
very unlikely to me that royalties would help the only scenario that that this actually captures is

08:45.600 --> 08:53.920
this scenario where you like for example you create a lot of early work and then for some reason

08:53.920 --> 08:57.920
you're unable to produce additional work and people discover your early work and it becomes

08:57.920 --> 09:04.880
tremendously valuable and you sort of have have no way to kind of monetize what you did in the past

09:04.880 --> 09:08.400
I mean the way to defend against that is is sort of like keep some NFTs for yourself

09:08.400 --> 09:15.120
um that that's that's one possible solution but you know the the royalties in this case really

09:15.120 --> 09:21.040
cover just a very narrow set of circumstances that that I don't think like everyone

09:21.040 --> 09:42.480
on average should be designing for okay next perfect sense let me ask you you mentioned the word

09:43.120 --> 09:47.120
social token sometimes social currency what do you mean by that

09:47.120 --> 09:57.840
I mean I I think largely that's what NFTs are um you know they again all of this is sort of

09:57.840 --> 10:05.680
happening um in the context of of blockchains in the context of like the world kind of moving from

10:07.760 --> 10:15.040
governments having a monopoly on on money to kind of individuals and kind of entrepreneurs

10:15.040 --> 10:21.200
and communities being able to create their own currencies and I think there's a very real sense in

10:21.200 --> 10:27.440
which you know these these kind of artists one one of ones that that these are that these are

10:27.440 --> 10:33.760
kind of artists artists currencies or social currencies for individuals you know and there's

10:33.760 --> 10:38.080
lots of evidence for this right like if you look at this sort of like correlation between

10:38.080 --> 10:45.280
and of social media success and uh and kind of NFT value um you know I I think um it's kind of evidence

10:45.280 --> 10:52.720
that that what is being bought and sold in a sense is is attention and attention kind of as it relates

10:52.720 --> 10:59.840
to an individual so I do think you know that that's a reasonably good model for for looking at

10:59.840 --> 11:05.760
what is happening in the space you know we're moving from a world where you know governments

11:05.760 --> 11:15.520
create currencies that kind of look and act in like pretty boring sort of uh objects and artists

11:15.520 --> 11:21.600
are are creating currencies that look and act in much more interesting ways and there's some

11:21.600 --> 11:27.360
small level of adoption happening where people are willing to kind of use these as as

11:27.360 --> 11:32.240
stores of value and use them to transact and use them to to you know do social signaling all

11:32.240 --> 11:39.040
sorts of other things um and that that that's really to a large extent what what we're we're

11:39.040 --> 11:46.000
witnessing in the NFT space so I was having this discussion with Vincent Vandell and

11:47.760 --> 11:55.120
he had the following concern about this terminology under a nor it's very clear that if you make a

11:55.120 --> 11:59.200
piece of one of one art which a lot of what artists think they're doing right they're making one of one

11:59.200 --> 12:05.440
art this is not anything that has any regulatory implications right like it's protected by the

12:05.440 --> 12:10.800
first amendment it's obviously not a security ex copy makes a piece of digital art

12:15.440 --> 12:23.040
Vincent this is no different than someone meant to you know painting a painting and selling it

12:23.040 --> 12:27.760
no one has ever crossed their mind that these things might be securities if we start saying

12:27.760 --> 12:34.080
all other currencies there competing with other currencies or financial instruments would have you

12:34.080 --> 12:43.600
do we risk either mischaracterizing them to our detriment or people start doing things with them

12:43.600 --> 12:52.320
that then end up edging more towards the regulated financial services side of crypto and

12:52.320 --> 13:00.000
all of a sudden something that as far as I can tell should have no no regulatory implications for

13:00.000 --> 13:05.280
an artist minting a photograph right if they're doing the social currency and do I don't know

13:05.280 --> 13:10.240
what it would be something that looks more like an American security all of a sudden we get back

13:10.240 --> 13:15.840
into the world of registration and as you see it what have you is there what's your view on this

13:15.840 --> 13:23.200
yeah I mean I don't think I have a super strong view because I just don't have a lot of

13:23.200 --> 13:31.440
expertise in that domain I would like my intuition is that one like what what we call them

13:31.440 --> 13:38.320
doesn't really matter you know in the long run they either are or they're not securities financial

13:38.320 --> 13:47.920
assets what you know what whatever I mean I think you know outside of the outside of the context

13:47.920 --> 13:54.080
of like you know how regulators look at them I think that they are completely new things you know

13:54.080 --> 14:00.800
that have they have properties of many different things and that it's generally overly simplistic

14:00.800 --> 14:09.360
to think of them as you know A or B or X or Y like there are many things simultaneously and

14:09.360 --> 14:14.320
that's what makes them interesting I also think the sort of long-term trajectory of this space is

14:15.120 --> 14:20.800
probably some some sort of like revolutionary type confrontation with regulators with with

14:20.800 --> 14:26.240
governments because it just seems inevitable to me that you know that that one of the most

14:26.240 --> 14:31.520
powerful things that the technology does is it it kind of democratizes the ability to create

14:31.520 --> 14:37.360
currency and when that kind of butts up against you know the government's sort of ability to monopolize

14:37.360 --> 14:44.480
currency that it's going to be confrontational so I think that sort of confrontation is inevitable

14:44.480 --> 14:50.800
no matter what we call these things and you know we should do them the service of naming them the

14:50.800 --> 14:57.280
thing that describes them best versus kind of trying trying to be dishonest about it for for fear

14:57.280 --> 15:02.320
of of how regulators will look at them we we've already seen sort of like the negative implications

15:02.320 --> 15:06.960
of of that with respect to governments governance tokens and people being kind of intellectually

15:06.960 --> 15:12.080
dishonest about about like what what things are so I think it's just good to call them what they are

15:12.080 --> 15:20.160
okay I think that's a fair fair question let me a fair answer let me ask you this it's 20 years

15:20.160 --> 15:30.480
from now now and so right about minting now 7300 or something that's where we'll be in 20 years

15:33.760 --> 15:40.800
in your best case outcome vision of what 20 years from now the future looks like for

15:40.800 --> 15:50.560
knowledge and the picture what what does it look like yeah so I think the most interesting case

15:50.560 --> 15:56.720
for nouns in the very long term is is that they emerge as something like the first network state

15:56.720 --> 16:04.080
you know they each noun becomes a very kind of large community of its own and that you know

16:04.080 --> 16:10.000
that the nouns down the kind of organization that that glues them all together is the meta-organization

16:10.000 --> 16:15.280
you know it's it's kind of like the the UN or you know it's the body where they all kind of coordinate

16:15.920 --> 16:21.760
the activity between you know these very very large internet communities I think in that scenario

16:21.760 --> 16:28.400
you know the the treasury that that these communities have access to is quite large probably

16:28.400 --> 16:33.440
measured in the tens or hundreds of billions and that this this treasury can be used to to kind

16:33.440 --> 16:40.640
of at this time go well beyond proliferating the meme and and start being used to actually build

16:40.640 --> 16:44.640
public infrastructure to build public goods and you know we we already do this at a very small

16:45.440 --> 16:53.760
scale but you know I I think there um the optionality kind of exists within the structure

16:53.760 --> 16:59.120
for this to emerge it's it's very early and there's a lot of work that we have to do

16:59.120 --> 17:06.240
um towards that goal um and and you know as with any sort of crypto it's all very risky and novel

17:06.240 --> 17:10.560
and there's lots of things that could go go wrong on the way but I think in the case where everything

17:10.560 --> 17:16.560
goes right and in the case where you know the internet sort of continues to to become more important

17:16.560 --> 17:22.080
and blockchains kind of continue to become more important as the as the way we we govern how the

17:22.080 --> 17:27.520
world works I think it would be very very interesting if nouns or something like nouns

17:27.520 --> 17:35.440
uh emerged as as one of the key pieces of of governance infrastructure and public goods funding

17:35.440 --> 17:39.920
and that that got linked back to the world and and could do a whole bunch of good there um that

17:39.920 --> 17:42.160
that's kind of the most exciting vision I can think of for the project

17:43.600 --> 17:48.960
you had tweeted something I think a few days ago then every time someone

17:50.080 --> 17:55.120
talks about the book value of the treasury you wanted to give a million dollars the treasure away

17:55.120 --> 18:01.040
something something along those lines if and now you're saying about the treasury being for

18:02.240 --> 18:10.240
public goods how should noun holders think about the treasure is it something like it's end

18:10.240 --> 18:15.600
endowment of a not for profit and they need to be used just to promote nouns and then along

18:15.600 --> 18:22.160
with other public goods it's not and by extension it's not something say oh look we have this

18:22.160 --> 18:27.920
pile of leaflets pay ourselves a dividend is is that what was implied in that book value

18:29.120 --> 18:39.040
treat yeah I mean um I I think on on on my twitter and and just generally I'm very kind of public

18:39.040 --> 18:45.360
in in kind of working through uh these problems in my own head I I don't know that that this was

18:45.360 --> 18:51.200
any sort of definitive statement about how uh how the treasury should be used it it was really

18:51.200 --> 18:56.000
just largely how I was feeling at the moment that you know my my personal sense and again you

18:56.000 --> 19:02.080
know I'm I guess there's there's a sense in which I'm maybe a spiritual leader of the community

19:02.080 --> 19:07.200
but there's also a sense in which I can be very wrong and I'm also you know my my only kind of hard

19:07.200 --> 19:13.520
power here is the number of of noun votes that I have which is you know I'm not I'm not even close

19:13.520 --> 19:19.120
to the largest holder um and and so you know it I think in that moment I was feeling like

19:19.120 --> 19:26.880
um as a community we we had had sort of  stopped being as aggressive as we were with with

19:26.880 --> 19:30.720
funding public goods and kind of funding charitable endeavors which I think for a whole bunch

19:30.720 --> 19:33.840
of other reasons that we haven't discussed is like something that's very very important for

19:33.840 --> 19:40.400
for crypto and blockchains to do um so I I was just kind of vocalizing um you know I I guess maybe

19:40.400 --> 19:47.120
in the way I do sometimes very strongly my my opinion that um you know we we we could move back

19:47.120 --> 19:54.480
in in that direction um but you know I I think it's ultimately up to uh all all noun holders to

19:54.480 --> 19:58.720
to kind of collectively figure out what it is the project should do I think the thing that makes

19:58.720 --> 20:03.360
it interesting is that it's permissionless um and and the thing that makes it interesting is that

20:03.360 --> 20:09.280
it's it's the competing visions of of of all the owners and all of the members you know it um that

20:09.280 --> 20:14.000
that determine what the organization will do you know I I think you can really think about the

20:14.000 --> 20:19.200
kind of disbursement of the treasury as sort of like a function right and that function like the

20:20.720 --> 20:29.920
the thing it reacts to is is sort of like the overlapping area as of of all of the venn diagrams

20:29.920 --> 20:34.720
of of of of all of the owners and and what they want to do there's that space in the middle where

20:34.720 --> 20:39.920
we all agree that that this is something valuable and and and and the treasury is like a function

20:39.920 --> 20:44.160
that that executes that thing um so I I mean I think that that's probably the right way to think

20:44.160 --> 20:49.760
about it long term um and then you know I I I continued to kind of inject my opinion as opinions as

20:49.760 --> 20:57.280
as they kind of uh form okay and then I think not exactly related but sort of related

20:59.280 --> 21:04.480
you're in the process I guess it has been decided to do something that I believe to most

21:04.480 --> 21:11.920
projects would be inconceivable which is you're going to delete the discord and the logic

21:13.040 --> 21:21.920
if I understood it correctly was to to theories one theory is in time of bounds becomes super

21:21.920 --> 21:28.800
successful that official discord is going to be very powerful ground I guess I kind of what

21:28.800 --> 21:37.280
happened with bitcoin dot com and uh uh in the bitcoin area are so yeah right and so it's

21:37.280 --> 21:45.840
going to be fine our bitcoin and it's going to be fought over and maybe not in a way that aligns

21:45.840 --> 21:51.360
with the real project who gets to run that discord what views happen in that discord and then

21:51.360 --> 21:59.840
you also said something that like the mix of people who were involved for culture and development

21:59.840 --> 22:08.240
versus for financial purposes in a way the discord management is a subsidy from those involved

22:08.240 --> 22:14.320
in the culture and operations to those who are just in it for financial return how do how do

22:14.320 --> 22:18.560
we think about that and I guess the discord is going away is that is the decision been made

22:18.560 --> 22:23.600
yeah that's right so uh how Halloween October 31st will be the last last day of the

22:23.600 --> 22:29.760
quote unquote official nouns discord and again you know I think a lot of my public comments are

22:29.760 --> 22:37.040
me me trying to work through a lot of these things in in my head um I you know I I think the

22:37.520 --> 22:43.120
I think the reality is that it as as quote unquote neutral territory it already was being

22:43.120 --> 22:47.520
fought over it was being fought over in in very subtle ways but you know that I think that dynamic

22:47.520 --> 22:55.440
already did exist and and yeah I think it was just ultimately something that um again in these

22:55.440 --> 23:01.920
very nuanced ways was was kind of unhealthy for for the community and and making it a less fun

23:01.920 --> 23:07.280
and productive place to be than than it otherwise was and otherwise would be um and I think yeah

23:07.280 --> 23:15.840
the the the factors that there are already um dozens if not more um uh discussion forums where

23:15.840 --> 23:21.440
you know there's there's like very interesting and productive discussion that is taking place

23:21.440 --> 23:27.520
about nouns and those spaces have points of view and so they're not fought over right they don't

23:27.520 --> 23:32.160
they don't pretend to be neutral um and it's just a much more healthy and productive thing for the

23:32.160 --> 23:37.120
community to kind of disperse into those spaces and then ultimately for us to to kind of come back

23:37.120 --> 23:44.560
and meet on chain uh and and really have have our discussions um about the governance of the protocol

23:44.560 --> 23:52.880
in a place where um those discussions have like weight where they have meaning right where where like

23:52.880 --> 23:59.360
um in in in essence these votes um are a place where where kind of like words and actions are the

23:59.360 --> 24:03.920
same thing or or these proposals are a place where words and actions are the same thing um and

24:03.920 --> 24:08.560
that is not necessarily happening in the discord you know I think I think if you if you sort of like

24:09.360 --> 24:13.520
just looked into the discord and and tried to take the temperature in there based on on the

24:13.520 --> 24:17.840
discussion that was happening as to whether we should shut down the discord or not you know you

24:17.840 --> 24:22.000
you would have had an intuitive sense that people were kind of overwhelmingly against it

24:22.000 --> 24:28.480
but on on you know the noun owners call when when someone kind of like took the temperature of

24:28.480 --> 24:35.680
of actual owners um I think the uh uh the vote was um you know it was it was a smaller call but

24:35.680 --> 24:40.960
the the vote was like you know something like 20 to four uh in in favor of shutting it down

24:40.960 --> 24:46.640
so again this this is the way in which the uh the the supposedly neutral space can become

24:46.640 --> 24:53.360
contested right and like obviously the people that um kind of benefit the most from taking over

24:53.360 --> 24:57.840
that neutral space would be would be in favor of keeping it um and and so you you can see there's

24:57.840 --> 25:02.800
kind of hard evidence right there that that this is an unhealthy unhealthy kind of dynamic for the

25:02.800 --> 25:06.800
community so I think it's ultimately a great thing that we're shutting it down you know and I

25:06.800 --> 25:13.600
I think ultimately if if the protocol can't survive um the the the end of a single discord server

25:13.600 --> 25:18.640
then then it doesn't really deserve to survive so I you know I I think it is quite quite robust

25:18.640 --> 25:23.520
in certain ways and and we're we're already seeing just like a lot of a lot of new discords popping

25:23.520 --> 25:28.560
up and a lot of more interesting conversations happening so I I do think ultimately we'll look

25:28.560 --> 25:36.160
back and see that it was the right move okay it's taken up a lot of your time so we're gonna end

25:36.160 --> 25:42.000
with one question which is what's the question that I should have asked but didn't ask

25:42.000 --> 25:45.920
what's the thing that you'd like to close on and the thing that we we didn't cover but I should

25:45.920 --> 25:55.040
have asked that we should have covered um I'd say maybe just with with respect to the cc zero stuff

25:55.040 --> 26:04.320
like I think a lot of the conversation um always kind of revolves around ownership and licenses

26:04.320 --> 26:10.080
and you know what's right and what's wrong I think one of the thing that things that's like really

26:10.080 --> 26:19.360
frequently neglected is just like how awesome remix culture is um you know but but like

26:20.000 --> 26:24.800
certainly at the at the peak of like the NFT frenzy you know people were just doing so many cool

26:24.800 --> 26:29.040
things with punks like remixing them and all sorts of fun and interesting ways and that that

26:29.040 --> 26:34.320
remix culture uh in in the nouns community is super super strong and and people are always making just

26:34.320 --> 26:38.800
like incredible things and I think this sort of remix culture is just very very native to the

26:38.800 --> 26:45.840
internet it's just like it's it's a it's a place where people want to take things and synthesize them

26:45.840 --> 26:51.680
and and you know uh have fun with them and play with them and proliferate them so I I think maybe

26:51.680 --> 26:58.720
like the the most important reason um to be kind of bullish on on cc zero it is that you know and

26:58.720 --> 27:03.920
and if he's actually allowed this sort of remix culture to be monetized uh in in ways that are

27:03.920 --> 27:10.720
going to produce like really really fun and and refreshing and and in great culture um so I

27:10.720 --> 27:16.000
think it's it's really important not to lose sight of that uh I couldn't agree more and in some

27:16.000 --> 27:23.600
ways it's interesting and we have just not gotten the story yeah as a field the idea that

27:25.120 --> 27:33.440
a collector is willing to spend money to in effect keep artists working and then also at the

27:33.440 --> 27:39.920
same time make that art available to the global public commons seems like literally the best case

27:39.920 --> 27:46.400
outcome for the world of large right literally something that people should be very happy about and

27:47.360 --> 27:53.760
that message hasn't gotten out I mean but people who are not into the NFT space and sometimes they

27:53.760 --> 27:59.680
argue with me on twitter and I try to be helpful and they say well I mean just you don't know

27:59.680 --> 28:05.760
anything right that's just the kind of thing and kind of my view is like what are you doing if I'm

28:05.760 --> 28:14.080
happy owning a token or a piece of art that cc zero who's the victim here I mean the artist has

28:14.800 --> 28:22.320
gotten money for their work literally the rest of the planet has this art to play with and for some

28:22.320 --> 28:28.640
reason then a rich collector is the victim who's the actual victim I'm the victim I show you

28:28.640 --> 28:34.320
I'm not the victim and if I'm not the victim what's the victim of this and but people struggle it

28:34.320 --> 28:39.920
struggle with it I think and I think it doesn't mean all art should be cc zero right people should

28:39.920 --> 28:45.040
each artist should use whatever license they want but cc zero art I think does have the

28:45.040 --> 28:53.840
dynamic that in effect everyone I think is winning and I don't see who's possibly losing and so

28:54.640 --> 29:01.680
we probably agree on this is that fair yeah yeah I agree very strongly you know I think one one

29:01.680 --> 29:07.200
interesting way to frame it and and I think I have to run in a minute so I don't have time to get

29:07.200 --> 29:15.200
into it but I think the two like two of the killer apps of blockchains are NFTs and public goods

29:16.000 --> 29:20.720
and and the kind of the intersection between those things is just very very fruitful

29:20.720 --> 29:27.600
fruitful space and and I think thinking about the cc zero conversation in that context

29:27.600 --> 29:35.600
it is maybe a really nice way to think about it and and kind of leads you to to a lot of these

29:35.600 --> 29:43.360
conclusions okay well thank you again so much for your time this was excellent and look forward

29:43.360 --> 29:49.360
to seeing what happens in the mountains ecosystem as things evolve yeah thank you and really looking

29:49.360 --> 29:55.200
forward to the kind of Q&A that's a response to to this conversation so thanks again for having

29:55.200 --> 30:06.640
me this is a lot of fun

30:15.760 --> 30:22.800
hi everyone I thought that was a great session and very generously 4156

30:22.800 --> 30:27.440
I can stay a few minutes now post a session and answer some of your questions

30:27.440 --> 30:36.240
4156 are you there can you hear us yeah here good morning how are you great great I am

30:36.240 --> 30:42.320
mostly going to stay out of this because I think this people want to hear from you I think some

30:42.320 --> 30:50.720
people some questions will be put here in the chat in the chat in the studio where we are

30:50.720 --> 30:59.360
and what I'd like to ask people to do is also post their questions now in the on chat and then

30:59.360 --> 31:06.240
some of the team members will try and feed them up here and I'll only intervene if we get confused

31:06.240 --> 31:11.840
otherwise I mean I think the floor is yours 4156 and there's a couple of I think fairly straightforward

31:11.840 --> 31:16.160
questions to start with and we'll see what else we got sure sorry so you want me to read the

31:16.160 --> 31:22.000
questions or you're going to you're going to curate them in the region I think you can just read them

31:22.000 --> 31:27.440
as little as you like okay sure I see two two questions here correct and I'm going to go look for more

31:27.440 --> 31:37.120
we're going to see what else is out there okay all right so I'm just going to review some talk I guess

31:38.320 --> 31:45.120
it's kind of hard to get a sense of what the feedback is but we'll give this a try okay so

31:45.120 --> 31:51.680
question 4156 is the revenue of the noun staff shared among the founders in the no so safe only

31:51.680 --> 32:00.160
or is it also shared with the community so there is there is no no so safe the nouns now is kind

32:00.160 --> 32:11.120
of an instance of compound governance so 100% of the auction proceeds when when somebody buys a

32:11.120 --> 32:20.000
noun flow into the Dow so the the founders actually receive none of that what the founders do get

32:20.000 --> 32:26.000
is every 10th noun for the first five years of the project so if you go and you watch the

32:26.000 --> 32:34.160
noun options you know when you get to noun I don't know 419 you'll notice that noun 420

32:34.160 --> 32:39.920
isn't actually option just sent directly to the founders of the project and then the option

32:39.920 --> 32:48.160
skips to now 421 so 100% of the proceeds go into the Dow zero to the founders what the founders

32:48.160 --> 32:53.760
get is is every 10th noun for the first five years and after that that kind of quote unquote

32:53.760 --> 33:00.880
nounters reward is is finished the founders aren't capturing anymore sort of value from from

33:00.880 --> 33:08.560
the project and 100% of the proceeds go to the Dow 0.456 if I have a noun what are the expected

33:08.560 --> 33:14.320
utilities apart from the voting right I'm sorry this moved and the potential price upside of

33:14.320 --> 33:21.440
the noun NFT I owned if I only have one noun and I'm not selling is is is it only the voting

33:21.440 --> 33:28.800
right I get yeah so I mean I think the interesting thing about nouns is that probably unlike most

33:28.800 --> 33:37.600
other NFT projects all of the value is created by the community so so you know in essence like

33:37.600 --> 33:43.440
when you ask the question what what do I get the answer is really you know what whatever it is

33:43.440 --> 33:49.280
that you're sort of willing to contribute and and you know the the net benefit of all all the

33:49.280 --> 33:56.640
other the contributions of the of the other noun owners and and whatever one sort of collectively

33:56.640 --> 34:02.880
decides to do with the treasury you know and in in in literal terms what what you're getting is

34:02.880 --> 34:08.960
you're you're getting the NFT and the NFT lets you have one vote kind of to to help direct the

34:08.960 --> 34:16.720
treasury you know everything else by design is kind of as open as possible so you know this is

34:16.720 --> 34:23.680
really sort of bullish on the notion of NFTs as digital originals so you sort of own the

34:23.680 --> 34:29.600
provenance of of you know a real noun and an OG noun you know to the extent that you think

34:29.600 --> 34:35.520
that token on its own is valuable independent of any sort of like you know IP rights or or you

34:35.520 --> 34:41.760
know discord rights or anything else kind of conferred upon you you know and most of those things

34:41.760 --> 34:48.960
are absent what is present is you know the ability to vote to govern the DAO and and the ownership

34:48.960 --> 34:58.480
of of the the digital original okay I read a while back about nouns starting and nouns starter

34:58.480 --> 35:05.200
project for new noun style DAO's to try the experiment but with more specific goals or orientation

35:05.200 --> 35:13.120
could you elaborate on that yeah so that project is actually coming from Jacob Horn and and

35:13.920 --> 35:21.520
and Zora it's called nouns builder I believe it's launching very soon you know I think I believe

35:21.520 --> 35:25.760
they have they have a twitter that you can follow I'm not running that project or you know

35:25.760 --> 35:32.880
haven't been following it super super closely so Jacob or nouns builder would you know that they

35:32.880 --> 35:38.080
would be the people to kind of chat with about that but yeah you know I think this idea of sort

35:38.080 --> 35:45.520
of like commoditizing the you know the ability to create nounish DAO's is super interesting

35:45.520 --> 35:50.720
and you know to the extent that we've seen a lot of success with the first instance of the model

35:50.720 --> 35:57.520
I would expect that we'll see success with other instances of the model and of course the very

35:57.520 --> 36:02.240
very interesting thing is is like when all of these things are sort of networked in the long run

36:02.240 --> 36:07.840
and and able to kind of you know vote on each other's proposals call functions on each other

36:07.840 --> 36:15.520
I think that starts to get it and that that sort of like vision for you know like a governance

36:15.520 --> 36:20.640
layer of of the internet or or the metaverse or whatever you want to call it in the long run I think

36:20.640 --> 36:28.080
that's going to be super interesting that question can you show how you analyze a project

36:29.520 --> 36:35.840
I guess that's with respect to like just discovering other NFT projects and like thinking about

36:35.840 --> 36:41.920
are they valuable or not I mean I can I guess I can talk more generally about this and by the way

36:41.920 --> 36:47.680
if if that someone is out there with feedback it's still like which of these questions they want

36:47.680 --> 36:52.880
more more time spent on just let me know I feel like I'm just kind of talking into the boy gear

36:52.880 --> 36:58.480
which I'm okay with but as long as this is interesting can you show how you analyze a project

36:58.480 --> 37:07.200
right so I mean I think maybe the the way I think about things is after a lot of years kind of

37:07.200 --> 37:12.320
investing in financial markets like I think they're just kind of typically some signs that you can

37:12.320 --> 37:17.280
look for that you know something a value is being created and I think this stuff is sort of

37:17.280 --> 37:22.880
generalizable between traditional financial markets and a few projects sort of like venture capital

37:23.920 --> 37:30.720
I mean in general I would say that like one of the things that I use before committing capital

37:30.720 --> 37:41.280
or time to something is like you know am I obsessed with it I typically I'm like very very selective

37:41.280 --> 37:48.880
about things I invest in and those things are typically also things that I'm willing to spend

37:49.680 --> 37:56.160
a lot of time on personally you know so I don't know like just as a as an example like

37:56.160 --> 38:04.080
you know way back I guess several years ago now when I invested in Tesla early on you know I

38:04.080 --> 38:08.640
like had become obsessed with the company I was like I sat in my friend's Tesla I was like you

38:08.640 --> 38:14.720
know this is like being in a rocket ship you know I eventually bought one and you know like

38:15.360 --> 38:19.280
there's like a deep understanding that comes from that that sort of obsession that was true

38:19.280 --> 38:24.960
with Bitcoin and Ethereum and true for NFTs as well so it's you know it's I think personally it's

38:24.960 --> 38:32.000
less about like you know kind of scouring the internet for like something that you think nobody

38:32.000 --> 38:39.920
else has discovered yet and it's more about kind of bouncing around online until you find something

38:39.920 --> 38:46.160
that you become obsessed with and then you know you can eventually sort of you'll find natural

38:46.160 --> 38:52.960
ways to monetize it if you become obsessed with it and you know sometimes those things won't

38:52.960 --> 38:59.040
necessarily even be investible like you know if if you're like obsessed with stable diffusion right

38:59.040 --> 39:06.480
now like maybe you could build a business around it for for example so I think you know it's really

39:06.480 --> 39:10.640
about being sort of selective and then about committing your time and your capital to things that

39:11.520 --> 39:18.160
you know kind of peak your interests and where you see an awful lot of depth versus just you know

39:18.160 --> 39:23.520
hanging out and looking for the next board apes and you know throwing like 5% of your portfolio at each

39:23.520 --> 39:32.800
one of these do you think it's a good idea to use the nouns governance model but for something

39:32.800 --> 39:38.160
unrelated to nouns generative art every day forever where that treasury is used to acquire generative art

39:38.160 --> 39:42.240
yeah I think so and you know maybe I just want to spend a ton of time on this one because as it relates

39:42.240 --> 39:51.120
to the 6529 question above you know that I think we're about to see what happens when you sort of

39:51.120 --> 39:56.080
like generalize this infrastructure and you start forming communities with different kinds of

39:56.080 --> 40:01.200
objectives I would add to that like you know one of the really interesting things about the original

40:02.000 --> 40:08.480
instance of nouns it is that it's sort of that it doesn't have an objective but that like the

40:08.480 --> 40:14.560
objective is sort of driven primarily by the art and the meme and the feeling of the community

40:14.560 --> 40:20.560
so like that the objective is an emergent property I'm not sure like I think it will be interesting

40:20.560 --> 40:26.960
to see how it works when you know the the objective is kind of more explicitly stated at the

40:26.960 --> 40:32.240
outset and of course I think we're going to see a mix of these these nounish dows with with

40:32.240 --> 40:42.480
explicit and and then sort of emergent objectives okay next question you currently have a treasury

40:42.480 --> 40:47.200
of approximately 30,000 teeth accrued from more than a year what are your short and long term

40:47.200 --> 40:53.840
plans for the funds again you know I do sort of think of the dows as a function that you know

40:53.840 --> 41:02.880
bit based on the kind of interests of like the places where the interests of the down members

41:02.880 --> 41:10.960
overlap that that's kind of what the funds will be allocated for you know as as for sort of my

41:10.960 --> 41:17.280
own opinion you know I do think there's a sense in which like the the treasury is kind of misunderstood

41:17.280 --> 41:23.840
like you hear a lot of people kind of that don't know much about the project you know talk about how

41:23.840 --> 41:27.840
you know the the the funds haven't been used yet and that's like some some sort of like horrible

41:27.840 --> 41:34.000
misallocation you know or like they've been squandered or you know the sort of like kind of nonsense

41:34.000 --> 41:40.160
I think you know I do think there's a sense in which the treasury is the sort of like

41:40.160 --> 41:48.240
um it's like the the federal reserve of the nouns right like the reserve assets aren't

41:48.240 --> 41:55.520
necessarily there to be spent immediately what they're therefore is to kind of reinforce the

41:55.520 --> 42:03.840
caliber or the quality or the long term nature you know or the credibility of of of the protocol

42:03.840 --> 42:12.160
um and and you know I think yes like proposals passed that that sort of um at disperse you know

42:12.160 --> 42:17.360
a certain percentage of of those funds every month every year but you know I I think there's

42:17.360 --> 42:22.160
actually a lot of value especially sort of early on in the history of this thing um to to being

42:22.160 --> 42:27.440
pretty conservative with how the funds are used um to you know to use them in in ways that kind

42:27.440 --> 42:33.520
of run experiments and and sort of further the mission of the protocol but but really um I think

42:33.520 --> 42:40.640
there's a lot of value from um from the treasury just like sitting there at as the sort of meme and

42:40.640 --> 42:46.480
as as the sort of gold reserves of uh of the nouns ecosystem um and so in that sense I think you know

42:46.480 --> 42:52.240
it like it's more of a question of like what should we do with the treasury in in 10 years when

42:52.240 --> 42:57.920
when it's you know um in eth terms 10x larger and in via terms you know maybe a hundred or a thousand

42:57.920 --> 43:02.560
x larger you know what what what are the things that we could do at that point um that that seems

43:02.560 --> 43:10.560
like the most interesting question to me uh okay question seemed like small contradiction

43:12.400 --> 43:20.160
um between royalties view artist control long tail of supply versus provenance value early tokens

43:20.160 --> 43:35.760
matter more than trad art can you try to reconcile these okay let me think about this for a second

43:41.120 --> 43:46.880
oh I see like so it's like how should artists kind of like monetize their early work

43:46.880 --> 43:53.920
if if that's the most valuable stuff um yeah I mean that I guess that's an interesting point like um

43:53.920 --> 43:59.680
um I mean I would just say I think there's a lot of uncertainty kind of um in both those

43:59.680 --> 44:04.960
perspectives so it's kind of difficult to comment on on like what should artists do in case

44:04.960 --> 44:11.360
they overlap but I mean it is a valid point like if if if most of the the value kind of comes from

44:11.360 --> 44:18.160
early early tokens you know um how do artists sort of monetize those I mean I you know I would say

44:18.160 --> 44:23.520
it's it's less about like an individual artist early tokens and more about like the the early

44:23.520 --> 44:30.080
tokens of the NFT space I think kind of outside of those um you know very very early uh pieces

44:31.680 --> 44:38.880
um that that like you know we're minted in 2018 2019 etc like I think as you sort of move away

44:38.880 --> 44:46.080
from that era um it does become more kind of analogous to traditional art where it's about the

44:46.080 --> 44:49.920
the value of the individual piece versus like the you know the historic value of the token

44:52.400 --> 44:58.000
uh what is the best strategy for nouns in terms of fast and and widely and wide massive

44:58.000 --> 45:04.560
option in web 2 I mean again I think the best strategy for nouns is the strategy that the

45:04.560 --> 45:09.680
community kind of agrees upon right um but the interesting thing about it is that it's it's kind

45:09.680 --> 45:16.080
of like you know community created content um I will so one one of the things I was sort of uh

45:16.080 --> 45:21.840
kind of alluding to at the end of uh the conversation with 6529 um was the sort of like

45:21.840 --> 45:30.080
importance of uh public goods funding um and and kind of you know like I think I heard somebody

45:30.080 --> 45:34.480
call it I think they called it like warm crypto or warm blockchain I saw that just just one

45:34.480 --> 45:41.280
instance of that um but it seems like maybe a useful term you know um the this idea that um

45:43.600 --> 45:49.600
so okay so here's here's sort of an example right like if if if you um have right now

45:50.480 --> 45:55.600
a kind of like a CO2 negative Bitcoin right we're like every block that was mined

45:55.600 --> 46:02.560
um kind of removed CO2 from the atmosphere right I mean you can't do that but just imagine kind

46:02.560 --> 46:09.120
of um as a thought experiment that you could you know I think you would see like kind of relative

46:09.120 --> 46:16.240
to um kind of traditional sort of like environmental negative externality Bitcoin you would see like

46:16.240 --> 46:24.000
rapid adoption of of that version of Bitcoin right because because people sort of would collectively

46:24.000 --> 46:30.800
recognize that that the adoption is collectively good for the world um and and I think that sort

46:30.800 --> 46:37.600
of thinking with respect to crypto and blockchains is um probably super important and has been

46:38.640 --> 46:44.480
kind of undervalued and and under emphasized as a tool for mass adoption so I do think that

46:44.480 --> 46:54.320
this sort of like um like public goods funding as a method for proliferation and for mass adoption

46:54.320 --> 46:59.200
is pretty important because I think people need to see that this technology can be used for good

46:59.840 --> 47:07.520
and I think you know as as a kind of community um like the crypto space has really not

47:07.520 --> 47:11.920
not been created that right like the world has seen that a handful of people have gotten like

47:11.920 --> 47:18.560
absurdly wealthy um you know the the world has seen um you know that the huge sort of energy footprint

47:18.560 --> 47:24.320
approve of work but the world hasn't really seen and you know I think up to this point we have not

47:24.320 --> 47:31.840
done a great job of sort of like demonstrating the value for for people that don't necessarily

47:31.840 --> 47:37.200
own these tokens right like what what are the positive externalities that these systems can create

47:37.200 --> 47:42.720
so far they've they've sort of like hordered the profits and just it created negative externalities

47:42.720 --> 47:47.920
but I think from here if we want to see mass adoption we have to we have to create sort of positive

47:47.920 --> 48:07.920
externalities I think I'll in second I can I drink some water perhaps and I have a question

48:07.920 --> 48:12.160
but I think I heard that in exchange cannot honor royalties I presume that royalties were encoded

48:12.160 --> 48:19.200
into a smart contract and were always honored what am I missing I mean I think you probably like

48:19.200 --> 48:24.400
a someone with more kind of deep technical expertise about ethereum can answer this better than me

48:24.400 --> 48:31.760
but effectively you can you can always sort of create derivatives and sort of wrapper contracts

48:32.640 --> 48:38.400
that allow things to happen on ethereum um in in these kind of meta contracts that don't have

48:38.400 --> 48:44.640
to honor the royalties that that the original contract and has created you know it it's just like

48:44.640 --> 48:51.120
these systems are designed to be sort of like the ultimate ultimate free market infrastructure

48:51.760 --> 48:57.680
and and so it's it's very difficult in that context to to enforce a very specific

48:59.040 --> 49:07.360
sorts of constraints how well audited is your DAO smart contract um yeah so I mean audits are

49:07.360 --> 49:13.040
obviously super super important in this space um so that the the the actual um kind of

49:14.480 --> 49:18.720
governance module the infrastructure which which is you know the that's like the most critical

49:18.720 --> 49:26.320
piece of nouns is is a fork of compound uh governor bravo which itself you know has has been

49:26.960 --> 49:33.120
used for a long time and and undergone um uh you know significant audits and then all of the

49:33.120 --> 49:39.440
changes that we made to it um were audited by you know some of the best people in the space um the

49:39.440 --> 49:47.040
recent kind of V2 um of nouns that that uh was just deployed um that that um improves a

49:47.040 --> 49:55.040
upon a a couple of of the governance mechanisms uh underwent a cotorino audit um and yeah you know

49:55.040 --> 50:00.880
the the um the sort of technical nounism cells you know these are a large number of them um they're

50:00.880 --> 50:07.040
they're all kind of um very very elite developers um kind of at at at the top of the field so

50:07.760 --> 50:16.080
you know um those those smart contracts I would say are kind of as as uh well as well scrutinized as

50:16.080 --> 50:20.080
as sort of any other uh kind of critical piece of of infrastructure in this space

50:25.120 --> 50:28.400
uh do you feel there are still talented people willing to build on top of collections

50:28.400 --> 50:33.840
as they did following your nouns tweet um or the talented ones already made it and it's just

50:33.840 --> 50:38.960
as plebs left um I mean I I think that's actually a really good question especially the first half

50:38.960 --> 50:44.400
of it you know if if like I created that sort of nouns tweet today you know what what would the

50:44.400 --> 50:51.040
response be like um and and I do think this sort of like um speaks a little bit to the value of

50:51.040 --> 50:58.960
uh building and being present at in in bull markets right but like this sort of um there's the

50:58.960 --> 51:07.040
sort of like wild enthusiasm for trying new things in the context of of media all of that said um

51:07.040 --> 51:13.440
you know I I think we were very lucky um when we all got together to build nouns that we had a

51:13.440 --> 51:18.880
group of people that were not concerned with kind of instantaneous monetization um and and really

51:18.880 --> 51:25.360
like thinking um about building something for the long term um and and I think that you know that

51:25.360 --> 51:32.320
sort of um that sort of outcome is probably much more rare that during during a bull market

51:32.320 --> 51:36.720
so I think like maybe the answer is twofold like on one hand it's a lot easier to get get people

51:36.720 --> 51:42.160
together to try new stuff on the other hand it's a lot more difficult and like I think we were

51:42.160 --> 51:47.200
pretty lucky with respect to getting people that were willing to build for the long term you know

51:47.200 --> 51:53.680
like in um in kind of measurable terms that group of people probably could have you know we could have

51:54.320 --> 52:00.160
if we wanted to kind of monetize something short term in the midst of that mania you know we

52:00.160 --> 52:06.320
we probably could have made tens of millions of dollars or more um by by just you know focusing

52:06.320 --> 52:12.640
on that objective so you know we all kind of chose to to kind of leave a lot of money on the table

52:12.640 --> 52:18.000
to to try to build something interesting and kind of focused on the long term and and I think

52:18.640 --> 52:22.480
it's easier to find people that are willing to do that in a bear market than a bull market

52:22.480 --> 52:29.520
even if it is kind of more difficult to to get them all together um are there specific ways cc 0

52:29.520 --> 52:35.920
artists might model their career in managed ways other than treasury for proliferation

52:35.920 --> 52:47.200
um other specific way cc 0 artists might model their career in managed ways other than a treasury

52:47.200 --> 52:56.240
for proliferation so I guess is if the question is like what are the ways that cc 0 artists can kind of

52:56.240 --> 53:05.040
like monetize their work I mean I I think the answer there is like really just native to NFTs

53:05.040 --> 53:14.160
like do you believe that selling digital originals it is valuable um I guess if if the question is

53:14.160 --> 53:20.240
more related to setting up sort of like instances like new instances of announced out with with

53:20.240 --> 53:32.000
nouns builder um I mean you know um I think that the model of kind of keeping every you know

53:32.000 --> 53:40.160
nth uh NFT for yourself um and letting all of the value flow to the treasury is probably

53:40.720 --> 53:46.640
difficult for an artist that's starting out and it's it's probably like a structure that that's

53:46.640 --> 53:52.240
more well suited suited to to kind of communities that want to do work together uh question as the

53:52.240 --> 53:57.120
supply of nouns keeps increasing is the thesis that newer minted nouns will become less valuable

53:57.120 --> 54:02.880
and the OG nouns will maintain higher value so I mean I think certainly that that's possible if

54:02.880 --> 54:10.640
if the sort of like timestamp theory is correct um you know that that said I I do think you know

54:10.640 --> 54:14.560
and it's sort of like difficult to speculate on on where the value will come from because again it

54:14.560 --> 54:21.200
it it is really community driven um but but I do think like in in the long term um the value is

54:21.200 --> 54:26.640
this sort of like combination of of provenance right like you belong to the original original

54:26.640 --> 54:33.360
instance of nouns of which there are now you know hundreds of thousands of sort of like uh copies

54:33.360 --> 54:40.000
of that organization out in the world doing doing various things um and and um and then also sort

54:40.000 --> 54:44.960
of like the you know the the membership and community value you know what what does it mean to be

54:44.960 --> 54:52.320
to have a vote kind of um in in that in that protocol um what what does it mean to sort of be able

54:52.320 --> 54:59.360
to direct that treasury uh and to have the the sort of like um status of of being being part of

54:59.360 --> 55:06.800
that uh that organization um and and you know I I do think um you know people kind of frequently

55:06.800 --> 55:12.160
look at this idea that uh the the supply is infinite and assume that that causes it to to trend

55:12.160 --> 55:17.440
to zero in a long term um you know like one one down every day is it's it's it's a very very

55:17.440 --> 55:23.680
kind of slow trickle of new supply uh it takes about 27 years to to get to the market cap of um

55:23.680 --> 55:29.840
or sorry to to get to the um the number of instances of nouns um that are like equivalent to the

55:29.840 --> 55:35.840
the total supply of pawns or board apes etc uh and and you know if if you certainly like look at the

55:35.840 --> 55:42.400
the kind of like market cap quote unquote of of those collections um you know especially

55:42.400 --> 55:51.040
yeah one second if if you look at the sort of like market caps that that those collections can

55:51.040 --> 55:59.200
can support and sort of compare it to um that they kind of current current market caping nouns um

55:59.200 --> 56:05.600
you know I I think it's like it's pretty clear that um the rate of noun production probably

56:05.600 --> 56:12.880
doesn't have that much um impact on the noun price um the price is probably much more a function

56:12.880 --> 56:20.240
of demand than supply uh on royalties and this may be a very naive question but how can artists

56:20.240 --> 56:26.640
who create one-on-one uh create one-on-ones keep their own work right I mean we create and sell one

56:27.360 --> 56:32.480
um that's very different from an addition or collection yeah I mean I I agreed uh and you know

56:32.480 --> 56:41.680
I think you know the the royalty stuff like um to me is it's still like the the correct answers

56:41.680 --> 56:49.120
there are sort of like much less obvious than um then CC zero right where it's like you know

56:49.120 --> 56:56.400
that there's there's already um kind of good infrastructure uh and and um kind of good conventions

56:56.400 --> 57:02.640
around kind of solving solving that problem um royalties I think it's probably gonna take a lot more

57:02.640 --> 57:07.520
kind of experimentation before there's a sort of like consensus model or maybe there won't

57:07.520 --> 57:12.960
ever be a consensus model like maybe every artist will kind of um do do things a little bit

57:12.960 --> 57:19.360
differently um you know I I think it's maybe like to the extent that the thing that artists are

57:19.360 --> 57:26.960
monetizing is is provenance right um I think it's it's probably less about um keeping you know

57:26.960 --> 57:36.240
10% of every piece and more about um monetizing the provenance over the long term right so like

57:36.240 --> 57:41.520
as an example it doesn't really matter for those early ex-copies it's like you know there

57:41.520 --> 57:45.920
there are royalties on them or not because the amount of money ex-copy would make from an

57:45.920 --> 57:52.080
open addition today or you know the amount he made a year ago or whatever you know it's like

57:52.080 --> 57:58.240
orders of magnitude larger than than what the royalty would capture um so I think it really it's

57:58.240 --> 58:06.480
about kind of um monetizing the provenance like over over your career I think yeah the really tricky

58:06.480 --> 58:13.120
thing here that is I guess not yet solved with which might be interesting to think about trying to

58:13.120 --> 58:21.840
solve um at you know outside of implementing royalties is like if if you create a bunch of work

58:21.840 --> 58:29.520
early on um and then kind of stop creating work and then that early work becomes very very valuable

58:29.520 --> 58:33.200
how do you monetize that you know that that's the very specific case where the royalty makes a lot

58:33.200 --> 58:39.040
of sense um but my best guess is that there are like other more kind of like crypto native ways

58:39.040 --> 58:45.280
to solve that problem um that kind of don't come with them some of the baggage that that royalties

58:45.280 --> 58:52.720
comes with um I don't know if the question is coherent but uh do you see dows expand in the future

58:52.720 --> 58:57.760
as a possible framework to manage manage businesses in general what is this prevent what is preventing

58:57.760 --> 59:08.320
this possibility today um yeah I mean it's an interesting question um you know I I think probably

59:08.320 --> 59:13.680
just like crypto itself um there are some low hanging fruit like you know that there are some

59:13.680 --> 59:22.880
kind of obvious use cases um where dows make a lot of sense um and and like where the advantages

59:22.880 --> 59:29.680
of dows versus kind of like traditional corporations um give them a lot of a lot of leverage

59:29.680 --> 59:35.520
and like those are the natural um natural sort of spaces that they're going to occupy for a while

59:35.520 --> 59:42.160
and you know I maybe that that's just like Bitcoin and ether and and these sorts of assets as well

59:42.160 --> 59:46.320
right which is like they have these like very very obvious early use cases but in the long run we

59:46.320 --> 59:53.920
all expect that they will eventually kind of consume everything um and you know I I think the um

59:54.960 --> 00:03.440
you know the the like dap dap as as like a concept is kind of like blockchain as a concept right

00:03.440 --> 00:12.640
like um it it's sort it's a set of ideas um and and like um a sort of a set set of like abstract

00:12.640 --> 00:19.200
rules about how something can work without necessarily being a specific implementation of those

00:19.200 --> 00:25.520
things right like so it seems unlikely to me that you know like um I don't know like the

00:25.520 --> 00:30.320
nouns framework is is the best way to manage a business in general because it's just very

00:30.320 --> 00:35.600
impractical to manage like a business or a startup in a permissionless way where where you're like

00:35.600 --> 00:41.120
inviting someone you into into the business every day and and you know you you can't say whether

00:41.120 --> 00:47.440
they should be in or out like obviously that that's not not the correct uh kind of framework

00:47.440 --> 00:53.200
for for running a startup um but you know that that all of the sort of tools are there to to do this

00:53.200 --> 00:58.320
in a very efficient way and and people will probably eventually figure out how to engineer them in

00:58.320 --> 01:03.360
such a way that you know when when presented with the question of like should I should I start a

01:03.360 --> 01:08.400
uh sort of like on-chain organization you know or or should I go and kind of like set up a Delaware

01:08.400 --> 01:15.600
uh C-Corp like the answer will always be yes let's do it on-chain you know whether the sort of like

01:15.600 --> 01:22.480
decentralized autonomous part of that is is is intact um I'm not sure but certainly on-chain

01:22.480 --> 01:30.480
organizations will um will kind of eat eat everything in the long long term I would expect um yeah

01:30.480 --> 01:34.000
that so that that's the end of the questions there I I'm not sure if anyone is is out there

01:34.000 --> 01:54.960
and still listening um but just let me know if you have more questions or you want to wrap it up

01:54.960 --> 02:02.080
okay six five two nine says I think you're good let's wrap it here all right um okay look thanks

02:02.080 --> 02:07.840
a lot for uh for the questions everyone and uh hope hope you have a great day uh thank thank you

02:07.840 --> 02:37.680
uh 6529 this has been a lot of fun cheers

04:08.320 --> 04:33.040
