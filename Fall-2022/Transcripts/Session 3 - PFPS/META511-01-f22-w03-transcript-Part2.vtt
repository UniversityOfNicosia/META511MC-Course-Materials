00:00.000 --> 00:29.680
Okay, welcome everyone and welcome Greg Salano Gargad. It is our first actual guest lecture.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.640
We had Ellie in the class session, but we have a first guest visiting the course today.

00:34.640 --> 00:43.600
And super excited about this. He is one of the co-founders of Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs today has a fairly

00:43.600 --> 00:50.400
dominant position in the PFP area. And so I think there's going to be a lot of really interesting

00:50.400 --> 00:57.440
things we can discuss starting with some basics and then getting more complicated. But first,

00:57.440 --> 01:04.640
let me welcome Greg to the course. Thank you so much for having me 6529 and thanks to the

01:04.640 --> 01:11.600
University of Nicosia for hosting this course. I think it's super cool. It's a really

01:11.600 --> 01:17.120
exciting way for people to get exposure to a lot of different metaverse thought leaders. I'm

01:17.120 --> 01:22.160
personally excited about a lot of people you have slated to speak later in the semester as it were.

01:22.160 --> 01:32.240
Greg, well let's jump right in and I think for our audience is mixed. I think we have people in

01:32.240 --> 01:40.160
the audience who are absolute NFT gurus and people who are NFT novices. So I'll try and cover

01:40.160 --> 01:46.800
things that will be helpful to both. Let's start at the beginning. How did Yuga Labs, how did the

01:46.800 --> 01:57.760
Bored Ape Yacht Cub, how did it come about? Sure. I think to tell that story, it probably helps to tell

01:57.760 --> 02:05.840
how I was first exposed to crypto. Like a lot of people the first time I heard about Bitcoin in

02:05.840 --> 02:18.800
perhaps 2010, 2011. I wasn't, I was somewhat dismissive at first. I saw it as just this, yeah,

02:18.800 --> 02:25.440
magic internet money was how it was talked about in those early days, right? And it didn't really

02:25.440 --> 02:36.640
capture my attention. But in 2017, I first bought into Ethereum and I immediately called a friend of mine

02:36.640 --> 02:47.120
while I was here now, aka Gordon Connor and had him get in on, it's a crypto with me. And we fell

02:47.120 --> 02:55.760
into this whole world very quickly. We spent a lot of time on crypto Twitter following all these

02:55.760 --> 03:02.720
different personalities that were around. A lot of them, you know, still very active to this day,

03:02.720 --> 03:09.200
Kobe, Lundar, you know, a lot of different folks that that have been kind of mainstays in this

03:09.200 --> 03:19.200
space. And it was so exciting, you know, it really felt like crypto engaged our attention like almost

03:19.200 --> 03:28.320
nothing else. Why me and I in particular would spend a lot of our time hanging out in digital spaces,

03:28.320 --> 03:34.240
playing World of Warcraft or other different MMORPGs, massive multiplayer online role playing games

03:34.240 --> 03:44.320
together and weirdly our session with crypto ran very much in parallel with it. It was a parallel

03:44.320 --> 03:54.640
passion. And in those days, I was exposed to crypto kitties. And it was fascinating. I didn't

03:54.640 --> 04:04.080
actually buy a cryptocurrency at the time in 2017-2018 that area while we did. But I fell into NFTs

04:04.080 --> 04:13.440
later more deeply in 2021. There were a slew of different projects that all of a sudden felt like

04:13.440 --> 04:19.920
they were using the blockchain to as more of a medium than anything else. It wasn't, you know,

04:19.920 --> 04:29.040
crypto kitties was at its core of a game and an experience. But then when you had hash mass,

04:29.040 --> 04:34.960
which was kind of this arc project that was using Ethereum as a medium and you had people

04:35.680 --> 04:42.880
selling an NFT for an extraordinary camera price at Christie's, you really started to feel like

04:42.880 --> 04:51.120
this is something where this is a new medium opening up in the same way that anything, you know,

04:51.120 --> 04:58.400
podcasts opened up to the world 10 years before. And if you could be early to that and if you could

04:58.400 --> 05:04.880
be one of the first people to join in and tell stories on a platform and understand how communities

05:04.880 --> 05:12.480
would form around it and engage with things and what would succeed, what would be viral, it would be fun.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.600
There's a lot of power to that because my background was in creative writing. I was a book editor

05:17.600 --> 05:24.480
for 10 years. I was a poet. And so why didn't I really just were off to the races trying to

05:24.480 --> 05:30.800
understand what kind of NFT project we could create? We've looped in our other two founders

05:30.800 --> 05:38.320
tomato and sass aka primanzishan for the engineering part of things. And we spent some months

05:40.400 --> 05:46.800
playing around with all kinds of ideas. But in the end, what we settled on was we wanted to make a

05:47.840 --> 05:53.840
an NFT collection, a similar in spirit to CryptoPunks, Matt and John's CryptoPunks that obviously

05:53.840 --> 06:02.880
have 10,000 NFTs, unique PFCs. But we wanted there to be some inherent utility to the token.

06:02.880 --> 06:08.800
We wanted it to be something that you could, you know, the prime thing that we were interested in

06:08.800 --> 06:16.080
from the beginning was NFTs as something that, you know, having a great use space for two things.

06:16.080 --> 06:22.640
Authenticity and scarcity. And earlier on with CryptoKitties, those two things kind of got a little

06:22.640 --> 06:29.680
out of whack with the breeding mechanics. There was too much supply, felt dilutive. But with the wave

06:29.680 --> 06:37.440
of projects coming prominence and the kind of rediscovery or celebration of CryptoPunks that

06:37.440 --> 06:44.480
was happening in 2021, it was really about the idea of knowing that you had this immutable NFT

06:44.480 --> 06:51.520
on the blockchain, and there was only X number of them, the prominence of that. And so we came up with

06:51.520 --> 06:55.760
the idea of Bored Ape Yacht Club. And the inherent utility of the token was going to be that if you

06:55.760 --> 07:02.480
owned a BAYC, that you were going to be part of a club. And what that club met at the beginning

07:03.760 --> 07:09.120
was just that you were among like-minded people, hopefully, but also that you got access to a

07:09.120 --> 07:16.960
digital pixel board, a little space on our website, cryptographically verified that you could use

07:16.960 --> 07:24.800
your token to get access to the, quote, bathroom and, you know, graffiti on the wall. And if you

07:24.800 --> 07:29.840
own a BAYC, you could put a pixel down every 15 minutes. And so the bathroom would be kind of

07:29.840 --> 07:39.680
this palmsest of people writing to this wall in collaboration with one another. And that was

07:39.680 --> 07:48.080
the initial thing. And as far as the spirit of what Bordeic meant to us early on, we really saw

07:48.960 --> 07:56.560
a lot of the early influencers and people in the space that we followed for years as Bordeics.

07:56.560 --> 08:02.080
You know, an ape is an affectionate term in crypto and in trading circles for people who dive

08:02.080 --> 08:08.240
first into an asset or kind of throw caution to the wind. There's a reason why some of the most

08:08.240 --> 08:12.960
valuable apes in the crypto punk, some, why some of the most valuable NFTs in the crypto punk

08:12.960 --> 08:17.520
collection are apes. And so we thought it'd be really cool to make an entire collection, an

08:17.520 --> 08:22.880
entire NFT project that was just about the apes. But also that it didn't necessarily take itself

08:22.880 --> 08:29.920
too seriously. There are people on crypto Twitter that you can cryptographically verify or

08:29.920 --> 08:38.640
worth incredible sums of money. Yet they are spending their days shit-posting, you know, making jokes,

08:38.640 --> 08:43.920
looking for people to play League of Legends with. They were in every way to us like Bordeics. And

08:43.920 --> 08:51.200
so we started to imagine like what a this kind of fanciful, irreverent, strange world of the Bordeic

08:51.200 --> 08:56.640
yacht club might look like. And we said it in our hometown of Miami. We said it in the Everglades.

08:56.640 --> 09:03.680
And yeah, the rest is history. So let's talk about that. I remember the early days when you

09:03.680 --> 09:10.640
launched. The the start didn't look shockingly promising. Like the mint didn't mint out right

09:10.640 --> 09:18.320
away. It took several days. And so it's now have generated maximum coping from every one of us who

09:18.320 --> 09:23.600
didn't go and mint a lot of Bordeics during that period. I think I bought one the week afterwards

09:23.600 --> 09:30.080
or something. And okay, it was another PFP project that didn't mint out for several days.

09:30.080 --> 09:34.880
And there was the Boughton board as you say. And when saying, oh, I wonder who's going to draw

09:34.880 --> 09:44.800
genitals on the Boughton board, right? But from there to where we are today is kind of a shocking

09:44.800 --> 09:55.200
difference, right? So let me put it differently. If you saw the project on day 10,

09:57.200 --> 10:04.000
you could imagine a lot of projects like that on day 10, most of which have not had the success

10:04.000 --> 10:12.800
or even a fractional success that the project is at. What do you attribute to the fact that

10:12.800 --> 10:20.400
it started, you know, normally fun, silly, but didn't seem too serious. And suddenly it just

10:20.400 --> 10:26.160
built up this life of its own and turned into what it turned into. What in your mind was that

10:26.160 --> 10:34.720
magic, the secret sauce, the magic formula? What did it? Yeah, I attributed to a few things.

10:34.720 --> 10:43.920
Number one, we tried to set up the incentive structure in a little bit different way

10:44.560 --> 10:49.360
than a lot of things that had come out at the same time or just before the UIC.

10:50.400 --> 10:55.760
So you had a series of different projects that were following the formula where each mint

10:55.760 --> 11:00.640
would cost, you know, first X amount of been saved, thousand, cost a certain price.

11:00.640 --> 11:06.320
And then the next thousand more and then the next thousand more until in the end the collection

11:06.320 --> 11:14.080
is sold out. But that leaves you with holders that all have different entry prices into this.

11:14.080 --> 11:20.000
And then it kind of felt inherently disuniting. It wasn't exactly welcoming when you would

11:20.000 --> 11:26.640
join a discord and know that the guy next to you paid on the same website from the same

11:26.640 --> 11:31.680
mentor for the primary sale, the different costs. It felt like something that would help sell

11:31.680 --> 11:37.600
out a project, but not necessarily be healthy to the sustainability of the project.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.480
Obviously, crypto punks were a free claim and, you know, completely different.

11:43.200 --> 11:48.800
But at the time when we were minting in 2021, most projects in the space were following

11:48.800 --> 11:53.680
this other model. So that was one of the things we did. We said every eight should cost 0.08,

11:53.680 --> 12:01.520
218 bucks or something like that is what it was at the time. And we tried very hard to

12:02.640 --> 12:10.880
push a sense of welcoming into our discord. Anytime somebody would join,

12:11.840 --> 12:16.240
we wanted there to be a stream of all caps welcome there. We wanted

12:17.680 --> 12:22.800
the founders to be available for any issues people are having. If people meet it to DM us and

12:22.800 --> 12:29.840
ask us questions, we were around. And I think there was a bit of magic in that

12:31.360 --> 12:41.360
NBA top shot had just exposed a lot of new people to entities. And we found around the time

12:41.360 --> 12:46.720
of the BOIC mint. A lot of those people, we were their first kind of Ethereum entity.

12:46.720 --> 12:53.680
And there was a lot of excitement to that. There was a lot of people, you know, we had built

12:53.680 --> 13:01.280
this project seemingly hoping for a lot of crypto native people to be exposed. When in fact,

13:01.920 --> 13:06.480
what ended up happening was a lot of people who'd kind of put a toe into this base. Yes,

13:06.480 --> 13:12.960
they bought something off coin base before or they had experimented with NBA top shots or

13:12.960 --> 13:19.920
otherwise. But we were the first thing to kind of bring them into setting up a Metamask wallet

13:19.920 --> 13:28.400
and getting involved in a community. And capturing that kind of organic energy from the start

13:28.400 --> 13:34.800
and having those people so excited and finding each other. And as a reminder too, we were in

13:34.800 --> 13:43.440
COVID. So just finding friends and engagement and having a good time on Discord is a really

13:43.440 --> 13:52.720
powerful thing just from the start. That helped a lot. And I think also we, frankly as the founders,

13:53.760 --> 14:01.920
we sold out the collection and then we worked 14 hours a day ever since to not take that moment

14:01.920 --> 14:07.760
for granted and try and create new experiences in any way that we could. And I think

14:09.200 --> 14:16.800
you know, when we were doing token gated merch, say a month later and boxing up T-shirts and hats

14:16.800 --> 14:23.360
that we sold and we were boxing up in my mom's backyard. Yes, there had been token gated

14:23.360 --> 14:32.000
merch before. Obviously the most famous of which would be unisocks of, you know, if you own

14:32.000 --> 14:40.160
the token, you could redeem it for actual socks. But it wasn't necessarily a community or felt

14:40.160 --> 14:45.440
like something that could be its own lifestyle brand. And the other aspect I think that was really

14:45.440 --> 14:53.840
powerful the whole way through is we gave all of our holders commercial rights to their aid. And

14:53.840 --> 14:59.920
that sense of having a stake in the project being part of the community and having it tied to your

15:00.640 --> 15:09.680
online identity that was really powerful and led to a lot of projects and ingenuity and creativity

15:09.680 --> 15:17.440
in a bottoms up way throughout the space where we had Jenkins de Valet very early on getting signed

15:17.440 --> 15:26.160
to CAA and developing an entire, his own entire project, you know, really starting with his

15:26.160 --> 15:30.240
eighth and the story that he was telling and telling other, you know, community member stories.

15:30.800 --> 15:37.920
And we've now seen everything from animated TV shows that are in development to people

15:37.920 --> 15:44.640
watching clothing brands, sometimes very simple streetwear, other times as incredible as like,

15:44.640 --> 15:51.120
you know, $500, like cashmere, exquisite cashmere cardigans being sold at like Fred Segal.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.400
And that's been really special. Yeah, that was a bit long-winded, but I think that covers

16:00.000 --> 16:04.240
broadly speaking a lot of what I think I attribute our success to.

16:04.240 --> 16:11.200
No, it sounds reasonable and I will say I think, you know, there was also a feeling,

16:12.000 --> 16:16.240
maybe I'm reading this from the outside, but like there were people who

16:18.000 --> 16:23.200
viewed themselves as the upstart rebels relative to the punks in some capacity, right? Like it was

16:23.200 --> 16:32.640
the New York cohort, more fun, more irreverent, something in that direction. But I want to build on

16:32.640 --> 16:40.400
this commercial rights issue because that had had a lot of follow-on effects in the space.

16:40.400 --> 16:45.120
I think massive follow-on effects. I mean, if I think of the thing that probably changed the

16:45.120 --> 16:55.120
space the most, it's this. And let's dig into it a little bit. How is that going now, right?

16:55.120 --> 17:01.600
And then what I mean by this is the following. In the early days, you absolutely saw the initial

17:01.600 --> 17:09.040
activity, right? Someone would do a DJ set and use their or dates or a coffee brand or a microgroup.

17:10.000 --> 17:16.480
And certain people signed, as you said, to agencies. There was the group that was the music group

17:16.480 --> 17:24.400
that was signed. First question, how is that going today a year and a half later? Are these

17:24.400 --> 17:32.160
things that still developing? Do you have any metrics to track them? Is there, are people sticking to

17:32.160 --> 17:37.920
it? Because some of the kind of the blow in the bear case on community commercial rights is

17:37.920 --> 17:45.120
the blue case is obvious. You'll get 10,000 people working to promote the rent. The bear case is

17:45.920 --> 17:50.800
probably most of those people don't actually have the capacity or capability to build

17:50.800 --> 17:56.320
a viable business because building businesses is hard. In any case, not just in this case.

17:57.360 --> 18:05.520
How do you think about it? How do you manage it? How do you track it? What does success look like?

18:05.520 --> 18:13.200
How do you think about the software? Yeah, I think to start with the idea behind it,

18:13.200 --> 18:23.520
why it made sense to us was if this token of this BAYC cryptographically verified on the blockchain

18:24.320 --> 18:30.880
by owning one, we wanted it to be your digital identity in any way you solve it,

18:30.880 --> 18:36.720
that it would make sense to us to make sure that you had unlimited commercial rights to that thing

18:36.720 --> 18:47.040
so that if you wanted to appear as your Bordeic in sandbox or in decentralized or in other side

18:47.040 --> 18:51.520
or in any other kind of metaverse space, you could do that. You wouldn't have to ask permission.

18:52.640 --> 18:58.240
The optionality of that whole experience is the most important part of it to me.

18:58.240 --> 19:06.000
Yes, there are people who, there have been people that have expanded a tremendous amount of

19:06.000 --> 19:09.360
effort or are extremely talented and are building incredible things with their BAYCs.

19:10.080 --> 19:15.840
There's the Borden Hungry fast food restaurant, there's Dr. von Bees,

19:15.840 --> 19:20.560
Snoop Dogg's alter ego BAYC that appears with them seemingly on stage all the time these days.

19:20.560 --> 19:30.320
There's casual sweaters being sold at some of the most revered shops in the world,

19:30.320 --> 19:35.840
you know, shops in the world like Fred Siegel and there's different animated shows,

19:35.840 --> 19:42.240
some that are still in development and some more web-3 native versions that are going to be coming

19:42.240 --> 19:51.840
out that we're aware of. How do we measure it? How do we track it? I don't know the best answer

19:51.840 --> 19:57.520
to that. The whole idea is that it's a permissionless system and that we don't necessarily need to.

19:58.800 --> 20:04.320
If these things are able to spread up and do spread up without us, then it's doing its job.

20:05.440 --> 20:10.480
And as long as people don't feel like there are blockers towards their

20:10.480 --> 20:17.520
creativity and that's what's most important from our perspective. I don't know if that answers

20:17.520 --> 20:26.000
your question. No, I think that's clear. I'll say it back in my words, if someone's going to make

20:26.000 --> 20:31.040
their identity, this PFP their identity, well, they should be able to do whatever they want with it,

20:31.040 --> 20:37.920
right? They don't have to go ask someone permission and then there's a normal 80, 20, or 90, 10,

20:37.920 --> 20:44.080
or 95, 5 outcome was a few people will do it off a lot of things and most people won't do very much

20:44.080 --> 20:51.600
but even if they don't do very much, it's valuable. The idea is valuable even if you don't actually

20:52.560 --> 20:58.160
start a merchandise shop or a fast food restaurant a day by your board. Is that a fair assessment?

20:58.720 --> 21:06.640
That's a great summary. Yeah. Okay. In that world, let's build on that. What do you see

21:06.640 --> 21:16.560
the role of the company and the role of the network in what comes over one year, three years, ten years?

21:17.360 --> 21:25.200
What do you do now? Because you know, you're now getting into much more verified territory.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.320
Going from one million to ten million, one thing and ten million to a hundred million is another

21:30.320 --> 21:36.720
thing. Now whether you look at the market cap of all your tokens or the equity value of the firm,

21:36.720 --> 21:42.800
generally, we're talking billions. So now this is now moving forward at that level.

21:42.800 --> 21:47.920
There's a different game than a third level. Who does what? How do they do it? How do you think about it?

21:47.920 --> 21:54.800
What are the goals? How do I think about this stuff? Yeah. So I think there's a couple different

21:54.800 --> 22:02.400
questions that I hear there. Number one, yes, you guys experienced exponential growth over the past

22:02.400 --> 22:12.000
year and a half. In January of this year, we were 11 people today. We're 85 and we'll almost certainly

22:12.000 --> 22:20.320
be over a hundred before the end of the year. And part of that is having several different teams,

22:20.320 --> 22:27.120
but the ones that are most built out on the BAYC team and the other side team, that are constantly

22:28.400 --> 22:36.000
working on projects of vastly different scale. Some things might be as small as a merch shop

22:36.000 --> 22:43.920
for B O I C. And then there might be projects that have literally, you know, a year plus long

22:43.920 --> 22:51.120
time span until lunch. And as we approach what we want to do, though, as we think of BAYC say,

22:51.920 --> 22:59.680
what is a Web 3 lifestyle brand? Look like a Web 3 club. Look like there's things we've talked

22:59.680 --> 23:07.760
about like having a in real life clubhouse here in Miami where people can get together in the

23:07.760 --> 23:14.640
vein, perhaps, of something like so house or ZZ's or some of these amazing membership clubs that

23:14.640 --> 23:22.320
exist. That's one thing. And there's a lot of different aspects of what we're building with B O I

23:22.320 --> 23:27.360
C. But I'd say the most consistent question in this time and your question about commercial rights

23:27.360 --> 23:35.840
and what users do is how do we do things in a way that's a value add and doesn't say in

23:35.840 --> 23:45.040
pin John or step on anyone's toes. Right now, there's several different animated series that I

23:45.040 --> 23:51.200
know of where people are either we're using at least one word as a character in a show or something

23:51.200 --> 24:04.160
like that. That's awesome. If we were to come out and do, you know, our own BAYC show and

24:04.160 --> 24:10.320
not incorporate the community then that hurts those people who are going out and doing, you know,

24:10.320 --> 24:16.880
trying to tell their stories. So how can we structure our business, what we're doing as a company

24:17.520 --> 24:27.120
in a way where we're creating sandboxes for other people to build together and enjoy the

24:27.120 --> 24:34.800
commercial rights and connect with one another and all those sorts of things rather than doing things

24:34.800 --> 24:42.960
that are redundant or duplicative or taking over things that really should be more on the community

24:42.960 --> 24:51.920
level than otherwise. Okay, that makes sense. You mentioned twice lifestyle company, right?

24:51.920 --> 25:03.520
What does that mean to you? Early on, we thought of this idea of like what would a Web 3

25:04.320 --> 25:15.200
Supreme look like. There's what's it's been very interesting over the past year and a half

25:15.200 --> 25:21.520
as NFTs have gone more and more into the mainstream how different legacy companies or

25:21.520 --> 25:33.760
industries have have taken or not to Web 3. There's a lot of game companies that are very actively

25:34.640 --> 25:39.760
tripling in companies that are very actively building, exploring, enjoying, you know, the fruits

25:39.760 --> 25:48.400
of a Web 3 division. However, there's a lot of gamers who are more reticent towards games,

25:48.400 --> 25:55.360
towards blockchain gaming. There's a number of different reasons and thoughts on that we can get

25:55.360 --> 26:05.360
into that later. On the other hand, you have companies like LVMH and the caring group behind

26:05.360 --> 26:12.800
Gucci and Valenciaga and so many different major brands who seem to very much be leaning into

26:12.800 --> 26:22.640
Web 3. They're thinking about, hey, here's this protocol layer tool, this tech that we can use

26:22.640 --> 26:28.880
that is all about digital scarcity and authenticity. And they have these companies that that's

26:28.880 --> 26:35.680
the red and butter is creating a brand and maintaining a strict level of scarcity and authenticity.

26:35.680 --> 26:43.840
And I think for that reason, we're going to see an explosion of more and more interest from that

26:43.840 --> 26:49.440
that whole sector. And that was something that we thought about very early on with BAUIC,

26:49.440 --> 26:56.640
where I'm like crypto punks where the punks themselves are kind of the low. There was no crypto

26:56.640 --> 27:01.520
punks logo per se. There is that kind of beautiful hot pink that they picked for the website,

27:01.520 --> 27:08.480
but it wasn't really like a Nike swoosh or something like that. Whereas for BAYC,

27:08.480 --> 27:13.600
we were very cognizant of, hey, we want there to be a logo here, we want there to be a story,

27:13.600 --> 27:22.640
we want there to be more for people to launch off of and generate stories from and content from

27:25.840 --> 27:30.160
in a way where constraints and storytelling can be generative and not that we're like saying

27:30.160 --> 27:36.560
strict canon and that's all there is to the story. So navigating that those lines was always

27:36.560 --> 27:44.320
really important to us. And so, yeah, we wanted the BAYC school to be our Nike swoosh and what

27:44.320 --> 27:52.640
does that mean in a Web 3 space? I think there's a lot of potential there. I mean, just seeing that

27:52.640 --> 27:59.920
Azuki is releasing there a new physical token standard. That's just awesome. I think we're going to see

27:59.920 --> 28:06.800
a lot more experiments in this space. I think it's very natural for NFT company to be

28:08.000 --> 28:16.560
diving and thinking of itself as a lifestyle brand. So, here's a question that I go back and

28:16.560 --> 28:23.520
I think I thought about it a reasonable note. You have 30,000 PFP token holders, right? Let's leave

28:23.520 --> 28:28.960
the punks out for a second. All right. So, the board apes and the mutant apes. And there's the code

28:28.960 --> 28:32.480
is that I think are part of the game and are not exactly PFPs. We'll discover that, but that

28:32.480 --> 28:41.200
even if we put those in, it's another 10,000. So, 40,000. Rolex, which is thought of as a fairly

28:41.200 --> 28:48.000
exclusive brand, sells a million Rolexes a year. Nike, much of the swoosh, sells 800 million shoes,

28:48.000 --> 28:55.120
pairs of shoes a year. So, Nike is of course a global brand and hundreds of millions of people

28:55.920 --> 29:03.600
are part of that brand. Even Rolex, it's almost a code word for, I mean, not

29:03.600 --> 29:10.800
update luxury, but luxury exclusive. Millions, tens of millions of people own a Rolex or part of the

29:10.800 --> 29:21.120
Rolex community. Your community is 40,000 people, right? And that's closer to a superhyper elite

29:21.760 --> 29:31.120
sub-brand of old VH or something like a Soho House, you know, 30 to 40,000 people is a very, very

29:31.120 --> 29:43.920
elite brand. But I would say the aesthetic of, or it is more fun, less, this is a Swiss watch

29:43.920 --> 29:49.360
that you're going to hand out, hand down to 11 generations and build a whole wing of your house

29:49.360 --> 29:53.520
to put it in, right? I give it, neither one's right wrong. It's just the aesthetic that comes out.

29:53.520 --> 30:01.520
And so, if these are somehow comparable, I don't know the numbers off hand for supreme, but I

30:01.520 --> 30:06.240
think supreme sells a reasonable amount of goods or a reasonable amount of people on an ongoing

30:06.240 --> 30:15.520
basis. How does this play out? Does the community need to grow? Do you become hyper elite? Is it

30:15.520 --> 30:21.840
going to be, you know, Soho House is a lifestyle brand and Nike is a lifestyle brand, but Soho House

30:21.840 --> 30:27.440
is a lifestyle brand that you need thousands of dollars to get into. And Nike is a lifestyle brand,

30:27.440 --> 30:34.880
you need like, I don't know, 40 bucks to get into. How does this play out? Yeah, obviously it's a

30:34.880 --> 30:42.240
question that a lot of people have been asking ever since this new wave of NFT collections have

30:42.240 --> 30:47.200
come out and attained valuations that are massive. And on par with some of these companies that

30:47.200 --> 30:54.160
are, we're far exceeding some of these companies that seem to have way more users. I will say,

30:54.160 --> 31:04.000
I think there's a difference between owning BAYC for me being part of a club, let's say. And other

31:04.000 --> 31:16.000
ways to experience things and have exposure to BAYC as a brand. And I think as we onboard,

31:16.000 --> 31:22.640
more and more people into Web 3, there is going to be much more opportunities for things like

31:22.640 --> 31:31.360
that to happen in a way that are not dilutive necessarily to the BAYC club members, you know,

31:31.360 --> 31:38.720
the people who own the 10,000 BAYC, 20,000 mutants, but still provide, say, a tiering of access

31:38.720 --> 31:47.040
to people to buy a BAYC t-shirt. One of our most successful merch shops all time was when we

31:47.040 --> 31:55.760
did a drop with a collab with the hundreds. And there was a public sale colorway where anyone can

31:55.760 --> 32:02.720
buy this logo mashup of the BAYC and 100s logo on the hundreds website. And I think we'll see

32:02.720 --> 32:09.760
a lot more of that. We'll see a lot more of co-labs and ways for people to participate in the space,

32:09.760 --> 32:17.920
while still maintaining the exclusivity of the club as it stands today. That feels that's very

32:17.920 --> 32:29.360
important to us. I think it's an unfortunate aspect of some early NFT projects where breeding

32:29.360 --> 32:37.360
mechanics got totally out of hand and felt more akin to a free-to-play model where

32:38.800 --> 32:45.440
you're constantly having to devalue the original thing in order to gain a customer acquisition.

32:45.440 --> 32:52.000
I think there is a much more thoughtful and sustainable model attainable where you treat it,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.400
like I said, more like a brand and you're not constantly expanding the club or anything like that.

32:56.400 --> 33:03.280
Well, it's interesting you mentioned free-to-play because this has now gotten

33:04.240 --> 33:15.120
hot again with Gabriel Layden's Digi Di-Gruz, and it's getting a lot of attention.

33:16.000 --> 33:22.480
It's not 100% clear to me how that's different than other things that happen in that

33:22.480 --> 33:29.040
NFT space because I mean, the air drop might be free, but I went and bought a Digi Di-Gruz

33:29.040 --> 33:33.280
by everything. Oh, my one of everything just to see how I feel when I heard it.

33:33.920 --> 33:39.280
And it certainly wasn't free when I bought it. I think I paid 50 needs, so I mean, it wasn't,

33:39.920 --> 33:44.320
I doubt I'll be playing whatever game's going to be there, but it certainly wasn't free for me to

33:44.320 --> 33:50.800
play it. I had to buy it on the secondary market in OpenSea. What does free-to-play even mean in

33:50.800 --> 33:58.640
the context of NFTs? I mean, there's a robust secondary market in these characters and it's not

33:58.640 --> 34:06.160
at all free and how do we think about that? Yeah, I think about free-to-play more in a sense of,

34:09.040 --> 34:13.920
you know, there's been a lot of innovations in gaming over the past 20 years that the industry

34:13.920 --> 34:20.640
has changed all the time. I've never worked in gaming, but I've written books on video games

34:20.640 --> 34:28.800
and you know, been an avid gamer my whole life. And what I think about is the different ways

34:28.800 --> 34:35.280
where game companies have tried to structure incentives or subscription models to

34:35.280 --> 34:44.720
acquire new users. And so you have something I think a lot about, for example, as it pertains to, and a

34:44.720 --> 34:50.960
tease, and the future of watching gaming is Dota AllStars. Dota All-Stars was a MOBA, so a genre of

34:50.960 --> 34:56.720
video game that now, you know, we look at League of Legends and it's one of the most popular engaging

34:56.720 --> 35:01.280
video games in the world. And I think I'll cryptate Twitter like the most popular video game in the world,

35:01.280 --> 35:11.360
probably. But it really started out as this Warcraft 3 mod, this custom game mode,

35:12.560 --> 35:20.880
called Dota All-Stars, where a user with a pseudonym, IceRog, I believe it was, and I think there

35:20.880 --> 35:31.600
were some other people involved too, created a game using a open-source map maker of sorts,

35:31.600 --> 35:39.200
where Warcraft 3 said, hey, if you can use our graphics, our characters, the rigs, and the map

35:39.200 --> 35:47.200
mode, and make a game and enjoy yourselves. Have fun. Yet Warcraft 3 had no subscription model.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.360
They weren't making money, they were making 10 bucks a month like they do on Warcraft or something

35:51.360 --> 36:02.560
like that, or 15. And IceRog had seemingly no in-platform way to monetize this either. And so you

36:02.560 --> 36:11.440
had this setup where you had arguably one of the most popular games in the world, and nobody was

36:11.440 --> 36:19.280
really making money directly off of it, until somebody took the learnings of this genre,

36:19.280 --> 36:26.320
adapt it, and classed them up, professionalized them, and released League of Legends, which,

36:26.320 --> 36:32.160
you know, and the rest of their history. And now you have a game that makes a couple billion

36:32.160 --> 36:37.360
dollars a year, I think, selling skin, selling cosmetics that would have on a database.

36:37.360 --> 36:46.080
So one, and that's the free-to-play model. You know, League of Legends now, they make incredible

36:46.080 --> 36:51.600
amounts of money on skins, so does Fortnite, Fortnite makes double triple the amount that they do,

36:51.600 --> 36:59.840
I think. And obviously, these are just cosmetic characters, they're fun, they're your digital avatar

36:59.840 --> 37:07.040
in the game. You can send the friends, I think, sometimes, but oftentimes not. But you don't

37:07.040 --> 37:16.240
know, maybe truly own these things. And then you also have a whole lot of, quote, free-to-play

37:16.240 --> 37:23.760
or games that exist on the app store. People spend over a hundred billion dollars a year on the

37:23.760 --> 37:32.800
app store, buying digital assets for games. And the way that those games work is you have to keep

37:32.800 --> 37:41.680
buying a certain item. You'll finally show up to buy it. But seemingly, the next season,

37:41.680 --> 37:45.920
there's something that's even better, and then you're showing up again and again. And with the

37:45.920 --> 37:53.120
statistics show us about those games, it's about 8% of the people playing them are accounting for

37:53.120 --> 37:57.520
like 90 something percent of the revenue of these games. It's a very like whale-driven market.

37:57.520 --> 38:04.320
And so, when I think about the opportunity for what Gabriel's calling

38:05.440 --> 38:10.800
played at own or just in general watching gaming, it's the idea of how do we create

38:10.800 --> 38:21.600
an incentive structure where the next time somebody is creating a game on top of a platform

38:21.600 --> 38:28.960
the way Dota AllStars is made on top of Warcraft III, that the content creator doesn't need to go

38:28.960 --> 38:36.160
off and where the person doing this doesn't have to go off and I create a YouTube channel

38:36.160 --> 38:42.400
or a Patreon or something else in order to monetize the development. That the idea that these

38:42.400 --> 38:49.280
things are entities at their core means that the ownership and the treatability and the access

38:49.280 --> 38:56.560
and a lot more crypto-native things here will make the value grow much smoother and so that you don't

38:56.560 --> 39:04.400
have another company popping up and sucking out all of that. And I agree, I don't know that like

39:06.640 --> 39:15.040
that the whole play to own thing is a free to own thing is a bit of a meme here and that there's

39:15.040 --> 39:19.520
been a lot of things that have functioned in this way but what I'm just excited about is the idea

39:19.520 --> 39:32.240
of games where there's the inherent openness and interoperability of NFTs and what that opens up

39:32.240 --> 39:42.080
for gaming across different platforms where no longer if there's that authenticity and scarcity

39:42.080 --> 39:48.480
inherent NFTs and it's in a game then it feels like the traditional free to play some cost systems

39:48.480 --> 39:53.920
where you're constantly developing the previous thing maybe don't need to happen if there is

39:54.720 --> 40:00.640
a value of rule that can happen as opposed on like you say a platform royalty level or something

40:00.640 --> 40:08.160
like that. Okay well you mentioned royalties it was on my to-do list so let's jump into it.

40:08.160 --> 40:14.320
There has now I'm going to do a little background for the audience. I think through the first

40:14.320 --> 40:24.240
couple of years of NFTs one of the things that was been promoted as a positive feature particularly

40:24.240 --> 40:31.440
for artists is that they would earn secondary royalties and by what this means is royalties

40:32.000 --> 40:37.920
on someone selling their NFTs to someone else. So a primary sale is when it sold by the

40:37.920 --> 40:43.040
artist or the project creator to the user and the secondary sale is when that user sells it further

40:43.040 --> 40:53.760
out and this was promoted both as a boon to artists who might in the beginning be less well-known

40:53.760 --> 40:58.080
and might sell their work inexpensively but then they become successful and somehow they share

40:58.080 --> 41:05.520
in the success and it has been very effective for the large and successful projects. I mean the

41:05.520 --> 41:12.320
initial airdrop did not fund you go labs very much money but because the collection became

41:12.320 --> 41:18.000
very popular and traded a lot it generated a very large income stream of royalties and this

41:18.000 --> 41:24.160
was let's say state of the world until three to six months ago three to six months ago a lot of

41:24.160 --> 41:32.640
folks from in my view the fungible claim world looked at royalties and said oh my this is transaction

41:32.640 --> 41:37.040
tax in a really high one it's two and a half percent or five percent or ten percent

41:38.000 --> 41:49.760
and this is not so we couldn't imagine like Solana or sushi or B&B taking five or ten percent

41:49.760 --> 41:57.920
of your B&B every time you sell it. This is crazy and we're in a permissionless blockchain of course

41:57.920 --> 42:06.320
the blockchain is going to route around these taxes because there's always a way technically to

42:06.320 --> 42:15.120
run it around them and it started a process of one exchange uh said well I'm not going to

42:16.000 --> 42:21.680
auto royalties or make them optional and you know I remember saying at the time I mean that's

42:21.680 --> 42:25.360
clearly not a sustainable business model for them because if it works all the changes you're

42:25.360 --> 42:34.080
going to do it um and now there's this very active debate where let's say one team

42:35.600 --> 42:43.840
believes that the NFT project creators and artists are being hopelessly naive in expecting that

42:43.840 --> 42:50.320
this type of royalty amounts could remain attached to the surface and the other side

42:50.320 --> 43:00.720
says well this is not the deal we signed up for I'm a photographer I sold you this NFT with these

43:00.720 --> 43:05.440
terms and you're just violating them and I mean some of the more extreme reactions and I'm okay

43:05.440 --> 43:10.000
you can sell it for no royalties but then change the metadata on a contract where the metadata

43:10.000 --> 43:14.240
is not frozen and then you would have that if they were this was we had a deal this was a contract

43:14.240 --> 43:20.880
we had a deal and and then kind of the third point of view which at least I think more intellectually

43:20.880 --> 43:25.440
honest than the first point of view as well other artists will come out compete to artists who

43:25.440 --> 43:30.080
want royalties by offering their work without royalties to me I think that's more intellectually

43:30.080 --> 43:34.400
honest than people who want to change the rules of the game and then you know there's other

43:34.400 --> 43:39.280
people sometimes like well we should keep it for artists but you know big projects like you

43:39.280 --> 43:44.560
know they've made a lot of money they don't need them they'll sell t-shirts or access to the club

43:44.560 --> 43:51.920
or other drops and on the fifth hand then I'm going to stop or if you'll say well you're just

43:51.920 --> 43:57.360
going to incent project creators to dilute your initial NFTs because if they're not can't make any

43:57.360 --> 44:02.080
money off the secondary market they'll just do more drops which might be fine for them but might

44:02.080 --> 44:10.160
not be so great for you so be careful what you wish for and we're in this I think calm before

44:10.160 --> 44:17.280
the storm to be honest state right what's your view on this A how do you see it playing out B

44:18.000 --> 44:27.200
does it is it different for a pfp community for an artist and I guess where do you think we'll

44:27.200 --> 44:34.240
settle out in one two five years on the stop so I'll start with the caveat that I'm not so much

44:34.240 --> 44:43.280
of a futurist as has yourself in in thinking about the long term arc of you know playing out how

44:43.280 --> 44:49.520
some of these things might resolve over the course of say five years I will say from the very

44:49.520 --> 44:59.440
beginning it's been interesting how of all the different people coming into this space from

44:59.440 --> 45:08.640
different industries let's say some of the most engaged very early on people who came from

45:08.640 --> 45:17.840
the music industry which is an industry where people feel where creators have gotten often feel

45:17.840 --> 45:29.120
like the creators have gotten to rock you my partner Gio series partner here at Yuga that's

45:29.120 --> 45:37.040
certainly what interested him about the NFT space is here it is a world where creators can have

45:37.600 --> 45:47.120
a smart contract on day one on their terms and not wait until you know whereas a lot of musicians

45:47.120 --> 45:51.280
they don't they don't have a great contract day one they work their way up to it with help

45:51.280 --> 46:00.400
the managers and agents and all this stuff over time and so that there's that power to the idea

46:00.400 --> 46:10.320
of creator royalties and how easy they were for a while there to set up across the space was

46:10.320 --> 46:22.720
really powerful so that said we've always known that creator royalties were something that you could

46:22.720 --> 46:30.480
get around you know the way it functions or those who don't know obviously is it's essentially a

46:30.480 --> 46:37.280
fee that's getting paid to you by the platform not inherent to the smart contract itself so like

46:37.280 --> 46:46.160
as if eBay or stock X decided to send a little bit of money to Nike every time somebody bought

46:46.160 --> 46:54.240
a pair of air Jordans on on their platform and for a long time it's been extremely useful I think

46:54.240 --> 47:02.240
in directing liquidity and value and creators promoting marketplaces as opposed to others

47:02.240 --> 47:13.600
I think the way that this is playing out currently is very interesting I think in part it is a

47:13.600 --> 47:23.280
reaction to marketplace fees being too high I think in part you know a lot of the trading that's

47:23.280 --> 47:28.960
happened in the past years happened by people that knew perfectly well they could have gotten

47:28.960 --> 47:38.560
around the royalties should they have chosen to it's things like NFT trader have been around since

47:39.920 --> 47:47.600
basically since since foray minted as far as I know and yet we've seen a lot of people

47:49.280 --> 47:52.880
decide that they want to pay the royalty either the buyers want to make sure that that's

47:52.880 --> 47:59.760
incorporated or to sell it to you and I think there's a lot of power to that number one I think the

47:59.760 --> 48:10.080
idea where creators or artists may get out competed by others who don't seek a royalty is

48:11.600 --> 48:18.560
interesting I don't quite see it that way I think the idea of creator royalties has pushed a lot of

48:18.560 --> 48:26.800
creativity and ingenuity and like just frankly it's made the creative investment into the space

48:28.240 --> 48:35.440
that much more rewarding and so brought a lot of people into it if the royalties hadn't existed

48:36.080 --> 48:41.120
I don't think there's any way we would have seen the explosion that we've seen over the past year

48:41.120 --> 48:50.640
and a half with different people entering this space that said having a you know censorship

48:50.640 --> 48:59.200
censorship resistance immutable tokens that's important an extremely important aspect to entities

49:00.000 --> 49:05.360
and it's been kind of funny to see this playing out on both sides

49:05.360 --> 49:13.920
certain marketplaces coming out against royalties we're saying that they're not going to honor them

49:14.880 --> 49:21.760
but then also seemingly reacting quite aggressive when a digital artist releases a new smart

49:21.760 --> 49:29.120
contract a new NFT and smart contract explicitly prohibits set marketplace so I think there's

49:29.120 --> 49:35.920
going to be quite a bit of gamesmanship a bit of a chess game going on here for the next couple

49:35.920 --> 49:43.520
months we certainly have a lot of different ideas internally that we are kicking around about

49:43.520 --> 49:55.040
this issue and how best to preserve the creative energy that's been and champion artist rights

49:55.040 --> 50:06.240
and also do it in a way where you maintain the what an NFT really needs to be in the openness

50:06.240 --> 50:12.240
and interoperability and censorship resistance that is integral to what we're talking about here

50:14.240 --> 50:20.400
it would seem to me that in the boarding universe you do have leveraged I'm not saying

50:20.400 --> 50:27.680
to get any music but you have leveraged because you do so many off-chain events and utility and

50:27.680 --> 50:34.400
what have you and you wouldn't you could I had written a thread on royalties and actually in my

50:34.400 --> 50:40.480
mind how the board apes and the punks could address royalties is different right because let's say

50:40.480 --> 50:44.560
there were royalties on the punks I think most bunk holders wouldn't particularly

50:44.560 --> 50:51.120
feel they'd lose anything if they went around right but on a board apel there you could say

50:51.120 --> 50:57.200
look if you trade it on this zero royalty exchange maybe next year you can't come to ape fest or

50:57.200 --> 51:00.880
you can't get into the clubhouse for six months or you have to pay your royalty to get back into

51:00.880 --> 51:04.640
the clubhouse now no this might be annoying and not to branding and I'm not saying it's a good

51:04.640 --> 51:13.200
business idea but it is a form of leverage that a project that has off-chain activities has

51:13.200 --> 51:18.480
that a project that does not really have off-chain activities doesn't have has this ever been considered

51:18.480 --> 51:25.840
discussed thought about at the same time I think there's a because of so many things that you get

51:25.840 --> 51:37.600
does I think a lot of people have been happy to pay the royalty and I would much rather run my

51:37.600 --> 51:46.800
business with a carrot than a stick and so I don't love the idea you know of course we we talk

51:46.800 --> 51:53.520
about all kinds of things but I always want to think about how can I make this the most engaging

51:53.520 --> 52:00.000
fun strange cool club in the world and have people be so excited to be a part of it then

52:00.000 --> 52:06.880
if you're coming at it from a defensive position I feel like that's an inherently weak one

52:07.760 --> 52:15.280
when it comes to a permissionless space and that's where you can frankly I think get out-computed

52:17.200 --> 52:23.760
so it's just about trying to find the right how can you create an optimistic incentive structure

52:23.760 --> 52:33.280
rather than a same negative one or a defensive one okay so you're landing basically in the

52:33.280 --> 52:39.520
people ex copy category of saying you know we're not going to harass our collectors obviously

52:39.520 --> 52:43.920
it's a social contract and you kind of want to build a collector base that wants to pay the

52:43.920 --> 52:48.480
royalties that it's a social thing not a technical thing right in the end and it's a positive

52:48.480 --> 52:54.240
they're getting enough value out of this that they're not going to try and work around it

52:54.240 --> 52:59.840
because they see value in the community something like that something like that I mean I

52:59.840 --> 53:04.960
honestly don't speak for you know all of you go and we have a lot of different ideas that you

53:04.960 --> 53:09.360
know everyone's kicking around and enjoying and and and I think the other important thing here is

53:09.360 --> 53:17.920
this is a very new space there's a lot of discussions around this whole thing going on

53:17.920 --> 53:22.240
on crypto twitter right now and it'll be interesting to see how it plays out but but that's

53:22.240 --> 53:29.520
absolutely correct I would put myself more in the the people ex copy camp of how do we just you

53:29.520 --> 53:38.800
know worry about your community and how you can best service them and your collectors and a lot

53:38.800 --> 53:45.600
of this other part will fall away without you needing to be draconian in in anyway

53:45.600 --> 53:52.560
okay let's talk about cc zero for a second in a few days I'm going to talk to four one five six

53:54.400 --> 54:01.840
founded the nouns pfp project where that project is in the public delayed it's cc creative

54:01.840 --> 54:09.520
common zero it has no royalties the money goes to some somewhat fuzzy in my mind form of treasury

54:09.520 --> 54:17.280
when it goes to treasury and in a way it's a very extreme version of what you had said previously

54:17.280 --> 54:22.560
so previously to put some words in rather than 30,000 holders of 40,000 and they have

54:23.360 --> 54:27.040
they're the core community but someone else who might not own a

54:28.080 --> 54:34.640
or a pfp might buy a board a t-shirt right there's a broader ecosystem around it and

54:34.640 --> 54:41.200
I would say the nouns are this very explicitly and more extreme right there's only one a day

54:41.200 --> 54:46.560
you know even though I don't know 30,000 PFPs are not a lot I don't think they're a lot because

54:46.560 --> 54:50.960
I want to onboard a hundred million people so not a lot the nouns are even more extreme it's

54:50.960 --> 54:57.200
going to take 82 years for there to be 30,000 nouns but then what the nouns say is not only

54:57.200 --> 55:04.240
a nouns holder can do whatever they want with their pfp identity so can anyone else and effectively

55:04.240 --> 55:11.760
what they're saying and I think what 4156 will say later in the week is we're going to start off

55:11.760 --> 55:18.240
slow because it's a slow model but eventually we're going to just pick up pure network effects

55:18.240 --> 55:25.520
that someone in you know you'll go might be doing 50 things or 30 things but they'll have to do

55:25.520 --> 55:31.280
them whereas when we've gone completely permissionless there'll be someone in Japan doing

55:31.280 --> 55:36.880
something we'll even know about it then someone in Italy doing something and if the flywheel

55:36.880 --> 55:44.720
picks up and the nouns glasses become the equivalent of the 40 logo that the now the an open

55:44.720 --> 55:51.920
source brand is to be very successful and I think I mean putting words in his mouth so we'll

55:51.920 --> 55:55.760
find out later in the week is what he says but it's how to understand from a stutter feed

55:55.760 --> 55:59.920
what are your views on this how do these two models compete coexist is one better than

55:59.920 --> 56:09.600
the other does we not know yet um I think they certainly coexist I think um both of these things

56:09.600 --> 56:19.520
are are very new um and I think it's just it's a different model whereas we're of the opinion

56:19.520 --> 56:29.200
or have structured our club in this way where set another way only a board eight the the

56:29.200 --> 56:36.000
rights to use a board eight and and put it on a t-shirt is not in itself inherently extremely

56:36.000 --> 56:46.800
valuable but what is valuable is if the club becomes a space more and more as it frankly has been

56:46.800 --> 56:52.480
for a while where a lot of people are spending an enormous amount of effort in order to develop

56:52.480 --> 57:03.120
the IP of their avatar of their creator and where cco and and this commercial rights debate I think

57:03.120 --> 57:15.680
shakes out is the idea of we're wondering who is more incentivized to build and build in a like

57:15.680 --> 57:25.680
long term thought the long term thoughtful way um somebody who owns something and um has that

57:25.680 --> 57:33.760
true ownership to the IP and so perhaps feels more comfortable or engaged to build on top of it

57:34.560 --> 57:45.040
or this very open source model that nouns is pursuing um and I don't know that there that you

57:45.040 --> 57:51.120
know there needs to be a winner and a loser I think they're inherently very different I think

57:51.120 --> 58:00.960
number one the amount of storytelling and engagement and things that we're doing on the

58:00.960 --> 58:09.760
Hugo level for our brands particularly BAYC and other side is very different than what 4156 would

58:09.760 --> 58:16.800
do or frankly want to do with nouns like they're they're trying to create something very different

58:16.800 --> 58:28.240
um at the same time the kinds of value accrual to people who create on top of either platform I

58:28.240 --> 58:35.920
think are going to be very different and how that shakes out is kind of remains to be seen

58:35.920 --> 58:46.160
uh a bit as as the model that they've taken like like he like I think he would agree just

58:46.960 --> 58:53.520
it's going to take longer to see whether or not it's truly um working as intended or not

58:53.520 --> 59:02.480
and I think but he's a very thoughtful person and is excited I think about the experimentation

59:02.480 --> 59:07.120
and the testing uh I think I was saying that they're planning on deleting their discord

59:07.920 --> 59:13.520
I saw that yeah that's um I don't I don't think we we'd ever be able to do that

59:14.320 --> 59:18.880
yeah is it is it fair to say you can go on record saying you're not planning to delete

59:18.880 --> 59:23.120
the board apes discord that's correct you know not until we've got a better replacement

59:25.600 --> 59:30.160
okay I think that's one more question about board apes and if you have time to extend I want to

59:30.160 --> 59:34.400
talk about punks another side a little bit too do you have a little bit of time to extend

59:34.960 --> 59:44.240
share yeah okay so I think largely due to board apes prominence in this space you also attract a lot

59:44.240 --> 59:51.520
of backlash in different time now mention two things that one that really surprised me one that

59:51.520 --> 59:56.560
doesn't surprise me as much a few weeks ago I was having an extensive back and forth with

59:56.560 --> 01:00:03.840
mirage of coin center and I was like you know about how they could promote NFTs you know

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:07.440
you just want you just wanted to promote ENS I mean I'm putting words in his mouth but kind of

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:11.520
and it's not that the ENS is very nice and very useful you should promote it but I mean

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.080
TFPs are like the absolute most obvious product market fit for the metaverse where the metaverse

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:22.560
is going to be I mean you're going to need a profile picture you'll need an avatar and there was a

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.000
very negative reaction from him he's like no no no no no board apes done a bunch of

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:34.080
a lot of damage to our lobbying because I'm trying to get people to take crypto seriously

01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.680
and all I'm getting is static about overpriced monkey jpegs right like him

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:45.120
yeah in the space the sounds weird outside of the space I mean mirage is not outside of the space

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:52.720
right he's a deep crypto person he's and he was like oh gosh this hurts my lobbying yeah

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.440
for this one I said well it doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to explain that TFPs are

01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:03.200
thing and they'll be expensive ones and inexpensive ones and factors hundreds of thousands

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.160
of inexpensive ones so like why is this a big deal but it does seem to bother people and I've

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:13.120
noticed them the last couple of years that I've been active one of the things although I can't

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:17.200
believe people paid this much for a cartoon this is a joke to scam it's a bubble there's that

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:22.320
so there's that kind of bucket and then there's I think a much narrower bucket that

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:31.360
there are folks who say you know does the collection reinforce stereotypes about different

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:39.520
ethnicities and is that a problem what's your view on these two topics so in regards to your

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:46.240
second question there I think I was clear earlier on when I said

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:57.520
we really see board ape as an homage to a lot of the personalities that we engage with on

01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:04.480
crypto twitter or follow it on crypto twitter years ago and it is such an affectionate term

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:13.040
that people have used for themselves as traders you know across crypto but also just across like

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.360
you know Web2 stock trading where you have AMC now coming out with a stock dividend ticker

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:30.240
and all that and so really that that's what this is about and we have always sought to create a club

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:35.360
that is extremely inclusive we were early on thought of almost more like we were getting deemed

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:40.720
on for being the care bears with the space with how like friendly our discord was as opposed to

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:51.200
say the punks discord early on and that's really important to us there are there's a playfulness

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:59.680
and an irreverence and some old school punk and hip hop traits and other things like that but it

01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.880
is all in the spirit of just fun and inclusivity and we stand against hate in every way

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:17.360
as part of your other question yeah it's been interesting to see how certain

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:29.280
crypto people have not taken teneties whereas it feels like you said to be the ultimate product

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:35.520
market fit for the open metaverse and part of it I think I think Neurosh has also been a

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:40.240
worker too where he thinks the whole idea of like the metaverse is almost scamming itself

01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:54.480
which is a bit nuts considering how much time we all spend in front of screens I think that's what

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:59.200
like you know I think biology put out a tweet yesterday about this that I thought was very apt

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:06.000
where you know what is Twitter if not a version of the metaverse people have digital

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.120
avatars and they're expressing themselves in the somewhat open system and that we are all spending

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:18.320
so much time in COVID-19 accelerated this in front of screens and so the idea of the metaverse

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:27.120
is just that we should be spending those that time in inherently open air-operable spaces the idea

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:36.000
is that a lot of the web-to- virtual experiences that we've had are maybe more akin to

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:44.000
the early internet than the current internet let's say there may be more akin to AOL where

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.000
everything exists inside of a box and it's trying to keep something that wants to be open closed

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:57.920
rather than something that's more open and if we can properly incentivize

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:05.040
monetization structures so that their community creators are being able to

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.760
derive value from what they're creating on a platform on a you know a blockchain platform

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:17.360
that's really special and that's going to change a lot of things people are already spending

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:23.920
billions of billions dollars a year on all kinds of different skins they're they're just not

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:28.160
NFTs League of Legends one of the most successful game companies world they spend you know people buy

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:34.800
like two billion dollars of you know jungle rat skins it's team of skins that like sell more than

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:44.880
anything else on that platform and so if you think of a boardade as just the nascent expression

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:52.320
of authenticity and scarcity and interoperability on the blockchain then I think you become a lot

01:05:52.320 --> 01:06:01.360
closer to understanding how this can restructure certain industries so yeah it is a little heartbreaking

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:12.080
to hear from certain people who don't get it and whose job is to educate others and are so

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:22.400
incredibly flippant about the idea of getting an education or engaging more directly with creators

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:28.400
in crypto. Look I miss both of those making a lot of sense and on this point I couldn't agree

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.720
to do more I mean it was always my mind with a bunch of people who all day looking at a screen

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:42.400
with a bunch of avatars it just happens to me called Twitter and a lot of other people in centralized

01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:49.760
games with characters and those same people are like oh I'm a pfp is on better versus practically

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:54.960
a scam you know like wait this is the better version of what you're doing right this is the actually

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:02.480
crypto native version of what you're doing this is literally the actual most likely use of

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:07.760
non custodial crypto for most people on the planet you should lean into it but we're not there

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:17.200
I believe my experience has been understanding bitcoin is kind of a zero to one experience

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:25.200
a theory of maybe like zero to one or half to one I think people a lot of people in bitcoin could

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:32.000
not get there with a theory but a lot of people did I do think NFT is our closer to a

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:38.720
not being in crypto and understanding bitcoin type experience than almost anything else

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:45.520
post bitcoin I think most people who understood bitcoin could get their heads around Ethereum even

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:52.480
if they didn't like it or Solana or Uniswap or what have you but NFTs some of my

01:07:53.840 --> 01:08:01.040
oldest crypto friends and colleagues who are in absolute OGs and crypto own 50 different tokens

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:08.080
understand everything I spent six to twelve months harassing about NFTs before I could get

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:14.320
them to sort of mentally accept the model like what this is exact same thing as bitcoin it's

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:19.920
exactly the same concept it's just the same concept for non-frontal options so I'm with you it's

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:26.320
it's strange okay we mentioned games and you mentioned games at the beginning and you know

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:33.280
multiplayer universes let's talk about other side why don't you tell us what other side is I

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.360
think a lot of the audience will know but maybe put a couple senses that are getting for those

01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.760
who don't and where are we where are we going what are we doing what are the goals on other side

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:49.440
absolutely so other side is a metaverse platform in development

01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:02.000
Yuga is obviously involved but so is improbable an incredible tech company based out of the UK

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:16.320
we had an initial customer experience about a two months ago where we had 4500 concurrent users

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.280
in one space in one virtual space it was incredible we called it first trip

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:32.560
and the thesis here is really around the idea that the metaverse should be something that exists

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:39.520
on the blockchain that it should be open and interoperable and allow people to come

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:48.000
as they are as they want to be the most special video game trailer

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.600
I ever saw as a kid was the super smash brothers trailer where you had like

01:09:56.320 --> 01:10:05.120
link Zelda but also Super Mario and Bowser and Kirby and so many other people all mashed together

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:14.480
in this world and that's close to our vision of what the metaverse can be except not just

01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:21.680
enabled by the fact of Yuga owning certain IP in the same way Nintendo does but in the fact that

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:30.720
in a world where people are creating projects that are entirely public domain or CC0 or following

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:35.920
commercial rights models like the ones that we've extended to all of our projects at Yuga

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:42.960
then any game can be kind of like super smash brothers and it was really important to us too though

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.600
where we don't want this to be like any other web2 game it's just on a blockchain

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:59.680
hey it's just a NMO but the NFT you know every asset is NFT it needs to embrace certain aspects

01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:05.840
of the metaverse that haven't been done before really and that's where having that extreme

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:14.160
density of users that's like what we showed on the first trip is is very integral to how we want

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:21.680
people and experience the metaverse we want there to be more interaction there's a lot of big

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.560
companies out there that have visions for the metaverse obviously Facebook rebranded to meta

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:34.640
I don't want to speak for anyone else but I think the vision there is very

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:45.280
hardware driven you know if there's a lot about VR and perhaps in the future AR that people

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.760
are thinking about in the metaverse whereas our vision of the metaverse is a space where

01:11:51.760 --> 01:12:00.480
just the social engagement and where we want to spend our time in digital spaces is what's

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:06.480
the most important and as somebody who grew up playing MMORPGs like every quest or Star Wars

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.720
Galaxy's or World of Warcraft there are games with absolutely atrocious graphics and frankly not

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:21.200
much better UI or UX and you know we were running on 56k modems where I have I had some of the most

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.160
important relationships in my life form on those platforms I have friends that met their significant

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:37.120
others and spouses playing MMO RPGs and I think when we have metaverse spaces where

01:12:39.440 --> 01:12:46.080
that embrace a lot of the openness that we actually had more and more back then than we do nowadays

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:54.560
with you know how much more closed source certain games are that a lot of that potentiality

01:12:54.560 --> 01:13:00.160
and that experience will open up and that that it's inherently better to build a metaverse

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:07.760
on the blockchain than it is not to and that's where feels like you can compete with absolute

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:17.440
giants where we are using a high-mind of of UDC creators to build on top of a platform

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.440
in a way where they will be able to retain the most value and so we will attract the best users

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:36.160
and other side is our bet on that where and in the same way where Warcraft 3 was a great game

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:44.240
super fun game what also had known all stars which spawned a whole industry on its own that was

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:55.840
like just creator made other side needs to be a fun game in its own right but also a platform for

01:13:55.840 --> 01:14:00.880
creators to build on top of the idea of being in the same way that Warcraft 3 was you have to show

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:08.640
people the potential introduce them to a story engage them give them you know some emotional

01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:16.880
an emotional stake in what's being built but also give them an incredible tool set to express

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.440
themselves on top of the platform and so with other side we fully intend on doing both of those

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:29.520
things and unlike a lot of different games where you get a trailer and then four years later

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:36.080
you get the game it's something that needs to be done in an iterative way where people can join

01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:44.640
experience things along the way and give feedback and properly influence the creation of

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.080
the platform itself through different SDKs and toolkits and that sort of thing and so that's

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:54.160
that's the vision for other side so when do we get to go in I think I did that first

01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.480
event convention but when when will we get you you've walked yourself into that question it's not

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:12.240
four years away when is it the persistent world will be coming in 2023 there will be multiple

01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:20.000
experiences many multiple experiences along the way but the the initial kind of persistent world

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:26.160
where people will have you know full access to the initial customer experience will be in 2023

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:34.480
so the kind of true date failure point of most things that start off with the

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:41.840
logic that they're meta versus rather than games is user persistence right you see it on

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.720
the central end of the year there's a silly argument you want do they have 30 users they are

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:51.840
4,000 users they but whatever number it is it's very low at 4,000 it's not a big number right so

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.760
even if the central ends right about their numbers they're low and then there was the Wall Street

01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:02.320
Journal article a couple days ago about meta where the biggest social media company in the world

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:11.520
and there you know people came they checked it out they didn't go back right and the concurrency

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.920
of them problems very impressive but the general failure mode of these types of things as you

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:22.080
come you look at it's oh wow it's really beautiful I see this with a 65 tonight museum district

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:27.760
people come and say oh wow look there's a massive museum and he did a great job displaying

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:33.760
generative NFTs and then okay I mean I don't know people are busy with all their lives and

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.040
we're not gonna come back and looking at every day for the same reason you don't go to the

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:46.080
mob every day right people have a life to live conceptually I understand that he is people

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:50.560
have their land and so and the tool kits without developed things and you're hoping the community

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:57.920
develops interesting things and I'll throw one more out there Tim Cook I think again today was

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:03.360
saying look it's not going to be this type of stuff it's going to be augmented reality of the

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:07.200
type of like you know you're gonna be living in your day-to-day life you'll have this cool apple

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:13.600
glasses I guess next year and I think I'm reading into it you know you'll have app-like

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:19.520
functionality you know directions or recipes or I know dinosaurs running around your house or

01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:26.160
something something along those lines what is going to bring people back into these because

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:36.240
I notice like always checking my own usage right and I definitely spend more time on Twitter

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:42.320
and in discord than it all means it's not even closer now and until that changes it means

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:46.800
the model's not right because for all of this we're going to build decentralized open

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:53.760
metaphors well I'm on two centralized platforms most of the day and most of the time that I'm not

01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:58.240
on those centralized platforms I'm an outlocking Gmail and Microsoft offers and Windows which are

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:05.680
also centralized platforms so how do we move real screen time off the centralized platforms into

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:13.200
these blockchain-based platforms yeah no it's a great point and obviously one that we think

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:20.080
about all the time as well number one I think it needs to be easy to jump in and jump out you need

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:25.840
to be able to click a button somebody links to you on Twitter and whether you're on your computer

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:34.000
or your own phone you should be able to get inside and in one click that's something that is

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:44.480
being built into how we that's how other side will function at the same time it's important

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:51.440
also think about like the way that how do successful games even the ones like you know you or I

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:58.640
would have grown up playing like really dense virtual worlds with stories and fun what drove us

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:06.000
to spend tons of time there for me it was a few things number one there was a story there was

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:17.520
a game a core game loop that was engaging and it forced collaboration if you think about I played

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:25.360
a ton of legal legends in my life I have never made a friend play that game I blocked tons of

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:29.680
people that say talk to things and are trolls on thing but I've never made a friend on the

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:37.600
web I have played legal legends friends but their friends I made playing a request or will work

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:42.000
after something else because in those traditional and the most there is a reward very tangible reward

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:48.080
frankly for interacting with other people the only reason you make a friend in the metaverse is

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:54.000
because you're getting your aspect like if you need to slay the dragon and you can do it on your

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:00.480
own and it's like step off dude this is my loop but if you have that kind of force collaboration

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:05.600
that incentivizing it then that opens up the space for some of those relationships to form

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:14.880
but do you actually spend all your time in a metaverse actually going off and slaying dragons and

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:21.120
and playing these game loops if it's anything like the games that you know I'm talking about

01:20:21.120 --> 01:20:28.960
no you actually spend a lot of time in guild chat or in the marketplace or the bizarre looking for

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:36.480
items or setting up shop or doing kind of more relaxed things and so I think it's a lot about

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.960
you know these are things that we're constantly thinking about is you need to

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.080
reward people for collaborating make it so they have to talk to people and engage with people

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:53.920
and have fun doing that and then you also need to create the spaces where it's can be

01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:03.520
the living room couch or the internet where you can just hang out with people in the same way

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:09.920
that a lot of people are using Twitter and discord to this day and so if you're not building with

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.440
those two things at the forefront then yeah I think it's your destined to fail because even those

01:21:15.440 --> 01:21:21.520
two things are very difficult to pull off yeah I think it's going to be an incredible decade of

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.000
experimentation I don't think anyone's nailed it yet I mean there's very successful games that

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.480
have effectively become metaverses I don't think anyone has started with the word metaverse

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.800
and gotten an experience really right because if you did it would be a twitter sized

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:41.440
company a Facebook size company right like you would spend all our time all right let's wrap

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:50.320
up with the punks in first quarter last year you debought the IP of the punks and the Mibits but

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:58.640
I think people care more about the punks and the larval abs punks and Mibits and beyond this being

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:06.240
like utterly shocking 21 who was there a year less than a year after the mid right I mean if you

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:14.240
could have taken odds nine months earlier one of the odds that not only the board aches the

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:18.240
punks but then by the punks and I think people would have given you a million to what odds right

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:26.560
like it's the most improbable thing that happened in the last 24 months and it was very interesting

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:39.040
because the even though the punks had this image of decentralization there actual license terms

01:22:39.040 --> 01:22:44.240
as far as anyone could tell or fairly centralized and I say as far as anyone could tell because the

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.280
larval abs founders are absolute geniuses but didn't communicate very much so a lot of people

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.800
just guessing what they were thinking and this is what I think got 4156 subset with them at the end

01:22:54.800 --> 01:23:03.040
that and he sold his his ape and so you move the punks to the commercial rights model which

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:09.840
objectively is a more decentralized model than that before there's no question about that it's

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:18.000
objectively more decentralized and I thought that was very good but also a lot of OG punks holders

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:24.320
didn't feel nice they felt disillusioned they and if you dug out it what was the thing that was

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:31.120
bothering them it felt like a corporate thing that happened you say well but you know it's just

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:34.400
as corporate before as it is now it was owned by one company outside by a different company and

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:41.120
this company is more open and I think I'm putting words in their mouth but I think this is actually

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:50.320
how it is there was a state of suspended disbelief before but like because the founders were very

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:56.720
much absent and I think in a way mostly people could just project onto the punks you know it's

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:02.240
an OG and it's an OG message and it's a message of crypto and decentralization and then the

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.440
crystallization of well that he was owned by a company now it's a bit of a company I think to

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:16.560
some some of the OG punks I don't think they loved it I mean if you know those like a mixed

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:22.240
reaction I was on the more positive of the group but I think some of the more OGs were less

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:27.920
but there's a lot of people in weight and c-mode I think like seeing like okay what will what will

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:38.480
happen now with all that how do you view the punks how do you view the punks in your broader

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:48.000
extended universe how is there your stewardship how's their pathway might be different than

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.760
the board apes what does this all mean how should how should the punks community think about

01:24:53.760 --> 01:25:00.080
the topic from your perspective yeah absolutely it's different it's completely different then

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:05.600
crypto punks is very different from board API club and so are the communities and

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:13.680
and the projects should be treated extremely differently because of that our

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:22.720
vision of crypto punks has always been that they are like the Mona Lisa of NFTs the early cave

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:34.800
paintings of NFTs they are these originals that should they be treated with respect and

01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:43.840
good stewardship will always flourish and that our job is to do just that that what's good for

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:51.440
punks is good for apes and what's good for apes is good for punks that's why frankly we wanted to

01:25:51.440 --> 01:26:00.080
own them rather than someone else who might because we felt like we understood that you know if

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:07.920
it something bad were to happen a punks it wouldn't be good for apes and the only reason

01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:14.320
we felt like we could acquire them that there was a path forward here was if we were going to as

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:21.360
you say decentralize the IP with a full commercial license in the vein of what we did for BUIC

01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:32.880
that felt to us just to be objectively better for punk holders and something that we felt like

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:45.520
was being asked for for a while we're at least clarity around it and so we have taken a slow

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:53.760
approach here and hope to continue to do so in a way that is in active communication with

01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:04.800
punk holders I know Noah meets with punks all the time and we want to act in a way that aligns

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:15.040
with the majority vision where we can do things like restore the crypto punks app marketplace where

01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:23.760
there are things that aren't quite working as intended or as they should and they can be spruced

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:36.480
up and fixed a bit of retouching to the monolith as it were but you know at most a new frame and not

01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.640
a drastic change of that so that's kind of the broad vision for how we how we view punks

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:47.600
like that makes sense it makes sense to me I think on the whole the punks don't need very much their

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:55.040
social construction will happen naturally and like most I spoke to Noah and I was trying to think

01:27:55.040 --> 01:28:00.480
of ideas and like I think a lot of ideas and I'm like yeah most of ideas are actually bad like I'm

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:06.080
not going to say anything like like most ideas probably are negative but the median idea one

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.040
could think of to do with the punks probably is not helpful to the punks right and so it takes a

01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:19.440
very I think delicate touch to see how that can be distorted without breaking because the punks I

01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:25.680
think are I think what it is because there's so low res people can project whatever they want on

01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:34.720
them and to the degree they become more physically insatiated they think they take more physical form

01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:43.200
it might break the take my image of what six five to nine means right whereas I have a board

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:48.800
I have multiple board eights of mutants and I have those they're much more detailed so my

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.360
image and your image of what my board eight look like are probably pretty close because they're

01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:58.000
much more detailed whereas like what I envision when I look at six five to nine and when you're

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:02.720
envision when I look at those and what no envision is it might be totally different and most of the

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:10.000
people have made for me all these like 3d versions of my punks and I've almost without

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.080
exception came over what I hate them I hate them look at them I'm like ah that's not how and I

01:29:16.080 --> 01:29:21.200
can't tell you what I envision it but it's not bad what action vision is this low res

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:28.320
you know that it's more of a blank slate okay well I have gone way over time and you have

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:34.960
very generous with your time I'm going to give you the floor for one more topic what question should

01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:42.320
I have asked I didn't what should we have covered that we didn't what's the closing words

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:47.280
you'd like to leave for the group question that you should have asked but you didn't I don't know

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.440
I wish we got to talk more about you know memes and shitposts or something like that

01:29:51.440 --> 01:30:00.560
some of these like that Twitter briarality that that's actually so core to crypto but you know

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:06.800
for another day what we'll see is the memes production another day but you do that in the

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:14.880
spring semester sounds great okay well thank you so thank you so much this was great and I think

01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:21.760
the students will get a ton out of this thank you so much for having me thanks for hosting

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:47.360
thank you
