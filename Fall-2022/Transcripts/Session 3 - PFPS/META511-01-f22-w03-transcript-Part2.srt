1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,680
Okay, welcome everyone and welcome Greg Salano Gargad. It is our first actual guest lecture.

2
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,640
We had Ellie in the class session, but we have a first guest visiting the course today.

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,600
And super excited about this. He is one of the co-founders of Yuga Labs. Yuga Labs today has a fairly

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,400
dominant position in the PFP area. And so I think there's going to be a lot of really interesting

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:57,440
things we can discuss starting with some basics and then getting more complicated. But first,

6
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,640
let me welcome Greg to the course. Thank you so much for having me 6529 and thanks to the

7
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,600
University of Nicosia for hosting this course. I think it's super cool. It's a really

8
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,120
exciting way for people to get exposure to a lot of different metaverse thought leaders. I'm

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,160
personally excited about a lot of people you have slated to speak later in the semester as it were.

10
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:32,240
Greg, well let's jump right in and I think for our audience is mixed. I think we have people in

11
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:40,160
the audience who are absolute NFT gurus and people who are NFT novices. So I'll try and cover

12
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,800
things that will be helpful to both. Let's start at the beginning. How did Yuga Labs, how did the

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:57,760
Bored yacht club, how did it come about? Sure. I think to tell that story, it probably helps to tell

14
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:05,840
how I was first exposed to crypto. Like a lot of people the first time I heard about Bitcoin in

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:18,800
perhaps 2010, 2011. I wasn't, I was somewhat dismissive at first. I saw it as just this, yeah,

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,440
magic internet money was how it was talked about in those early days, right? And it didn't really

17
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:36,640
capture my attention. But in 2017, I first bought into Ethereum and I immediately called a friend of mine

18
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:47,120
while I was here now, aka Gordon Connor and had him get in on, it's a crypto with me. And we fell

19
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,760
into this whole world very quickly. We spent a lot of time on crypto Twitter following all these

20
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,720
different personalities that were around. A lot of them, you know, still very active to this day,

21
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
Kobe, Lundar, you know, a lot of different folks that that have been kind of mainstays in this

22
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:19,200
space. And it was so exciting, you know, it really felt like crypto engaged our attention like almost

23
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:28,320
nothing else. Why me and I in particular would spend a lot of our time hanging out in digital spaces,

24
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,240
playing World of Warcraft or other different MMORPGs, massive multiplayer online role playing games

25
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:44,320
together and weirdly our session with crypto ran very much in parallel with it. It was a parallel

26
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:54,640
passion. And in those days, I was exposed to crypto kitties. And it was fascinating. I didn't

27
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:04,080
actually buy a cryptocurrency at the time in 2017-2018 that area while we did. But I fell into NFTs

28
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:13,440
later more deeply in 2021. There were a slew of different projects that all of a sudden felt like

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:19,920
they were using the blockchain to as more of a medium than anything else. It wasn't, you know,

30
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:29,040
crypto kitties was at its core of a game and an experience. But then when you had hash mass,

31
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,960
which was kind of this arc project that was using Ethereum as a medium and you had people

32
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,880
selling an NFT for an extraordinary camera price at Christie's, you really started to feel like

33
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:51,120
this is something where this is a new medium opening up in the same way that anything, you know,

34
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,400
podcasts opened up to the world 10 years before. And if you could be early to that and if you could

35
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,880
be one of the first people to join in and tell stories on a platform and understand how communities

36
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,480
would form around it and engage with things and what would succeed, what would be viral, it would be fun.

37
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
There's a lot of power to that because my background was in creative writing. I was a book editor

38
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,480
for 10 years. I was a poet. And so why didn't I really just were off to the races trying to

39
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,800
understand what kind of NFT project we could create? We've looped in our other two founders

40
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,320
tomato and sass aka primanzishan for the engineering part of things. And we spent some months

41
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,800
playing around with all kinds of ideas. But in the end, what we settled on was we wanted to make a

42
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,840
an NFT collection, a similar in spirit to CryptoPunks, Matt and John's CryptoPunks that obviously

43
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:02,880
have 10,000 NFTs, unique PFPs. But we wanted there to be some inherent utility to the token.

44
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,800
We wanted it to be something that you could, you know, the prime thing that we were interested in

45
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:16,080
from the beginning was NFTs as something that, you know, having a great use space for two things.

46
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,640
Authenticity and scarcity. And earlier on with CryptoKitties, those two things kind of got a little

47
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,680
out of whack with the breeding mechanics. There was too much supply, felt dilutive. But with the wave

48
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:37,440
of projects coming prominence and the kind of rediscovery or celebration of CryptoPunks that

49
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:44,480
was happening in 2021, it was really about the idea of knowing that you had this immutable NFT

50
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,520
on the blockchain, and there was only X number of them, the prominence of that. And so we came up with

51
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,760
the idea of Bored Ape Yacht Club. And the inherent utility of the token was going to be that if you

52
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,480
owned a Bored Ape Yacht Club, that you were going to be part of a club. And what that club met at the beginning

53
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,120
was just that you were among like-minded people, hopefully, but also that you got access to a

54
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,960
digital pixel board, a little space on our website, cryptographically verified that you could use

55
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:24,800
your token to get access to the, quote, bathroom and, you know, graffiti on the wall. And if you

56
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,840
own a BAYC, you could put a pixel down every 15 minutes. And so the bathroom would be kind of

57
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:39,680
this palmsest of people writing to this wall in collaboration with one another. And that was

58
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:48,080
the initial thing. And as far as the spirit of what Bordeic meant to us early on, we really saw

59
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,560
a lot of the early influencers and people in the space that we followed for years as Bordeics.

60
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,080
You know, an ape is an affectionate term in crypto and in trading circles for people who dive

61
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,240
first into an asset or kind of throw caution to the wind. There's a reason why some of the most

62
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,960
valuable apes in the crypto punk, some, why some of the most valuable NFTs in the crypto punk

63
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,520
collection are apes. And so we thought it'd be really cool to make an entire collection, an

64
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,880
entire NFT project that was just about the apes. But also that it didn't necessarily take itself

65
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:29,920
too seriously. There are people on crypto Twitter that you can cryptographically verify or

66
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:38,640
worth incredible sums of money. Yet they are spending their days shit-posting, you know, making jokes,

67
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,920
looking for people to play League of Legends with. They were in every way to us like Bordeics. And

68
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:51,200
so we started to imagine like what a this kind of fanciful, irreverent, strange world of the Bordeic

69
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,640
yacht club might look like. And we said it in our hometown of Miami. We said it in the Everglades.

70
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,680
And yeah, the rest is history. So let's talk about that. I remember the early days when you

71
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:10,640
launched. The the start didn't look shockingly promising. Like the mint didn't mint out right

72
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,320
away. It took several days. And so it's now have generated maximum coping from every one of us who

73
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,600
didn't go and mint a lot of Bordeics during that period. I think I bought one the week afterwards

74
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,080
or something. And okay, it was another PFP project that didn't mint out for several days.

75
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,880
And there was the Boughton board as you say. And when saying, oh, I wonder who's going to draw

76
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:44,800
genitals on the Boughton board, right? But from there to where we are today is kind of a shocking

77
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:55,200
difference, right? So let me put it differently. If you saw the project on day 10,

78
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,000
you could imagine a lot of projects like that on day 10, most of which have not had the success

79
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,800
or even a fractional success that the project is at. What do you attribute to the fact that

80
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,400
it started, you know, normally fun, silly, but didn't seem too serious. And suddenly it just

81
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,160
built up this life of its own and turned into what it turned into. What in your mind was that

82
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,720
magic, the secret sauce, the magic formula? What did it? Yeah, I attributed to a few things.

83
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:43,920
Number one, we tried to set up the incentive structure in a little bit different way

84
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,360
than a lot of things that had come out at the same time or just before the UIC.

85
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,760
So you had a series of different projects that were following the formula where each mint

86
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,640
would cost, you know, first X amount of been saved, thousand, cost a certain price.

87
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,320
And then the next thousand more and then the next thousand more until in the end the collection

88
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:14,080
is sold out. But that leaves you with holders that all have different entry prices into this.

89
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,000
And then it kind of felt inherently disuniting. It wasn't exactly welcoming when you would

90
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,640
join a discord and know that the guy next to you paid on the same website from the same

91
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,680
mentor for the primary sale, the different costs. It felt like something that would help sell

92
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,600
out a project, but not necessarily be healthy to the sustainability of the project.

93
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,480
Obviously, crypto punks were a free claim and, you know, completely different.

94
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,800
But at the time when we were minting in 2021, most projects in the space were following

95
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,680
this other model. So that was one of the things we did. We said every eight should cost 0.08,

96
00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:01,520
218 bucks or something like that is what it was at the time. And we tried very hard to

97
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,880
push a sense of welcoming into our discord. Anytime somebody would join,

98
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,240
we wanted there to be a stream of all caps welcome there. We wanted

99
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,800
the founders to be available for any issues people are having. If people meet it to DM us and

100
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,840
ask us questions, we were around. And I think there was a bit of magic in that

101
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:41,360
NBA top shot had just exposed a lot of new people to entities. And we found around the time

102
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,720
of the BOYC mint. A lot of those people, we were their first kind of Ethereum entity.

103
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,680
And there was a lot of excitement to that. There was a lot of people, you know, we had built

104
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:01,280
this project seemingly hoping for a lot of crypto native people to be exposed. When in fact,

105
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,480
what ended up happening was a lot of people who'd kind of put a toe into this base. Yes,

106
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,960
they bought something off coin base before or they had experimented with NBA top shots or

107
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,920
otherwise. But we were the first thing to kind of bring them into setting up a Metamask wallet

108
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:28,400
and getting involved in a community. And capturing that kind of organic energy from the start

109
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,800
and having those people so excited and finding each other. And as a reminder too, we were in

110
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:43,440
COVID. So just finding friends and engagement and having a good time on Discord is a really

111
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:52,720
powerful thing just from the start. That helped a lot. And I think also we, frankly as the founders,

112
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,920
we sold out the collection and then we worked 14 hours a day ever since to not take that moment

113
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,760
for granted and try and create new experiences in any way that we could. And I think

114
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,800
you know, when we were doing token gated merch, say a month later and boxing up T-shirts and hats

115
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,360
that we sold and we were boxing up in my mom's backyard. Yes, there had been token gated

116
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:32,000
merch before. Obviously the most famous of which would be unisocks of, you know, if you own

117
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:40,160
the token, you could redeem it for actual socks. But it wasn't necessarily a community or felt

118
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,440
like something that could be its own lifestyle brand. And the other aspect I think that was really

119
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,840
powerful the whole way through is we gave all of our holders commercial rights to their aid. And

120
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,920
that sense of having a stake in the project being part of the community and having it tied to your

121
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:09,680
online identity that was really powerful and led to a lot of projects and ingenuity and creativity

122
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,440
in a bottoms up way throughout the space where we had Jenkins de Valet very early on getting signed

123
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,160
to CAA and developing an entire, his own entire project, you know, really starting with his

124
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,240
eighth and the story that he was telling and telling other, you know, community member stories.

125
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,920
And we've now seen everything from animated TV shows that are in development to people

126
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,640
watching clothing brands, sometimes very simple streetwear, other times as incredible as like,

127
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:51,120
you know, $500, like cashmere, exquisite cashmere cardigans being sold at like Fred Segal.

128
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,400
And that's been really special. Yeah, that was a bit long-winded, but I think that covers

129
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,240
broadly speaking a lot of what I think I attribute our success to.

130
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:11,200
No, it sounds reasonable and I will say I think, you know, there was also a feeling,

131
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
maybe I'm reading this from the outside, but like there were people who

132
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,200
viewed themselves as the upstart rebels relative to the punks in some capacity, right? Like it was

133
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:32,640
the New York cohort, more fun, more irreverent, something in that direction. But I want to build on

134
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:40,400
this commercial rights issue because that had had a lot of follow-on effects in the space.

135
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:45,120
I think massive follow-on effects. I mean, if I think of the thing that probably changed the

136
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:55,120
space the most, it's this. And let's dig into it a little bit. How is that going now, right?

137
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,600
And then what I mean by this is the following. In the early days, you absolutely saw the initial

138
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,040
activity, right? Someone would do a DJ set and use their or dates or a coffee brand or a microgroup.

139
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,480
And certain people signed, as you said, to agencies. There was the group that was the music group

140
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:24,400
that was signed. First question, how is that going today a year and a half later? Are these

141
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:32,160
things that still developing? Do you have any metrics to track them? Is there, are people sticking to

142
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,920
it? Because some of the kind of the blow in the bear case on community commercial rights is

143
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:45,120
the blue case is obvious. You'll get 10,000 people working to promote the rent. The bear case is

144
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,800
probably most of those people don't actually have the capacity or capability to build

145
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,320
a viable business because building businesses is hard. In any case, not just in this case.

146
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:05,520
How do you think about it? How do you manage it? How do you track it? What does success look like?

147
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:13,200
How do you think about the softwares? Yeah, I think to start with the idea behind it,

148
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:23,520
why it made sense to us was if this token of this Bordeic cryptographically verified on the blockchain

149
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,880
by owning one, we wanted it to be your digital identity in any way you solve it,

150
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,720
that it would make sense to us to make sure that you had unlimited commercial rights to that thing

151
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:47,040
so that if you wanted to appear as your Bordeic in sandbox or in decentralized or in other side

152
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,520
or in any other kind of metaverse space, you could do that. You wouldn't have to ask permission.

153
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,240
The optionality of that whole experience is the most important part of it to me.

154
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes, there are people who, there have been people that have expanded a tremendous amount of

155
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,360
effort or are extremely talented and are building incredible things with their BAYCs.

156
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,840
There's the Bored Hungry fast food restaurant, there's Dr. von Bees,

157
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,560
Snoop Dogg's alter ego BAYC that appears with them seemingly on stage all the time these days.

158
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:30,320
There's casual sweaters being sold at some of the most revered shops in the world,

159
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,840
you know, shops in the world like Fred Siegel and there's different animated shows,

160
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:42,240
some that are still in development and some more web-3 native versions that are going to be coming

161
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:51,840
out that we're aware of. How do we measure it? How do we track it? I don't know the best answer

162
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,520
to that. The whole idea is that it's a permissionless system and that we don't necessarily need to.

163
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:04,320
If these things are able to spread up and do spread up without us, then it's doing its job.

164
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
And as long as people don't feel like there are blockers towards their

165
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,520
creativity and that's what's most important from our perspective. I don't know if that answers

166
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:26,000
your question. No, I think that's clear. I'll say it back in my words, if someone's going to make

167
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,040
their identity, this PFP their identity, well, they should be able to do whatever they want with it,

168
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:37,920
right? They don't have to go ask someone permission and then there's a normal 80, 20, or 90, 10,

169
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:44,080
or 95, 5 outcome was a few people will do it off a lot of things and most people won't do very much

170
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,600
but even if they don't do very much, it's valuable. The idea is valuable even if you don't actually

171
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,160
start a merchandise shop or a fast food restaurant a day by your board. Is that a fair assessment?

172
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,640
That's a great summary. Yeah. Okay. In that world, let's build on that. What do you see

173
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:16,560
the role of the company and the role of the network in what comes over one year, three years, ten years?

174
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:25,200
What do you do now? Because you know, you're now getting into much more verified territory.

175
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,320
Going from one million to ten million, one thing and ten million to a hundred million is another

176
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,720
thing. Now whether you look at the market cap of all your tokens or the equity value of the firm,

177
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,800
generally, we're talking billions. So now this is now moving forward at that level.

178
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,920
There's a different game than a third level. Who does what? How do they do it? How do you think about it?

179
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,800
What are the goals? How do I think about this stuff? Yeah. So I think there's a couple different

180
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:02,400
questions that I hear there. Number one, yes, you guys experienced exponential growth over the past

181
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:12,000
year and a half. In January of this year, we were 11 people today. We're 85 and we'll almost certainly

182
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:20,320
be over a hundred before the end of the year. And part of that is having several different teams,

183
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:27,120
but the ones that are most built out on the B O I C team and the other side team, that are constantly

184
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:36,000
working on projects of vastly different scale. Some things might be as small as a merch shop

185
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,920
for BAYC. And then there might be projects that have literally, you know, a year plus long

186
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:51,120
time span until lunch. And as we approach what we want to do, though, as we think of B O I C I say,

187
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:59,680
what is a Web 3 lifestyle brand? Look like a Web 3 club. Look like there's things we've talked

188
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:07,760
about like having a in real life clubhouse here in Miami where people can get together in the

189
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,640
vein, perhaps, of something like so house or ZZ's or some of these amazing membership clubs that

190
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,320
exist. That's one thing. And there's a lot of different aspects of what we're building with B O I

191
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,360
C. But I'd say the most consistent question in this time and your question about commercial rights

192
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:35,840
and what users do is how do we do things in a way that's a value add and doesn't say in

193
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:45,040
pin John or step on anyone's toes. Right now, there's several different animated series that I

194
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:51,200
know of where people are either we're using at least one word as a character in a show or something

195
00:23:51,200 --> 00:24:04,160
like that. That's awesome. If we were to come out and do, you know, our own BAYC show and

196
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:10,320
not incorporate the community then that hurts those people who are going out and doing, you know,

197
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,880
trying to tell their stories. So how can we structure our business, what we're doing as a company

198
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:27,120
in a way where we're creating sandboxes for other people to build together and enjoy the

199
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,800
commercial rights and connect with one another and all those sorts of things rather than doing things

200
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:42,960
that are redundant or duplicative or taking over things that really should be more on the community

201
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:51,920
level than otherwise. Okay, that makes sense. You mentioned twice lifestyle company, right?

202
00:24:51,920 --> 00:25:03,520
What does that mean to you? Early on, we thought of this idea of like what would a Web 3

203
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:15,200
Supreme look like. There's what's it's been very interesting over the past year and a half

204
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,520
as NFTs have gone more and more into the mainstream how different legacy companies or

205
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:33,760
industries have have taken or not to Web 3. There's a lot of game companies that are very actively

206
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,760
tripling in companies that are very actively building, exploring, enjoying, you know, the fruits

207
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:48,400
of a Web 3 division. However, there's a lot of gamers who are more reticent towards games,

208
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:55,360
towards blockchain gaming. There's a number of different reasons and thoughts on that we can get

209
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:05,360
into that later. On the other hand, you have companies like LVMH and the caring group behind

210
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,800
Gucci and Valenciaga and so many different major brands who seem to very much be leaning into

211
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:22,640
Web 3. They're thinking about, hey, here's this protocol layer tool, this tech that we can use

212
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,880
that is all about digital scarcity and authenticity. And they have these companies that that's

213
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,680
the red and butter is creating a brand and maintaining a strict level of scarcity and authenticity.

214
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:43,840
And I think for that reason, we're going to see an explosion of more and more interest from that

215
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,440
that whole sector. And that was something that we thought about very early on with BAUIC,

216
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,640
where I'm like crypto punks where the punks themselves are kind of the low. There was no crypto

217
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,520
punks logo per se. There is that kind of beautiful hot pink that they picked for the website,

218
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,480
but it wasn't really like a Nike swoosh or something like that. Whereas for BAUIC,

219
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,600
we were very cognizant of, hey, we want there to be a logo here, we want there to be a story,

220
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:22,640
we want there to be more for people to launch off of and generate stories from and content from

221
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,160
in a way where constraints and storytelling can be generative and not that we're like saying

222
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,560
strict canon and that's all there is to the story. So navigating that those lines was always

223
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:44,320
really important to us. And so, yeah, we wanted the BAUIC school to be our Nike swoosh and what

224
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:52,640
does that mean in a Web 3 space? I think there's a lot of potential there. I mean, just seeing that

225
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,920
Azuki is releasing there a new physical token standard. That's just awesome. I think we're going to see

226
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:06,800
a lot more experiments in this space. I think it's very natural for NFT company to be

227
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:16,560
diving and thinking of itself as a lifestyle brand. So, here's a question that I go back and

228
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:23,520
I think I thought about it a reasonable note. You have 30,000 PFP token holders, right? Let's leave

229
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,960
the punks out for a second. All right. So, the board apes and the mutant apes. And there's the code

230
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,480
is that I think are part of the game and are not exactly PFPs. We'll discover that, but that

231
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:41,200
even if we put those in, it's another 10,000. So, 40,000. Rolex, which is thought of as a fairly

232
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:48,000
exclusive brand, sells a million Rolexes a year. Nike, much of the scoosh, sells 800 million shoes,

233
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,120
pairs of shoes a year. So, Nike is of course a global brand and hundreds of millions of people

234
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:03,600
are part of that brand. Even Rolex, it's almost a code word for, I mean, not

235
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,800
update luxury, but luxury exclusive. Millions, tens of millions of people own a Rolex or part of the

236
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:21,120
Rolex community. Your community is 40,000 people, right? And that's closer to a superhyper elite

237
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:31,120
sub-brand of old VH or something like a Soho House, you know, 30 to 40,000 people is a very, very

238
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:43,920
elite brand. But I would say the aesthetic of, or it is more fun, less, this is a Swiss watch

239
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:49,360
that you're going to hand out, hand down to 11 generations and build a whole wing of your house

240
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,520
to put it in, right? I give it, neither one's right wrong. It's just the aesthetic that comes out.

241
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:01,520
And so, if these are somehow comparable, I don't know the numbers off hand for supreme, but I

242
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:06,240
think supreme sells a reasonable amount of goods or a reasonable amount of people on an ongoing

243
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:15,520
basis. How does this play out? Does the community need to grow? Do you become hyper elite? Is it

244
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,840
going to be, you know, Soho House is a lifestyle brand and Nike is a lifestyle brand, but Soho House

245
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,440
is a lifestyle brand that you need thousands of dollars to get into. And Nike is a lifestyle brand,

246
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:34,880
you need like, I don't know, 40 bucks to get into. How does this play out? Yeah, obviously it's a

247
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,240
question that a lot of people have been asking ever since this new wave of NFT collections have

248
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,200
come out and attained valuations that are massive. And on par with some of these companies that

249
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,160
are, we're far exceeding some of these companies that seem to have way more users. I will say,

250
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:04,000
I think there's a difference between Onigaborda for me being part of a club, let's say. And other

251
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:16,000
ways to experience things and have exposure to Bordea as a brand. And I think as we onboard,

252
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,640
more and more people into Web 3, there is going to be much more opportunities for things like

253
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:31,360
that to happen in a way that are not dilutive necessarily to the BAYC club members, you know,

254
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:38,720
the people who own the 10,000 BAYC, 20,000 mutants, but still provide, say, a tiering of access

255
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:47,040
to people to buy a BAYC t-shirt. One of our most successful merch shops all time was when we

256
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:55,760
did a drop with a collab with the hundreds. And there was a public sale colorway where anyone can

257
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,720
buy this logo mashup of the BUSE and 100s logo on the hundreds website. And I think we'll see

258
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:09,760
a lot more of that. We'll see a lot more of co-labs and ways for people to participate in the space,

259
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,920
while still maintaining the exclusivity of the club as it stands today. That feels that's very

260
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:29,360
important to us. I think it's an unfortunate aspect of some early NFT projects where breeding

261
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:37,360
mechanics got totally out of hand and felt more akin to a free-to-play model where

262
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,440
you're constantly having to devalue the original thing in order to gain a customer acquisition.

263
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,000
I think there is a much more thoughtful and sustainable model attainable where you treat it,

264
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,400
like I said, more like a brand and you're not constantly expanding the club or anything like that.

265
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:03,280
Well, it's interesting you mentioned free-to-play because this has now gotten

266
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:15,120
hot again with Gabriel Layden's Digi Di-Gruz, and it's getting a lot of attention.

267
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,480
It's not 100% clear to me how that's different than other things that happen in that

268
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:29,040
NFT space because I mean, the air drop might be free, but I went and bought a Digi Di-Gruz

269
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,280
by everything. Oh, my one of everything just to see how I feel when I heard it.

270
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:39,280
And it certainly wasn't free when I bought it. I think I paid 50 needs, so I mean, it wasn't,

271
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:44,320
I doubt I'll be playing whatever game's going to be there, but it certainly wasn't free for me to

272
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,800
play it. I had to buy it on the secondary market in OpenSea. What does free-to-play even mean in

273
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:58,640
the context of NFTs? I mean, there's a robust secondary market in these characters and it's not

274
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,160
at all free and how do we think about that? Yeah, I think about free-to-play more in a sense of,

275
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,920
you know, there's been a lot of innovations in gaming over the past 20 years that the industry

276
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,640
has changed all the time. I've never worked in gaming, but I've written books on video games

277
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:28,800
and you know, been an avid gamer my whole life. And what I think about is the different ways

278
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,280
where game companies have tried to structure incentives or subscription models to

279
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:44,720
acquire new users. And so you have something I think a lot about, for example, as it pertains to, and a

280
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,960
tease, and the future of watching gaming is Dota All-Stars. Dota All-Stars was a MOBA, so a genre of

281
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,720
video game that now, you know, we look at League of Legends and it's one of the most popular engaging

282
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,280
video games in the world. And I think I'll cryptate Twitter like the most popular video game in the world,

283
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:11,360
probably. But it really started out as this Warcraft 3 mod, this custom game mode,

284
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:20,880
called Dota All-Stars, where a user with a pseudonym, IceRog, I believe it was, and I think there

285
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:31,600
were some other people involved too, created a game using a open-source map maker of sorts,

286
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:39,200
where Warcraft 3 said, hey, if you can use our graphics, our characters, the rigs, and the map

287
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:47,200
mode, and make a game and enjoy yourselves. Have fun. Yet Warcraft 3 had no subscription model.

288
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,360
They weren't making money, they were making 10 bucks a month like they do on Warcraft or something

289
00:35:51,360 --> 00:36:02,560
like that, or 15. And IceRog had seemingly no in-platform way to monetize this either. And so you

290
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:11,440
had this setup where you had arguably one of the most popular games in the world, and nobody was

291
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:19,280
really making money directly off of it, until somebody took the learnings of this genre,

292
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:26,320
adapt it, and classed them up, professionalized them, and released League of Legends, which,

293
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,160
you know, and the rest of their history. And now you have a game that makes a couple billion

294
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,360
dollars a year, I think, selling skin, selling cosmetics that would have on a database.

295
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:46,080
So one, and that's the free-to-play model. You know, League of Legends now, they make incredible

296
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,600
amounts of money on skins, so does Fortnite, Fortnite makes double triple the amount that they do,

297
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:59,840
I think. And obviously, these are just cosmetic characters, they're fun, they're your digital avatar

298
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:07,040
in the game. You can send the friends, I think, sometimes, but oftentimes not. But you don't

299
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:16,240
know, maybe truly own these things. And then you also have a whole lot of, quote, free-to-play

300
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,760
or games that exist on the app store. People spend over a hundred billion dollars a year on the

301
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:32,800
app store, buying digital assets for games. And the way that those games work is you have to keep

302
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:41,680
buying a certain item. You'll finally show up to buy it. But seemingly, the next season,

303
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,920
there's something that's even better, and then you're showing up again and again. And with the

304
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,120
statistics show us about those games, it's about 8% of the people playing them are accounting for

305
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,520
like 90 something percent of the revenue of these games. It's a very like whale-driven market.

306
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,320
And so, when I think about the opportunity for what Gabriel's calling

307
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,800
played at own or just in general watching gaming, it's the idea of how do we create

308
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:21,600
an incentive structure where the next time somebody is creating a game on top of a platform

309
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:28,960
the way Dota All-Stars is made on top of Warcraft III, that the content creator doesn't need to go

310
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,160
off and where the person doing this doesn't have to go off and I create a YouTube channel

311
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,400
or a Patreon or something else in order to monetize the development. That the idea that these

312
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,280
things are entities at their core means that the ownership and the treatability and the access

313
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,560
and a lot more crypto-native things here will make the value grow much smoother and so that you don't

314
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:04,400
have another company popping up and sucking out all of that. And I agree, I don't know that like

315
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:15,040
that the whole play to own thing is a free to own thing is a bit of a meme here and that there's

316
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,520
been a lot of things that have functioned in this way but what I'm just excited about is the idea

317
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:32,240
of games where there's the inherent openness and interoperability of NFTs and what that opens up

318
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:42,080
for gaming across different platforms where no longer if there's that authenticity and scarcity

319
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,480
inherent NFTs and it's in a game then it feels like the traditional free to play some cost systems

320
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,920
where you're constantly developing the previous thing maybe don't need to happen if there is

321
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,640
a value of rule that can happen as opposed on like you say a platform royalty level or something

322
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,160
like that. Okay well you mentioned royalties it was on my to-do list so let's jump into it.

323
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,320
There has now I'm going to do a little background for the audience. I think through the first

324
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:24,240
couple of years of NFTs one of the things that was been promoted as a positive feature particularly

325
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:31,440
for artists is that they would earn secondary royalties and by what this means is royalties

326
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,920
on someone selling their NFTs to someone else. So a primary sale is when it sold by the

327
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,040
artist or the project creator to the user and the secondary sale is when that user sells it further

328
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:53,760
out and this was promoted both as a boon to artists who might in the beginning be less well-known

329
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,080
and might sell their work inexpensively but then they become successful and somehow they share

330
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:05,520
in the success and it has been very effective for the large and successful projects. I mean the

331
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,320
initial airdrop did not fund you go labs very much money but because the collection became

332
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:18,000
very popular and traded a lot it generated a very large income stream of royalties and this

333
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,160
was let's say state of the world until three to six months ago three to six months ago a lot of

334
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:32,640
folks from in my view the fungible claim world looked at royalties and said oh my this is transaction

335
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,040
tax in a really high one it's two and a half percent or five percent or ten percent

336
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:49,760
and this is not so we couldn't imagine like Solana or sushi or B&B taking five or ten percent

337
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,920
of your B&B every time you sell it. This is crazy and we're in a permissionless blockchain of course

338
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:06,320
the blockchain is going to route around these taxes because there's always a way technically to

339
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:15,120
run it around them and it started a process of one exchange uh said well I'm not going to

340
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,680
auto royalties or make them optional and you know I remember saying at the time I mean that's

341
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,360
clearly not a sustainable business model for them because if it works all the changes you're

342
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:34,080
going to do it um and now there's this very active debate where let's say one team

343
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:43,840
believes that the NFT project creators and artists are being hopelessly naive in expecting that

344
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:50,320
this type of royalty amounts could remain attached to the surface and the other side

345
00:42:50,320 --> 00:43:00,720
says well this is not the deal we signed up for I'm a photographer I sold you this NFT with these

346
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,440
terms and you're just violating them and I mean some of the more extreme reactions and I'm okay

347
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,000
you can sell it for no royalties but then change the metadata on a contract where the metadata

348
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,240
is not frozen and then you would have that if they were this was we had a deal this was a contract

349
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,880
we had a deal and and then kind of the third point of view which at least I think more intellectually

350
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,440
honest than the first point of view as well other artists will come out compete to artists who

351
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,080
want royalties by offering their work without royalties to me I think that's more intellectually

352
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,400
honest than people who want to change the rules of the game and then you know there's other

353
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,280
people sometimes like well we should keep it for artists but you know big projects like you

354
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,560
know they've made a lot of money they don't need them they'll sell t-shirts or access to the club

355
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,920
or other drops and on the fifth hand then I'm going to stop or if you'll say well you're just

356
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,360
going to incent project creators to dilute your initial NFTs because if they're not can't make any

357
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:02,080
money off the secondary market they'll just do more drops which might be fine for them but might

358
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:10,160
not be so great for you so be careful what you wish for and we're in this I think calm before

359
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:17,280
the storm to be honest state right what's your view on this A how do you see it playing out B

360
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:27,200
does it is it different for a pfp community for an artist and I guess where do you think we'll

361
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:34,240
settle out in one two five years on the stop so I'll start with the caveat that I'm not so much

362
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:43,280
of a futurist as has yourself in in thinking about the long term arc of you know playing out how

363
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,520
some of these things might resolve over the course of say five years I will say from the very

364
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:59,440
beginning it's been interesting how of all the different people coming into this space from

365
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:08,640
different industries let's say some of the most engaged very early on people who came from

366
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:17,840
the music industry which is an industry where people feel where creators have gotten often feel

367
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:29,120
like the creators have gotten to rock you my partner Gio series partner here at Yuga that's

368
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:37,040
certainly what interested him about the NFT space is here it is a world where creators can have

369
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:47,120
a smart contract on day one on their terms and not wait until you know whereas a lot of musicians

370
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,280
they don't they don't have a great contract day one they work their way up to it with help

371
00:45:51,280 --> 00:46:00,400
the managers and agents and all this stuff over time and so that there's that power to the idea

372
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:10,320
of creator royalties and how easy they were for a while there to set up across the space was

373
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:22,720
really powerful so that said we've always known that creator royalties were something that you could

374
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:30,480
get around you know the way it functions or those who don't know obviously is it's essentially a

375
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,280
fee that's getting paid to you by the platform not inherent to the smart contract itself so like

376
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:46,160
as if eBay or stock X decided to send a little bit of money to Nike every time somebody bought

377
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:54,240
a pair of air Jordans on on their platform and for a long time it's been extremely useful I think

378
00:46:54,240 --> 00:47:02,240
in directing liquidity and value and creators promoting marketplaces as opposed to others

379
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:13,600
I think the way that this is playing out currently is very interesting I think in part it is a

380
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:23,280
reaction to marketplace fees being too high I think in part you know a lot of the trading that's

381
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,960
happened in the past years happened by people that knew perfectly well they could have gotten

382
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:38,560
around the royalties should they have chosen to it's things like NFT trader have been around since

383
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:47,600
basically since since foray minted as far as I know and yet we've seen a lot of people

384
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,880
decide that they want to pay the royalty either the buyers want to make sure that that's

385
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,760
incorporated or to sell it to you and I think there's a lot of power to that number one I think the

386
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:10,080
idea where creators or artists may get out competed by others who don't seek a royalty is

387
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:18,560
interesting I don't quite see it that way I think the idea of creator royalties has pushed a lot of

388
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:26,800
creativity and ingenuity and like just frankly it's made the creative investment into the space

389
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,440
that much more rewarding and so brought a lot of people into it if the royalties hadn't existed

390
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,120
I don't think there's any way we would have seen the explosion that we've seen over the past year

391
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:50,640
and a half with different people entering this space that said having a you know censorship

392
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:59,200
censorship resistance immutable tokens that's important an extremely important aspect to entities

393
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,360
and it's been kind of funny to see this playing out on both sides

394
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:13,920
certain marketplaces coming out against royalties we're saying that they're not going to honor them

395
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,760
but then also seemingly reacting quite aggressive when a digital artist releases a new smart

396
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:29,120
contract a new NFT and smart contract explicitly prohibits set marketplace so I think there's

397
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:35,920
going to be quite a bit of gamesmanship a bit of a chess game going on here for the next couple

398
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:43,520
months we certainly have a lot of different ideas internally that we are kicking around about

399
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:55,040
this issue and how best to preserve the creative energy that's been and champion artist rights

400
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:06,240
and also do it in a way where you maintain the what an NFT really needs to be in the openness

401
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:12,240
and interoperability and censorship resistance that is integral to what we're talking about here

402
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:20,400
it would seem to me that in the boarding universe you do have leveraged I'm not saying

403
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:27,680
to get any music but you have leveraged because you do so many off-chain events and utility and

404
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,400
what have you and you wouldn't you could I had written a thread on royalties and actually in my

405
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,480
mind how the board apes and the punks could address royalties is different right because let's say

406
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:44,560
there were royalties on the punks I think most bunk holders wouldn't particularly

407
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:51,120
feel they'd lose anything if they went around right but on a board apel there you could say

408
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:57,200
look if you trade it on this zero royalty exchange maybe next year you can't come to ape fest or

409
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,880
you can't get into the clubhouse for six months or you have to pay your royalty to get back into

410
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,640
the clubhouse now no this might be annoying and not to branding and I'm not saying it's a good

411
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:13,200
business idea but it is a form of leverage that a project that has off-chain activities has

412
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,480
that a project that does not really have off-chain activities doesn't have has this ever been considered

413
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:25,840
discussed thought about at the same time I think there's a because of so many things that you get

414
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:37,600
does I think a lot of people have been happy to pay the royalty and I would much rather run my

415
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:46,800
business with a carrot than a stick and so I don't love the idea you know of course we we talk

416
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:53,520
about all kinds of things but I always want to think about how can I make this the most engaging

417
00:51:53,520 --> 00:52:00,000
fun strange cool club in the world and have people be so excited to be a part of it then

418
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,880
if you're coming at it from a defensive position I feel like that's an inherently weak one

419
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:15,280
when it comes to a permissionless space and that's where you can frankly I think get out-computed

420
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,760
so it's just about trying to find the right how can you create an optimistic incentive structure

421
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:33,280
rather than a same negative one or a defensive one okay so you're landing basically in the

422
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:39,520
people ex copy category of saying you know we're not going to harass our collectors obviously

423
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,920
it's a social contract and you kind of want to build a collector base that wants to pay the

424
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,480
royalties that it's a social thing not a technical thing right in the end and it's a positive

425
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,240
they're getting enough value out of this that they're not going to try and work around it

426
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,840
because they see value in the community something like that something like that I mean I

427
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,960
honestly don't speak for you know all of you go and we have a lot of different ideas that you

428
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,360
know everyone's kicking around and enjoying and and and I think the other important thing here is

429
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:17,920
this is a very new space there's a lot of discussions around this whole thing going on

430
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,240
on crypto twitter right now and it'll be interesting to see how it plays out but but that's

431
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:29,520
absolutely correct I would put myself more in the the people ex copy camp of how do we just you

432
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:38,800
know worry about your community and how you can best service them and your collectors and a lot

433
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,600
of this other part will fall away without you needing to be draconian in in anyway

434
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:52,560
okay let's talk about cc zero for a second in a few days I'm going to talk to four one five six

435
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:01,840
founded the nouns pfp project where that project is in the public delayed it's cc creative

436
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:09,520
common zero it has no royalties the money goes to some somewhat fuzzy in my mind form of treasury

437
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:17,280
when it goes to treasury and in a way it's a very extreme version of what you had said previously

438
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,560
so previously to put some words in rather than 30,000 holders of 40,000 and they have

439
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,040
they're the core community but someone else who might not own a

440
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:34,640
or a pfp might buy a board a t-shirt right there's a broader ecosystem around it and

441
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:41,200
I would say the nouns are this very explicitly and more extreme right there's only one a day

442
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:46,560
you know even though I don't know 30,000 pfps are not a lot I don't think they're a lot because

443
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,960
I want to onboard a hundred million people so not a lot the nouns are even more extreme it's

444
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:57,200
going to take 82 years for there to be 30,000 nouns but then what the nouns say is not only

445
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:04,240
a nouns holder can do whatever they want with their pfp identity so can anyone else and effectively

446
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:11,760
what they're saying and I think what 4156 will say later in the week is we're going to start off

447
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:18,240
slow because it's a slow model but eventually we're going to just pick up pure network effects

448
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:25,520
that someone in you know you'll go might be doing 50 things or 30 things but they'll have to do

449
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:31,280
them whereas when we've gone completely permissionless there'll be someone in Japan doing

450
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,880
something we'll even know about it then someone in Italy doing something and if the flywheel

451
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:44,720
picks up and the nouns glasses become the equivalent of the 40 logo that the now the an open

452
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:51,920
source brand is to be very successful and I think I mean putting words in his mouth so we'll

453
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,760
find out later in the week is what he says but it's how to understand from a stutter feed

454
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,920
what are your views on this how do these two models compete coexist is one better than

455
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:09,600
the other does we not know yet um I think they certainly coexist I think um both of these things

456
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:19,520
are are very new um and I think it's just it's a different model whereas we're of the opinion

457
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:29,200
or have structured our club in this way where set another way only a board eight the the

458
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:36,000
rights to use a board eight and and put it on a t-shirt is not in itself inherently extremely

459
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:46,800
valuable but what is valuable is if the club becomes a space more and more as it frankly has been

460
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,480
for a while where a lot of people are spending an enormous amount of effort in order to develop

461
00:56:52,480 --> 00:57:03,120
the IP of their avatar of their creator and where cco and and this commercial rights debate I think

462
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:15,680
shakes out is the idea of we're wondering who is more incentivized to build and build in a like

463
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:25,680
long term thought the long term thoughtful way um somebody who owns something and um has that

464
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:33,760
true ownership to the IP and so perhaps feels more comfortable or engaged to build on top of it

465
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:45,040
or this very open source model that nouns is pursuing um and I don't know that there that you

466
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:51,120
know there needs to be a winner and a loser I think they're inherently very different I think

467
00:57:51,120 --> 00:58:00,960
number one the amount of storytelling and engagement and things that we're doing on the

468
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:09,760
Hugo level for our brands particularly BAYC. and other side is very different than what 4156 would

469
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:16,800
do or frankly want to do with nouns like they're they're trying to create something very different

470
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:28,240
um at the same time the kinds of value accrual to people who create on top of either platform I

471
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:35,920
think are going to be very different and how that shakes out is kind of remains to be seen

472
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:46,160
uh a bit as as the model that they've taken like like he like I think he would agree just

473
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:53,520
it's going to take longer to see whether or not it's truly um working as intended or not

474
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:02,480
and I think but he's a very thoughtful person and is excited I think about the experimentation

475
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,120
and the testing uh I think I was saying that they're planning on deleting their discord

476
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,520
I saw that yeah that's um I don't I don't think we we'd ever be able to do that

477
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,880
yeah is it is it fair to say you can go on record saying you're not planning to delete

478
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,120
the board apes discord that's correct you know not until we've got a better replacement

479
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,160
okay I think that's one more question about board apes and if you have time to extend I want to

480
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:34,400
talk about punks another side a little bit too do you have a little bit of time to extend

481
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:44,240
share yeah okay so I think largely due to board apes prominence in this space you also attract a lot

482
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:51,520
of backlash in different time now mention two things that one that really surprised me one that

483
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:56,560
doesn't surprise me as much a few weeks ago I was having an extensive back and forth with

484
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:03,840
mirage of coin center and I was like you know about how they could promote NFTs you know

485
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:07,440
you just want you just wanted to promote ENS I mean I'm putting words in his mouth but kind of

486
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,520
and it's not that the ENS is very nice and very useful you should promote it but I mean

487
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:18,080
TFPs are like the absolute most obvious product market fit for the metaverse where the metaverse

488
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,560
is going to be I mean you're going to need a profile picture you'll need an avatar and there was a

489
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:28,000
very negative reaction from him he's like no no no no no board apes done a bunch of

490
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:34,080
a lot of damage to our lobbying because I'm trying to get people to take crypto seriously

491
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,680
and all I'm getting is static about overpriced monkey jpegs right like him

492
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,120
yeah in the space the sounds weird outside of the space I mean mirage is not outside of the space

493
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:52,720
right he's a deep crypto person he's and he was like oh gosh this hurts my lobbying yeah

494
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:57,440
for this one I said well it doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to explain that TFPs are

495
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:03,200
thing and they'll be expensive ones and inexpensive ones and factors hundreds of thousands

496
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:08,160
of inexpensive ones so like why is this a big deal but it does seem to bother people and I've

497
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:13,120
noticed them the last couple of years that I've been active one of the things although I can't

498
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:17,200
believe people paid this much for a cartoon this is a joke to scam it's a bubble there's that

499
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,320
so there's that kind of bucket and then there's I think a much narrower bucket that

500
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:31,360
there are folks who say you know does the collection reinforce stereotypes about different

501
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:39,520
ethnicities and is that a problem what's your view on these two topics so in regards to your

502
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:46,240
second question there I think I was clear earlier on when I said

503
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:57,520
we really see board ape as an homage to a lot of the personalities that we engage with on

504
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:04,480
crypto twitter or follow it on crypto twitter years ago and it is such an affectionate term

505
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:13,040
that people have used for themselves as traders you know across crypto but also just across like

506
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:19,360
you know Web2 stock trading where you have AMC now coming out with a stock dividend ticker

507
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:30,240
and all that and so really that that's what this is about and we have always sought to create a club

508
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,360
that is extremely inclusive we were early on thought of almost more like we were getting deemed

509
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:40,720
on for being the care bears with the space with how like friendly our discord was as opposed to

510
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:51,200
say the punks discord early on and that's really important to us there are there's a playfulness

511
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:59,680
and an irreverence and some old school punk and hip hop traits and other things like that but it

512
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:06,880
is all in the spirit of just fun and inclusivity and we stand against hate in every way

513
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:17,360
as part of your other question yeah it's been interesting to see how certain

514
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:29,280
crypto people have not taken teneties whereas it feels like you said to be the ultimate product

515
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:35,520
market fit for the open metaverse and part of it I think I think Neurosh has also been a

516
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,240
worker too where he thinks the whole idea of like the metaverse is almost scamming itself

517
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:54,480
which is a bit nuts considering how much time we all spend in front of screens I think that's what

518
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,200
like you know I think biology put out a tweet yesterday about this that I thought was very apt

519
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:06,000
where you know what is Twitter if not a version of the metaverse people have digital

520
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,120
avatars and they're expressing themselves in the somewhat open system and that we are all spending

521
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:18,320
so much time in COVID-19 accelerated this in front of screens and so the idea of the metaverse

522
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:27,120
is just that we should be spending those that time in inherently open air-operable spaces the idea

523
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:36,000
is that a lot of the web-to- virtual experiences that we've had are maybe more akin to

524
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:44,000
the early internet than the current internet let's say there may be more akin to AOL where

525
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,000
everything exists inside of a box and it's trying to keep something that wants to be open closed

526
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,920
rather than something that's more open and if we can properly incentivize

527
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:05,040
monetization structures so that their community creators are being able to

528
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,760
derive value from what they're creating on a platform on a you know a blockchain platform

529
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,360
that's really special and that's going to change a lot of things people are already spending

530
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:23,920
billions of billions dollars a year on all kinds of different skins they're they're just not

531
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,160
NFTs League of Legends one of the most successful game companies world they spend you know people buy

532
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:34,800
like two billion dollars of you know jungle rat skins it's team of skins that like sell more than

533
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:44,880
anything else on that platform and so if you think of a boardade as just the nascent expression

534
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:52,320
of authenticity and scarcity and interoperability on the blockchain then I think you become a lot

535
01:05:52,320 --> 01:06:01,360
closer to understanding how this can restructure certain industries so yeah it is a little heartbreaking

536
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:12,080
to hear from certain people who don't get it and whose job is to educate others and are so

537
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:22,400
incredibly flippant about the idea of getting an education or engaging more directly with creators

538
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:28,400
in crypto. Look I miss both of those making a lot of sense and on this point I couldn't agree

539
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,720
to do more I mean it was always my mind with a bunch of people who all day looking at a screen

540
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:42,400
with a bunch of avatars it just happens to me called Twitter and a lot of other people in centralized

541
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:49,760
games with characters and those same people are like oh I'm a pfp is on better versus practically

542
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:54,960
a scam you know like wait this is the better version of what you're doing right this is the actually

543
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:02,480
crypto native version of what you're doing this is literally the actual most likely use of

544
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,760
non custodial crypto for most people on the planet you should lean into it but we're not there

545
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:17,200
I believe my experience has been understanding bitcoin is kind of a zero to one experience

546
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:25,200
a theory of maybe like zero to one or half to one I think people a lot of people in bitcoin could

547
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:32,000
not get there with a theory but a lot of people did I do think NFT is our closer to a

548
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,720
not being in crypto and understanding bitcoin type experience than almost anything else

549
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:45,520
post bitcoin I think most people who understood bitcoin could get their heads around Ethereum even

550
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:52,480
if they didn't like it or Solano or Uniswap or what have you but NFTs some of my

551
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:01,040
oldest crypto friends and colleagues who are in absolute OGs and crypto own 50 different tokens

552
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:08,080
understand everything I spent six to twelve months harassing about NFTs before I could get

553
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:14,320
them to sort of mentally accept the model like what this is exact same thing as bitcoin it's

554
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:19,920
exactly the same concept it's just the same concept for non-frontal options so I'm with you it's

555
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,320
it's strange okay we mentioned games and you mentioned games at the beginning and you know

556
01:08:26,320 --> 01:08:33,280
multiplayer universes let's talk about other side why don't you tell us what other side is I

557
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:37,360
think a lot of the audience will know but maybe put a couple senses that are getting for those

558
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:41,760
who don't and where are we where are we going what are we doing what are the goals on other side

559
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:49,440
absolutely so other side is a metaverse platform in development

560
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:02,000
Yuga is obviously involved but so is improbable an incredible tech company based out of the UK

561
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:16,320
we had an initial customer experience about a two months ago where we had 4500 concurrent users

562
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,280
in one space in one virtual space it was incredible we called it first trip

563
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:32,560
and the thesis here is really around the idea that the metaverse should be something that exists

564
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:39,520
on the blockchain that it should be open and interoperable and allow people to come

565
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:48,000
as they are as they want to be the most special video game trailer

566
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:55,600
I ever saw as a kid was the super smash brothers trailer where you had like

567
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:05,120
link Zelda but also Super Mario and Bowser and Kirby and so many other people all mashed together

568
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:14,480
in this world and that's close to our vision of what the metaverse can be except not just

569
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,680
enabled by the fact of Yuga owning certain IP in the same way Nintendo does but in the fact that

570
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:30,720
in a world where people are creating projects that are entirely public domain or CCO or following

571
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:35,920
commercial rights models like the ones that we've extended to all of our projects at Yuga

572
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:42,960
then any game can be kind of like super smash brothers and it was really important to us too though

573
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:49,600
where we don't want this to be like any other web2 game it's just on a blockchain

574
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:59,680
hey it's just a NMO but the NFT you know every asset is NFT it needs to embrace certain aspects

575
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:05,840
of the metaverse that haven't been done before really and that's where having that extreme

576
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:14,160
density of users that's like what we showed on the first trip is is very integral to how we want

577
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:21,680
people and experience the metaverse we want there to be more interaction there's a lot of big

578
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:26,560
companies out there that have visions for the metaverse obviously Facebook rebranded to meta

579
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:34,640
I don't want to speak for anyone else but I think the vision there is very

580
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:45,280
hardware driven you know if there's a lot about VR and perhaps in the future AR that people

581
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:51,760
are thinking about in the metaverse whereas our vision of the metaverse is a space where

582
01:11:51,760 --> 01:12:00,480
just the social engagement and where we want to spend our time in digital spaces is what's

583
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:06,480
the most important and as somebody who grew up playing MMO RPGs like every quest or Star Wars

584
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,720
Galaxy's or World of Warcraft there are games with absolutely atrocious graphics and frankly not

585
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:21,200
much better UI or UX and you know we were running on 56k modems where I have I had some of the most

586
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:28,160
important relationships in my life form on those platforms I have friends that met their significant

587
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:37,120
others and spouses playing MMO RPGs and I think when we have metaverse spaces where

588
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:46,080
that embrace a lot of the openness that we actually had more and more back then than we do nowadays

589
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:54,560
with you know how much more closed source certain games are that a lot of that potentiality

590
01:12:54,560 --> 01:13:00,160
and that experience will open up and that that it's inherently better to build a metaverse

591
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:07,760
on the blockchain than it is not to and that's where feels like you can compete with absolute

592
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:17,440
giants where we are using a high-mind of of UDC creators to build on top of a platform

593
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:25,440
in a way where they will be able to retain the most value and so we will attract the best users

594
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:36,160
and other side is our bet on that where and in the same way where Warcraft 3 was a great game

595
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:44,240
super fun game what also had known all stars which spawned a whole industry on its own that was

596
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:55,840
like just creator made other side needs to be a fun game in its own right but also a platform for

597
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:00,880
creators to build on top of the idea of being in the same way that Warcraft 3 was you have to show

598
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:08,640
people the potential introduce them to a story engage them give them you know some emotional

599
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:16,880
an emotional stake in what's being built but also give them an incredible tool set to express

600
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,440
themselves on top of the platform and so with other side we fully intend on doing both of those

601
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:29,520
things and unlike a lot of different games where you get a trailer and then four years later

602
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:36,080
you get the game it's something that needs to be done in an iterative way where people can join

603
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:44,640
experience things along the way and give feedback and properly influence the creation of

604
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,080
the platform itself through different SDKs and toolkits and that sort of thing and so that's

605
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,160
that's the vision for other side so when do we get to go in I think I did that first

606
01:14:54,160 --> 01:15:00,480
event convention but when when will we get you you've walked yourself into that question it's not

607
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:12,240
four years away when is it the persistent world will be coming in 2023 there will be multiple

608
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:20,000
experiences many multiple experiences along the way but the the initial kind of persistent world

609
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,160
where people will have you know full access to the initial customer experience will be in 2023

610
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:34,480
so the kind of true date failure point of most things that start off with the

611
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:41,840
logic that they're meta versus rather than games is user persistence right you see it on

612
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,720
the central end of the year there's a silly argument you want do they have 30 users they are

613
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:51,840
4,000 users they but whatever number it is it's very low at 4,000 it's not a big number right so

614
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:55,760
even if the central ends right about their numbers they're low and then there was the Wall Street

615
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:02,320
Journal article a couple days ago about meta where the biggest social media company in the world

616
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:11,520
and there you know people came they checked it out they didn't go back right and the concurrency

617
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,920
of them problems very impressive but the general failure mode of these types of things as you

618
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,080
come you look at it's oh wow it's really beautiful I see this with a 65 tonight museum district

619
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:27,760
people come and say oh wow look there's a massive museum and he did a great job displaying

620
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,760
generative NFTs and then okay I mean I don't know people are busy with all their lives and

621
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,040
we're not gonna come back and looking at every day for the same reason you don't go to the

622
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:46,080
mob every day right people have a life to live conceptually I understand that he is people

623
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,560
have their land and so and the tool kits without developed things and you're hoping the community

624
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:57,920
develops interesting things and I'll throw one more out there Tim Cook I think again today was

625
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:03,360
saying look it's not going to be this type of stuff it's going to be augmented reality of the

626
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:07,200
type of like you know you're gonna be living in your day-to-day life you'll have this cool apple

627
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:13,600
glasses I guess next year and I think I'm reading into it you know you'll have app-like

628
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:19,520
functionality you know directions or recipes or I know dinosaurs running around your house or

629
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:26,160
something something along those lines what is going to bring people back into these because

630
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:36,240
I notice like always checking my own usage right and I definitely spend more time on Twitter

631
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:42,320
and in discord than it all means it's not even closer now and until that changes it means

632
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:46,800
the model's not right because for all of this we're going to build decentralized open

633
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:53,760
metaphors well I'm on two centralized platforms most of the day and most of the time that I'm not

634
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,240
on those centralized platforms I'm an outlocking Gmail and Microsoft offers and Windows which are

635
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:05,680
also centralized platforms so how do we move real screen time off the centralized platforms into

636
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:13,200
these blockchain-based platforms yeah no it's a great point and obviously one that we think

637
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:20,080
about all the time as well number one I think it needs to be easy to jump in and jump out you need

638
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:25,840
to be able to click a button somebody links to you on Twitter and whether you're on your computer

639
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:34,000
or your own phone you should be able to get inside and in one click that's something that is

640
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:44,480
being built into how we that's how other side will function at the same time it's important

641
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:51,440
also think about like the way that how do successful games even the ones like you know you or I

642
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:58,640
would have grown up playing like really dense virtual worlds with stories and fun what drove us

643
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:06,000
to spend tons of time there for me it was a few things number one there was a story there was

644
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:17,520
a game a core game loop that was engaging and it forced collaboration if you think about I played

645
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:25,360
a ton of legal legends in my life I have never made a friend play that game I blocked tons of

646
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,680
people that say talk to things and are trolls on thing but I've never made a friend on the

647
01:19:29,680 --> 01:19:37,600
web I have played legal legends friends but their friends I made playing a request or will work

648
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:42,000
after something else because in those traditional and the most there is a reward very tangible reward

649
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:48,080
frankly for interacting with other people the only reason you make a friend in the metaverse is

650
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:54,000
because you're getting your aspect like if you need to slay the dragon and you can do it on your

651
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:00,480
own and it's like step off dude this is my loop but if you have that kind of force collaboration

652
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:05,600
that incentivizing it then that opens up the space for some of those relationships to form

653
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:14,880
but do you actually spend all your time in a metaverse actually going off and slaying dragons and

654
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:21,120
and playing these game loops if it's anything like the games that you know I'm talking about

655
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:28,960
no you actually spend a lot of time in guild chat or in the marketplace or the bizarre looking for

656
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:36,480
items or setting up shop or doing kind of more relaxed things and so I think it's a lot about

657
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,960
you know these are things that we're constantly thinking about is you need to

658
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:48,080
reward people for collaborating make it so they have to talk to people and engage with people

659
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:53,920
and have fun doing that and then you also need to create the spaces where it's can be

660
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:03,520
the living room couch or the internet where you can just hang out with people in the same way

661
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:09,920
that a lot of people are using Twitter and discord to this day and so if you're not building with

662
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:15,440
those two things at the forefront then yeah I think it's your destined to fail because even those

663
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:21,520
two things are very difficult to pull off yeah I think it's going to be an incredible decade of

664
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,000
experimentation I don't think anyone's nailed it yet I mean there's very successful games that

665
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,480
have effectively become metaverses I don't think anyone has started with the word metaverse

666
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:36,800
and gotten an experience really right because if you did it would be a twitter sized

667
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:41,440
company a Facebook size company right like you would spend all our time all right let's wrap

668
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:50,320
up with the punks in first quarter last year you debought the IP of the punks and the Mibits but

669
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:58,640
I think people care more about the punks and the larval abs punks and Mibits and beyond this being

670
01:21:58,640 --> 01:22:06,240
like utterly shocking 21 who was there a year less than a year after the mid right I mean if you

671
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:14,240
could have taken odds nine months earlier one of the odds that not only the board aches the

672
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:18,240
punks but then by the punks and I think people would have given you a million to what odds right

673
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:26,560
like it's the most improbable thing that happened in the last 24 months and it was very interesting

674
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:39,040
because the even though the punks had this image of decentralization there actual license terms

675
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:44,240
as far as anyone could tell or fairly centralized and I say as far as anyone could tell because the

676
01:22:44,240 --> 01:22:49,280
larval abs founders are absolute geniuses but didn't communicate very much so a lot of people

677
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,800
just guessing what they were thinking and this is what I think got 4156 subset with them at the end

678
01:22:54,800 --> 01:23:03,040
that and he sold his his ape and so you move the punks to the commercial rights model which

679
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:09,840
objectively is a more decentralized model than that before there's no question about that it's

680
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:18,000
objectively more decentralized and I thought that was very good but also a lot of OG punks holders

681
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:24,320
didn't feel nice they felt disillusioned they and if you dug out it what was the thing that was

682
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:31,120
bothering them it felt like a corporate thing that happened you say well but you know it's just

683
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,400
as corporate before as it is now it was owned by one company outside by a different company and

684
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:41,120
this company is more open and I think I'm putting words in their mouth but I think this is actually

685
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:50,320
how it is there was a state of suspended disbelief before but like because the founders were very

686
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:56,720
much absent and I think in a way mostly people could just project onto the punks you know it's

687
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:02,240
an OG and it's an OG message and it's a message of crypto and decentralization and then the

688
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:07,440
crystallization of well that he was owned by a company now it's a bit of a company I think to

689
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:16,560
some some of the OG punks I don't think they loved it I mean if you know those like a mixed

690
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:22,240
reaction I was on the more positive of the group but I think some of the more OGs were less

691
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:27,920
but there's a lot of people in weight and c-mode I think like seeing like okay what will what will

692
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:38,480
happen now with all that how do you view the punks how do you view the punks in your broader

693
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:48,000
extended universe how is there your stewardship how's their pathway might be different than

694
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,760
the board apes what does this all mean how should how should the punks community think about

695
01:24:53,760 --> 01:25:00,080
the topic from your perspective yeah absolutely it's different it's completely different then

696
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:05,600
crypto punks is very different from board API club and so are the communities and

697
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:13,680
and the projects should be treated extremely differently because of that our

698
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:22,720
vision of crypto punks has always been that they are like the Mona Lisa of NFTs the early cave

699
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:34,800
paintings of NFTs they are these originals that should they be treated with respect and

700
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:43,840
good stewardship will always flourish and that our job is to do just that that what's good for

701
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:51,440
punks is good for apes and what's good for apes is good for punks that's why frankly we wanted to

702
01:25:51,440 --> 01:26:00,080
own them rather than someone else who might because we felt like we understood that you know if

703
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:07,920
it something bad were to happen a punks it wouldn't be good for apes and the only reason

704
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:14,320
we felt like we could acquire them that there was a path forward here was if we were going to as

705
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:21,360
you say decentralize the IP with a full commercial license in the vein of what we did for BUIC

706
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:32,880
that felt to us just to be objectively better for punk holders and something that we felt like

707
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:45,520
was being asked for for a while we're at least clarity around it and so we have taken a slow

708
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:53,760
approach here and hope to continue to do so in a way that is in active communication with

709
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:04,800
punk holders I know Noah meets with punks all the time and we want to act in a way that aligns

710
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:15,040
with the majority vision where we can do things like restore the crypto punks app marketplace where

711
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:23,760
there are things that aren't quite working as intended or as they should and they can be spruced

712
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:36,480
up and fixed a bit of retouching to the monolith as it were but you know at most a new frame and not

713
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,640
a drastic change of that so that's kind of the broad vision for how we how we view punks

714
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:47,600
like that makes sense it makes sense to me I think on the whole the punks don't need very much their

715
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:55,040
social construction will happen naturally and like most I spoke to Noah and I was trying to think

716
01:27:55,040 --> 01:28:00,480
of ideas and like I think a lot of ideas and I'm like yeah most of ideas are actually bad like I'm

717
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:06,080
not going to say anything like like most ideas probably are negative but the median idea one

718
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:11,040
could think of to do with the punks probably is not helpful to the punks right and so it takes a

719
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:19,440
very I think delicate touch to see how that can be distorted without breaking because the punks I

720
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:25,680
think are I think what it is because there's so low res people can project whatever they want on

721
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:34,720
them and to the degree they become more physically insatiated they think they take more physical form

722
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:43,200
it might break the take my image of what six five to nine means right whereas I have a board

723
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:48,800
I have multiple board eights of mutants and I have those they're much more detailed so my

724
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,360
image and your image of what my board eight look like are probably pretty close because they're

725
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:58,000
much more detailed whereas like what I envision when I look at six five to nine and when you're

726
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,720
envision when I look at those and what no envision is it might be totally different and most of the

727
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:10,000
people have made for me all these like 3d versions of my punks and I've almost without

728
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:16,080
exception came over what I hate them I hate them look at them I'm like ah that's not how and I

729
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:21,200
can't tell you what I envision it but it's not bad what action vision is this low res

730
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:28,320
you know that it's more of a blank slate okay well I have gone way over time and you have

731
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:34,960
very generous with your time I'm going to give you the floor for one more topic what question should

732
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:42,320
I have asked I didn't what should we have covered that we didn't what's the closing words

733
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:47,280
you'd like to leave for the group question that you should have asked but you didn't I don't know

734
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:51,440
I wish we got to talk more about you know memes and shitposts or something like that

735
01:29:51,440 --> 01:30:00,560
some of these like that Twitter briarality that that's actually so core to crypto but you know

736
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:06,800
for another day what we'll see is the memes production another day but you do that in the

737
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:14,880
spring semester sounds great okay well thank you so thank you so much this was great and I think

738
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:21,760
the students will get a ton out of this thank you so much for having me thanks for hosting

739
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:47,360
thank you
