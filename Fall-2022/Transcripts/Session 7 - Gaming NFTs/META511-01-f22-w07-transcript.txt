 Hello, hi everyone. Welcome to the seventh week of the University of Nicosia free MOOC on NFTs and the metaverse. This is George Giaglis and today our topic of discussion is going to be gaming NFT. So we're going to be discussing gaming today. So today's session, I would dare say it's sort of a bridging session because as you know, this is a 12-week course we've done, we've covered the first six weeks which were about NFTs. So we did an introduction and we saw the various use cases and application areas of non-fungible tokens. As of next week, we're going to move to the second part of the course which is more about Web3 and the Metaverse. And today's session is sort of transit or sort of trying to bridge these two areas in the sense that it is my personal feeling that many people will first experience the metaverse through some sort of a game. So I'd like to spend some time today discussing the various types of games, the history of gaming, how do NFTs fit with a future of gaming and how these could facilitate the transition to a more immersive, more persistent digital experience for everyone, what we usually define as the metaverse. So we will start by going through a short history of video games, and how it all started. And I'm not going to, it's totally impossible to cover everything of course, but I'll try to go through the major milestones trying to give you a perspective in the sense that where we are today and where we're probably heading tomorrow in terms of our gaming experiences is something that is very compatible with what has happened so far and although we might sometimes tend to think of blockchains and NFTs as a hugely disruptive experience, I think it's somehow the natural next step in the evolution of gaming. We'll discuss a little bit the process of creating games, not because I'm going to turn any of you into gaming designer production experts, again, we cannot do this in the short time of one session, but because I think it is important to understand the various dimensions so that we can see why existing blockchain-based games and why existing gaming NFTs have still not managed to live up to their expectations. So the complexities and intricacies of the process of creating games make it quite difficult. We will discuss the main types of benefits that blockchains bring into gaming, namely the ability to facilitate a real ownership of game assets for the players, the ability to transfer assets between games and to create an interoperable in-game or across-game economy. We'll discuss a little bit later again, not trying to do an exhaustive review. This is everything that we're discussing are still phenomenal that are under development, so we're just going to see where we are today and what the potential next steps might be and maybe talk a little bit about the size of the market in-game. As usual, our disclaimer, this is educational material only, so although I will be referencing a number of projects in this presentation, none of them is included for anything else apart from an indicative example for educational purposes. So please do your own research if you decide to delve more in-depth into any of the projects that are mentioned in these schools. So let's start with the first argument that I'd like to make. The argument, as I've said, is that games can be thought of as very early examples of Metaverse. So those of you that in the audience that are already gamers know what I'm talking about because you know that many of the MMORPGs that exist out there look and feel like what most of us think about as the Metaverse. Obviously, with a very specific setting of the virtual world and a very specific objective and gameplay and the types of things that are happening are not like a virtual world as a whole is a very specific, narrow virtual world, but a virtual world nevertheless. So I think as I've said that games can be thought of as proton Metaverse, so very early examples of Metaverse and I think many of us are going to experience the Metaverse through games. I like this definition of what a game is. I'm not really sure that we need the definition, but nevertheless it's always good to start with a common perspective. A game is an interactive experience, so it's something that is between players or between a player and a computer and it's an experience that provides a player with an increasingly challenging sequence of patterns which the player learns and eventually masters. So most of the games will make the player go through a series of steps, tasks, challenges or whatever that are of increasing difficulty until either the player loses or the game concludes with some successful and some games have an objective, others you still continue playing for as long as you can and there's never a natural finish and successful finish to the game. So according to this definition, you can think of video games as having three main components. One is a user interface, so the player needs to somehow interact with the game and usually, this would happen through a console, a joystick, a controller, some sort of motion-sensing device or what have you. There needs to be a video display device early on, it might be our TV, now a computer monitor, tomorrow maybe a virtual reality headset, but there needs to be something that shows us the virtual world through which we traverse while we're playing the game and there needs to be a storyline, there needs to be a setting, there needs to be a context, there needs to be a virtual world on which the action of the game takes place and if you think about it, the combination of these three things, so having a virtual world out there, a virtual world that is displayed in some sort of output device which could be immersive, it could be a virtual reality headset. The last ability to interact, live and do things within this world sounds a bit like what the metaverse would be about, I mean we'll formally define the metaverse next week, but I think most of us would agree that a virtual world in which we exist as a character and do things and receive feedback and interact with other players or with the virtual world is what a metaverse is all about, that's why I'm saying that the video games can be thought of as sort of metaverse type of experiences. The history of video games is quite old, I mean beginning of the 70s with things like Zolk, for those of you that are into text-based, a bunch of games or with arcades like punk which was the first ping pong themed arcade game and you see here on the right the type of game that I'm talking about, but remember this is 1972, we're 10 years before the introduction of the personal computer, so this is a very, very protto type of experience in an arcade type of interface where you have very simple two-dimensional graphics effectively, two players or one player and the computer, it's controlling a dash that moves up and down the screen and there's a ball moving in between and if you might not to cut the ball and throw it to your opponent, then the game continues, if you don't then you lose a point and this is how it all goes. Pong was developed by Atari, one of the very famous gaming computer developers of the 70s and the 80s, Atari has a very special place in my heart along with the Commodore and the ZX Spectrum and all these computers because these were the first types of computers that I interacted with, so Atari is a legend in the early computer gaming era, Pong was a very interesting game, it was created by a guy called Alan Alcorn and it was not created to be a commercial game, it was created as a training exercise given to Alan by his boss, one of the Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell, so Alan did such a great job that Atari thought, wow, we gave this as an exercise but there's probably an opportunity here to commercialize this, so they did and they commercialized it like this, when we're talking about games in the 70s, this is the setting that we're talking about, standard loans, special made, you know, for Godboards that included the screen and they, and some controls as you can see here on the left there are two controls for the two players that are playing Pong and there's a coin inserting machine, so you would go to a mall, to a supermarket, to a shop that had arcade games and you would play this game for money, there were no computers, there were no, there was no way in which you could do this at home, the big revolution and the big advancement in gaming was when we made the transition from arcade consoles, so when computer games started the kind of home entertainment again from the 1970s, you can see on the right picture of two kids playing the same game, this is Pong now, but now they're playing it at home in a console which is connected to the home computer. This, the fact that games entered our homes created an explosion in the types of games, so there are, I mean, nearly countless genres of games today, games would most typically be categorized according to the interaction and the game place will have adventure games or fighting games or puzzle games or shooter games or sports and so on. And another big distinction is whether we're talking about first-person or third-person games, so like the picture that you see there on your left, you are the character holding the machine gun but you never see your actual avatar, you never see your character, the whole world revolves around your own point of view. And the third person games like the example we see on the right, you control a character that you can see in front of you and you see how he or she might interact with their environment. Another way of classifying games could be according to their dimensionality, so we'll have 2D games, the early examples of games where we like have very crude graphics both for the avatars and for the surrounding world, so Super Mario as you can see there on the left is an example of such a game and I'm not trying here to make an argument that says that two dimensional games are worse than 3D games, they are just older and there's a different type of modality of interacting with a virtual world and I'm saying this because I might be proven wrong here but contrary to what most people expect or predict, I think there's going to be a sizable market for metaverses in the beginning at least of the commercial era of the metaverse where the world around us would be deliberately simple, so everything in a computer is a model of reality and we can decide what type of abstraction we want to have against that reality, so many designers and producers and providers and then users I think would choose to go to simpler models where they can focus more on the social interaction rather than be consumed by the elaborate details of the worlds around them but that's one possible direction and some people will take that path, others might choose to go to more realistic, photorealistic I mean games, so we have 3D games now like the most you see on your right where your view of the world is essentially a 3D camera perspective, either first person or third person as we discussed and there are some games in between these two like the payments from the middle from Wolfenstein which was the first game that popularized the shooting games, a genre where there was a sort of a pseudo 3D environment in the sense that everything was in reality 2D, there were no 3D models there but the use of two dimensional sprites creating the impression to users that they were seeing a 3 dimensional world. Now the most important distinction of games and most important for the purposes of this lecture because again trying to make a point that would lead us to NFTs and Web3 is that most video games would be classified as what we call RPGs like role-playing games in the sense that when you play the game you assume the role of a character and you take control of the actions of that character. So most of the video games are RPGs. One sub-gender of RPGs that became popular, especially in the 80s and beginning of the 90s, is what we would call multi-user dimension, original it was called multi-user dungeon or multi-user domain games, it became popular with the art from the mud anyway. Dungeon because it started from from adventure games that used to take place in the world's characterised by dungeons and the distinguishing characteristic of these games was that they were typically text based or storyboarded. So there were not elaborate graphics, sometimes there were no graphics at all, a player would enter a world which was usually fantasy or science fiction inspired world and they would receive text based descriptions. So you are now in the forest you see you know housing front of you, this was a typical like an introduction to Zork, one of the first text-based adventure games but the distinguishing characteristic of muds was that they were multi-player, there were many players that could play the game at the same time and they could have either an adversarial or a collaborative relationship between them depending on the game and how it works. So sometimes you would you know be there to kill other players or to cooperate with them in order to achieve some objective and this sounds sort of like you know trivial today but it was far from trivial back then the ability to create worlds that would accommodate many users. So mud was the mud types of games were the first games that created an internet type of experience for the users back then in the early 90s many people back then discovered what we call today the internet so a worldwide connected network of computers through playing such kinds of games but because of you know bandwidth or technology limitations these games were usually very limited in terms of their graphical interfaces. Now, RPGs and muds came together and evolved in what today we would call MMORPGs or massively multiplayer online wrong playing games which are video games here we're talking now about virtual worlds that have you know a very significant graphical interface sometimes with a very high degree of photorealism and allow a massive number of players I mean I'm talking in the range of even millions of players to play the game at the same time. Another distinguishing characteristic of these games and this is characteristic that is very important for us is that these games feature what we would call persistent worlds in other words we're talking about games where if you as a player stop playing the game the game still continues to exist other players are there the world evolves things happen so next time you go back online you might find a very different environment because things have happened while you were away and this is something that okay for the younger people here that you know the first types of games that they got used to were MMORPGs might sound like a natural thing but for us it's a total revolution it was a total revolution because previous types of games existed only as far as long as I was playing them the moment that I stopped playing the game when you know I got offline or when I got the game over sign the game didn't exist there the world stopped existing it came into existence and it stopped being there when I entered and when I stopped playing the game MMORPGs are the first example of persistent worlds and as we will be discussing next week because persistence is a very important defining characteristic characteristic of the metaverse I would say that you know most early metaverse is that we will say enjoying some type of real commercial success in the sense of having many users in them will feature some sort of game like persistency in the experience of the users now these games have become hugely popular those of you that play such games know that already for those of you that you know all these are new there are games like World of Warcraft where the total player counts people that have accounts play that game are like you know in the in the hundreds of millions and there might be more than a million people playing the game at the same time around the world so we're talking about really really popular really successful and mass adopted games in the in the respective communities and this has resulted naturally in gaming being a huge industry I mean I come from I from a blockchain and crypto type of background into this course so for me you know the fact that you know the whole crypto industry is worth around a trillion is like you know mind blowing hugely successful but we're talking here about an industry in which you know there are the number of cryptocurrency users are measured in the in the hundreds of thousands of millions around the world here we're talking about an industry in which almost half the world more than 3.2 billion people worldwide play some sort of computer game many of these people play MMORPGs but not only that and there's a very aggressively growing isport industry where the audiences have grown to more than a half a billion people in 2022 so you think about it almost one every two persons in the whole world are playing games and around one since 16 people are watching video games being played competitively by other players so this is a huge industry and if it somehow makes the transition to the to to to to web 3 it's going to be you know a killer app for for for blockchains for web 3 and for NFTs in general the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than 250 billion dollars by 2025 so we're talking about a huge industry there's you know console based marketplaces where you can get games like Nintendo PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox and stuff like that whole industry of course mobile games iOS Google play around draw it and so on a huge number of websites and a huge number of platforms that provide access to gaming to desktop computers of which I think Steam is the largest they support around 70,000 gaming titles the industry is huge and being dominated by players that come from all backgrounds so you see technology companies like Microsoft you see consumer electronics companies like Sony you see game studios like I don't know electronic cards and games like Rob blocks being in the top 10 of of the gaming industry and you see the top 10 companies have market caps that range from tens of billions of dollars to to okay Microsoft has a huge market cap but it's not only gaming so we're talking about a very very big industry that might make the transition towards web web 3 in the coming years now this this was a very quick like introduction to the history of gaming and how we we have arrived where we are today with NFT games but before discussing this I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing game development so the games that you saw a couple of static images from in the previous slides like I don't know world of Warcraft or Minecraft or similar types of games are very very complex competitive projects to to develop they need huge teams of engineers of artists of designers and of producers to be coordinated and to be to be able to create something that is not a one of thing it's not like you know Hollywood movie where you might also need a similar type of of of array of people coming together and coordinating themselves for a limited amount of time until the the movie gets out to theaters and then that's it here we're talking about an ongoing process of always you know improving developing and evolving the game while the game is being played and especially when they came in the case of MMORPGs you need to be able to deploy like upgrades in real time while millions of people are using the product so we're talking about a very complex and there go and I'm I'm saying this because I won't I want you and I want people like me also to be a bit lenient when it comes to judging the the gameplay the design and the the general complexity and sophistication of blockchain based that games that we see around us because we're trying to compare what huge companies with billions of dollars of market cap and thousands of employees are able to produce after you know 10 or 15 years in the industry with what a team of you know five or 10 start-upers might be doing in a whole new technology with whole new types of assets like fans of the lot non-fansable tokens and sometimes I see reports saying you know yeah but none of these games are fun to play or you know sophisticated enough or whatever what do you expect did you expect that you know a team of people that have just released a game that there's no throw them path and there's no prior learning or whatever would be able to achieve anything close to what a very sophisticated professional public company making billions of dollars is producing I mean it's sort of expected that you would see the types of games that we see in the in the blockchain and the crypto world today so anyway coming back to the team you would need engineers obviously and not only people that would actually code and program the software but especially when we're talking about console based games also people that would design and manufacture and integrate the hardware on which the software will be running you would need a huge array of artists because you would need people that would define the concept what is the game vision the storyline and everything you would need people that would do the 3D modeling of everything within the virtual world the environment the characters the assets you would need texture artists that would add textures and details to the 3D models created by the by the modulus you would need people that would spend their time working on lighting and motion capture and sound and all these things if you if you attended and watched the discussion of 6 5 to 9 with people the other day you would you might remember how much time and energy people was telling us that he was he's spending when he's creating he did the alert not in actual you know modeling or customizing the models that he started working from but actual is sculpting or photographing or playing with the lighting around these these objects that he creates so you will need designers you will need people to design the mechanics of the gameplay to design the modalities of player interaction and so forth and you need a production team that would actually bring everything together would deal with this as a project with specific you know milestones and deadlines and and phases and what have you and they was they would liaise with the business units that would commercialize or market or sell the game so we're talking about about very big teams and that's why sometimes we make distinctions between what we call indie and triple-a game so there are publishers that can afford having all these things and they are like they're the Hollywood type of of actors in the gaming industry and there are indies so an indie game would be produced by an independent studio or a small number of individuals and this is you know all the games in the blockchain world I guess I spoke about mechanics so the mechanics of the gameplay is a very very important thing because it defines all the rules and procedures that guide the player and they also dictate what the game responses to the player's moves or actions can be an interesting thought here is that many games most of the games that we have today in order to not confuse the player or not create a steep learning curve for a new player they try to adhere to the laws of physics so you know when you leave an object in the game it will fall down you know pulled by gravity as it would in the physical world however you you understand of course that there is no reason for this to happen in the digital world we are free from all these constraints so in the metaverse sphere I would expect that we would see some very original or experimental modalities regarding game mechanics or world function mechanics where the world would not necessarily work like it does in the physical world so we might you know free ourselves from the limitations of the physical world in these environments another important aspect is creating assets and here you would need to have access to quite sophisticated software for 3D modeling either to create characters like you see in the picture in the top of the screen which is I think from blender one of the software's the open source type of software for 3D modeling all creating you know the details like the last and best practices in the in the machine gun that you see in the in the image below which is from a map software I think is from 3D studio mark so you would need to have all these things to create assets and here I'm still talking about design creating the assets you would need to enrich the assets that come from your 3D modeling software and you usually start from some sort of mathematical polygonal type of structure to create and that texture and details and lightning and stuff like that on top of this and all this work is still to create the asset itself which could be part of the virtual world could be a playing character it would be a non-playing character within a game it would be a weapon or a shield or a uniform or you name it and has nothing to do with the actual gameplay and ownership and transferability and where you would be able to find and how you would be able to sell or swap or or trade these types of assets so the learning outcome here is that creating a sophisticated competitive game is a very very competitive process there are there are a number of game engines so there are a number of software environments that can be used to allow game designers to bring everything together so 3D modeling gameplay mechanics as a creation interaction between players and non-playing characters and so on examples are unreal engine or unity or cryogen that you see here in this slide and there is also a huge body of work in developing standardized libraries for APIs and software interfaces for either 3D graphics processing hardware like your GPUs in your computer like OpenGL and WebGL or more proprietary types of APIs like DirectX by Microsoft for those that are programming games on Microsoft platforms now having said all these and I understand that this is a very very quick and shallow introduction to the technologies and processes around game creation I would like to focus the remainder of our time on what we're interested in today's like what happens when the technology of blockchain when cryptocurrency when fans will talk and some non-fansy bit tokens and NFTs meet gaming how might we see the future of gaming through this through this lens and as I've said in the beginning I think that there are three major types of implications that blockchain will have in gaming blockchain being a technology that allows for value creation storage and transfer over computer networks I think it will have a substantial effect on gaming because it will provide a much needed layer for storing and transferring value in gaming and I think there are three things there one is asset ownership so who owns the assets in a game there's this famous story that Vitalik Butterin thought of a non-substralized Ethereum when I don't remember which game he was playing but they they deprived him of one of the weapons or sales that he had managed to to earn by playing the game and he realized that you know although he thought that because this was in his inventory it was his it was actually not there was not there's no real ownership of your character your avatar your asset your weaponry or whatever when you're playing a game everything is being controlled centrally by the game provider so if they won't they can they can throw you out of the game they can you know block your account or they can deprive you of any asset that you might have had so blockchain will will change all that because it would allow people to actually really own their assets that they use in the games and when I say really own I mean they would have the ability to not only trade them with other users but also do that and many other things outside of the game so when you are when you have the asset in your wallet as an NFT you might use it in this particular game but the asset becomes also interoperable it it can be used in other things so for example many of you have minted the course access token for unique this is a token that you give you access to some of the material for the course and certainly the the exams so it's a token that helps utility within the ecosystem of this course but nothing stops someone from creating some other experience which could be educational a game or what have you and have this experience token gated controlled and and affected by the ownership of this token so have create something that is accessible only by people who happen to have this asset on their wallet so assets become more important than the games themselves I don't know how many of you are familiar with projects like loot for adventurers or the end project in the NFT space but both these projects and many others have started have flipped the idea of a game on its head and they said why should we create a game and have assets only within this game and not create the assets first so create a set of I don't know weapon and and and and shields and shoes and helmets and so on with different powers and different degrees of rarity and aesthetics and so on and let everyone use the collection of these this becomes an NFT collection of assets in the games or arts or or experiences that they create so we're talking about a wholly different perspective on how we view games if we have blockchain enabled NFTs as assets in them and the final like effect of of blockchain into gaming is the ability to create in-game and sometimes hopefully in the future across game economies so create whole economic structures with supply and demand dynamics in which value is distributed to users and controlled by the users within the game and not monopolized by the platform creating the game itself so again NFTs allow for true bits the longer support for game assets so if if you hold your characters or avatar as an NFT you are the real owner it cannot be taken away from you any asset that you buy or you collect while playing the game can also be an NFT and then you can swap or trade with other players without any intermediaries and without any possible censorship by the game owner and they can also exist as I've said outside the game as independent entities that might have other users or internal values so the collection of these four properties that you see in this slide create a revolutionary out there say environment on how assets in games can be thought of that was simply not possible in the pre-block chain world even in the MMORPG era. This has created a number of experiments one of them that I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing because it has received quite some attention by the community at least the blockchain community is the so-called played-win games so as the names suggest these are games in which the economics go to the next level because they allow their players to play the game for some sort of financial game not in the sense of gaining from other players so like betting and battling and whoever wins takes the money and wins the bet but in the sense of creating adding value, creating new value that is created by playing the game itself. There are typically two broad categories those that are called free-to-play games so you thought you can start playing the game for free although if you do that you most probably will be limited in your ability to to gain money from playing it or the so-called pay-to-play games in the sense that users will need to be equipped by some sort of NFT so you would need to get an avatar or weapons or your shoes or whatever so you need to buy NFTs you need to invest in the game in the beginning and once you've made that investment depending on how good you are in the game and how powerful or rare the properties of your NFTs are you might earn money usually in the form of some digital tokens which has fluctuating value so you know the whether these games would be able to create sustaining economies is a different question that we're going to say in a while. Typically in such games that players will be able to create or breed new characters so you would be able to you know literally breed your characters and create new ones that you can either use for playing or sell in the marketplace you would be able to purchase items either within the game or in third party marketplaces and you would typically be able to unlock or earn additional digital assets or tokens by playing the game depending on you know how long you played or how good you are at it and so on. The archetypal example here is actually infinity I'm not going to spend so much time on it because I think it's it's it's all news now but I don't think any discussion about play to earn would be complete without discussing. Actually, because it was the first game that became hugely successful I mean at some point a year or a year and a half ago there were you know lots of people especially in countries like the Philippines where it was extremely popular but were actually you know doing it as they had job they were making money by playing the game. What is typical about Axia is that they pioneered this dual token structure so these games usually have more than one types of tokens so they have both fungible and non-fungible tokens and the fungible tokens usually are split between a governance token in the case of Axia if it's the A-XS the Axia and the SARTs token and a utility token in the case of Axia Gold smooth love smooth I thought the small anyway smooth or small love potion the SLP token which is the reward token or the utility token that people would earn and there's also NFT tokens in the in the case of Axia the playing characters are NFTs the Axia themselves as well as tokenized lots of land that act as forms or basis of operation for the activity the game is about you know battling with with other opponents your Axia against them so it's mostly a card-based game in which players playing Terrence is not very interactive there are a number of games that have been developed following us on same or similar ideas I have just some indicators examples here so allian worlds or galaxy fight club or go-jansane they are I would dare say and forgive me because it's a very simplistic type of description and maybe unfair to them they are advanced versions of Axia infinity in the sense that they follow a similar trajectory in terms of creating environments in which characters fight or battle its other end players you know might make money if they win against their opponents a different Sam Zendre is the one in the in the bottom projects like Stepping or Genopets which are what we would call move-to-earm games in the sense that they would reward users for their daily movements so the more that you walk or run or okay in the case of Genopets is much more complicated because you have a this this virtual pet so on top of you know banking steps you might do other things it's more move-to-earm and plate-to-earm type of game but all of them or most of them have the same basic underlying economic structure in the sense that there are a number of NFTs so in the galaxy fight club you have your your your fighter and you have weapons that this fighter is equipped to and depending on you know what type of fighter or what type of weapon you might have different abilities in battle and so the outcome of the game would be a combination of your skills combined with the the types of assets that you own in the case of Stepping how much money you would make would depend on a combination of factors like you know what type of shoe you have so this is an NFT what type of added properties you have equipped these shoe with and different shoes have different properties and these properties have different values so for different uses there are different optimal configurations of of your shoes so quite complicated but at the same time this complication might you know increase the the the joy or the the satisfaction that users get by playing the game so these types of games exist today but I would like to emphasize that we are still extremely early in the NFT gaming phenomenon not only played one games but generally and I said earlier that we sometimes tend to be unfair to the people that create are creating these games because we we compare them with you know huge conglomerates that have been hugely successful in monetizing web 2 types of games but these people are startups that are trying to redefine an industry and it has proven to be very challenging to create a self-sustaining in-game economy so as I've said most of the projects are using a dual layer structure so both fudgeable tokens and NFTs and a multi-tokens structure within its layer so you might have a governance and a utility token and multiple NFTs but I have yet to see a successful token economics mechanism so if you if you witness most of the projects they they follow a trajectory in which at least their utility token if it doesn't have enough utility it tends to to to fall in value because people would sell it if they have nothing to do with it within the game and this of course creates a selling pressure that that combined with the infinite supply utility tokens that most projects would follow will result in a in a death spiral for the price of the token it is interesting because some analysts go as far as claiming that the play to earn movement itself is not sustainable because giving monetary rewards may prove to be bad for player retention because it weakens the internal motivation that players would have at playing the game I'm not sure I subscribe to this line of thought I think there's a very huge incentive for people to to play games for some monitor game gain and you know if if we are if we are true believers in our conviction that web 3 is about taking value from the platforms and giving it to the users then you know all these billions that we discussed earlier being made today by the gaming industry and being shared by a small group of you know companies that control it we will we will you know flow through to to the end users if and when we start fighting finding self-sustainable economic models for that a more fair criticism is that most games today seems to emphasize the token no mix what I've discussed earlier more than game design but we have to understand that for game design on blockchain we have huge technical challenges which at the moment prevent us from creating a hundred percent decentralized games remember the metaphor I used earlier we are in the early days of the internet so was the first popular games in the internet era where months there were games that allowed many people to play together but they were text based or storyboarded because you couldn't have sophisticated graphics in the primitive internet infrastructure we have the same thing here we have blockchains that are very slow transactions are public so you cannot have a real-time game you cannot have a game in which you know if I do something and this something creates a transaction the blockchain and this is published you know 12 seconds ago in a later in Ethereum then my character will wait for 12 seconds before you know it fires a bullet out of their weapon this is a very bad user experience so we need to solve these technical problems but I'm not worried technical problems like it happened in the early days of the internet and many people thought back then that this would be you know the lack of speed or security or whatever would be something that would condemn internet to oblivion and of course it didn't happen I am sure that the technical challenges will be solved in the meantime we will be looking at games that are only partially decentralized and when I say partially I mean the characters the avatars and the assets are decentralized they exist on public blockchains and they are truly owned by the players but the gameplay mechanics are still centralized and they happen on centralized servers so concluding this this session I would like to just emphasize four points number one is that gaming is huge and if gaming moves to blockchain and mass so this will prove to be a killer application for NFTs I know that with 6 5 to 9 you've discussed a lot about art and generative art and PFPs and all these things and these are all fine applications but I think gaming is going to prove to be one of the killer application of NFTs and of course PFP collections and even generative and stuff like that have a huge role to play within gaming the second takeaway is I think that blockchain will act as the value layer in games providing three things one is true ownership of assets by users number two interoperability of assets so the ability to move assets across games and number three creating sustainable in-game and across game economics take away number three there are still significant challenges to be overcome many of them are technological and design oriented we still haven't figured ways in which we we can move game mechanics to the blockchain and some challenges are economic we still haven't managed to find the perfect balance between you know governance utility and non-fungible tokens to create a you know self-sustaining economy within a game finally keep in mind and we'll discuss this next week with 6 5 to 9 in more detail that games can be thought of as early examples of metaverses and may yet prove to be the application type through which most people will have their first work-free exposure as always we have some further reading for you and this concludes the slides for for this week if you have questions let me move to discord I mean as usual as you can say in the screen you can ask your questions in the om chat or on Twitter using the nft qna hashtag my colleagues will probably have already started feeding questions on discord for me so let me switch and see if I can find them there and I have my colleague Chris Chris too from the unique virtual reality lab with me showing case there are questions that are more technical because as I said I don't come from a from a gaming background I might call him to to join me in answering them so let me see so there's one question that says is it actually sustainable to release a token for a game that can be exchanged for fiat well that's that's you know that's a million dollar question it's certainly certainly this is the case we have it is proven by the gaming industry that people there's lots of people out there there's a big market for gaming so there's lots of people that would actually be able to you know open their wallet and pay money to play a game they pay literally billions every year to play games whether this could translate in a sustainable mechanism through which that money flows into an in-game economy in blockchain and allows that value to be multiplied between the users of that economy and somehow shared between those that create the game those that play the game and those that provide the foundational infrastructure for security and scalability so the underlying blockchain this is something to to to get we need we need we need to to see how this could happen I have to say that out of the examples that I showed you earlier and all the others that I've seen in the NFT gaming space this hasn't happened yet and I think it has happened for two reasons one is that there hasn't been a game yet that would attract people for the intrinsic motivation there have not been games like I don't know Minecraft or Roblox or the world of Warcraft or all the other games that have managed to create communities of millions of people that want to play the game for the shared pleasure of playing the game and even pay to play that game here we have mostly seen people that come like kamikaze you know getting into the game to make a quick gain out of it and this mentality does not help the community of a very particular game to to create a lasting with real life with games games option that is more organic and less important people that play the game because they like it and they're not ready to leave it to go to the next game because they would make more money in short term out of it I'm not saying it's not I see myself some sort of internet let me know okay sweet okay I will continue saying that you know they will not do it maybe it's a process some of the games that we've seen become useful for a community or a longer amount of time like actually infinity or stepping might make it but go through you know so what happened they went down now they will go up and find you know an equilibrium but I think to answer your question that we will see games and we will see games very soon that people would be willing to use their tokens inside the game sell it outside the game for fiat and there will be a thriving you know demand and this is becoming the speed of blockchain transactions I mean yeah question blockchain scalability is is a challenging thing I mean I've been in blockchain since the very beginning you know Satoshi chose a 10 minute interval between blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain because it wasn't possible to propagate transactions in the network in in in in a less amount of time so that all miners would know of the latest block and and we'll be able to start working the next one when the previous one was mine so the Bitcoin blockchain had and still has a 10 minute interval between between books now moved to my 12 interval between blocks so in 10 years time because Bitcoin started in 2009 we're not 2022 so 13 years time we have gone from 10 minutes to 12 seconds and there's all sorts of solutions for scaling that further and new technologies are coming all the time either for layer 2 like optimistic roll-ups or zero knowledge snarks or or other ways all for layer ones that have much much less demands in terms of space or computing power or synchronization nodes and so on so I'm sure that in the future this problem will be solved but for the time being because games need a near instantaneous type of reactions when I when I have a shoot game and you find weapon it's the bullet to go watch it it's target of not hit it's targeting and do whatever it will do instantaneously I cannot wait 12 seconds I cannot even wait two seconds for the experience would be detrimental so my personal six times of game the first types of games will be becoming not going to be like huge requirements terms of speed that's why we're seeing you know card-based games in which players play in terms so there's no real-time interaction we see the move to earn type of standard you get free for or stepping or or whatever because these things do not have with and and real-time interaction requirements it will probably be a few years before we start seeing the migration of of in directive games to the block today I have to wait until the holographic technology comes out and then games will be the ultimate experience that's very interesting and I think I will I will answer this question then we can probably wrap this up in reader science world there have been two technologies that have have how can I say have invited the radical of researchers in different points in time one was artificial intelligence that started in the late 60s with lots of unfair and you know expectations never managed to to deliver much until the the discovery of neural networks and deep learning a few years ago and suddenly we have a solution the other technology is virtually everything that has to do with virtualization of the around us either pure virtual reality or of managed reality has up to now more high than reality so to address the students comment I will yes I agree if and when we see a holographic uh uh uh technology come out or um uh uh to be too heavy and difficult to use and we'll not have a huge latency and I will not get these after using them for 10 minutes or whatever yes there's huge potential for virtual long-term reality and also to be extremely uh and this happened we'll discuss all these in a couple of weeks because we have a dedicated session in transing visualization technology I think Chris would have a lot to uh to say then but until the time that these technologies become really um um let's say come to to to standard in which they can be commercially deployed uh for the mass market need some time so uh we'll say another question is what incentive to current game designers have to explore or adopt blockchain in their games don't they currently benefit from their centralized approach the answer is a clear yes uh but that has never stopped the world progressing it's you know heard this argument time and again and says you know what incentive does Kodak have to invest in digital photography don't they profit from you know analog photography the answer is yes they did profit but some competitor will disrupt them and will if they do not adapt to the new technologies they will die so for the studios and the game designers and the big technology companies that decide now it should be more to have a centralized approach i'm not looking at blockchain as a as an alternative they might be lucky and blockchain never makes it but if it does you know in 10 years time many of the household names that we know today will be in history like Kodak or Fuji are in the analog for those business and they are not they will be substituted by others so i think this concludes today's lecture thank you very much for for being with us next week we'll have a 6 5 2 9 discussing the metaverse thank you very much for being here and see you next week bye bye you
