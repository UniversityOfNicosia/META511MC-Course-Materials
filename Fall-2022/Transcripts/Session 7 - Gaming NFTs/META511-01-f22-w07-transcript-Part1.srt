00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,800
Hello, hi everyone,

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:32,880
welcome to the seventh week of the University of Nicosia's free MOOC on NFTs and the Metaverse,

3
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,720
this is George Giaglis and today our topic of discussion is going to be gaming NFTs,

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,600
so we're going to be discussing gaming today.

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,640
So today's session, I would dare say is sort of a bridging session because as you know,

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,720
this is a 12-week course we've done, we've covered the first six weeks which were about

7
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
NFTs,

8
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,560
so we did an introduction and we saw the various use cases and application areas of non-fungible

9
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,560
tokens.

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,000
As of next week, we're going to move to the second part of the course which is more about

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,960
Web3 and the Metaverse.

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,400
And today's session is sort of transit or sort of trying to bridge these two areas in

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:32,760
the sense that it is my personal feeling that many people will first experience the metaverse

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,200
through some sort of a game,

15
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,200
so I'd like to spend some time today discussing the various types of games, the history of

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:51,760
gaming, how do NFTs fit with a future of gaming and how these could facilitate the transition

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:00,200
to a more immersive, more persistent digital experience for everyone, what we usually define

18
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,200
as the metaverse.

19
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,120
So we will start by going through a short history of video games, and how it all started,

20
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,800
and I'm not going to, it's totally impossible to cover everything of course, but I'll try

21
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:26,760
to go through the major milestones trying to give you a perspective in the sense that

22
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,400
where we are today and where we're probably heading tomorrow in terms of our gaming experiences

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,240
is something that is very compatible with what has happened so far and although we might

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,920
sometimes tend to think of blockchains and NFTs as a hugely disruptive experiences, I think

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,760
it's somehow the natural next step in the evolution of gaming.

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,480
We'll discuss a little bit the process of creating games, not because I'm going to turn

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,880
any of you into gaming designer production experts, again, we cannot do this in the short

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,520
time of one session, but because I think it is important to understand the various dimensions

29
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:19,280
so that we can see why existing blockchain-based games and why existing gaming NFTs have still

30
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,640
not managed to live up to their expectations,

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:30,000
so the complexities and intricacies of the process of creating games make it quite difficult.

32
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We will discuss the main types of benefits that blockchains bring into gaming, namely

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,440
the ability to facilitate real ownership of game assets for the players, the ability

34
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,600
to transfer assets between games and to create an interoperable in-game or across-game economy.

35
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:03,960
We'll discuss it a little bit later again, not trying to do an exhaustive review.

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,400
This is everything that we're discussing are still phenomenal that is under development,

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:19,160
so we're just going to see where we are today and what the potential next steps might be

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,600
and maybe talk a little bit about the size of the market in-game.

39
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,600
As usual, our disclaimer, this is educational material only, so although I will be referencing

40
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,200
a number of projects in this presentation, none of them is included for anything else

41
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:43,400
apart from as an indicative example for educational purposes.

42
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,640
So please do your own research if you decide to delve more in-depth into any of the projects

43
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,200
that are mentioned in this course.

44
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,400
So, let's start with the first argument that I'd like to make.

45
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:06,760
The argument, as I've said, is that games can be thought of as very early examples of

46
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
Metaverses,

47
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:12,280
so those of you in the audience that are already gamers know what I'm talking about

48
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:21,960
because you know that many of the MMORPGs that exist out there look and feel like what

49
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,160
most of us think about as the Metaverse.

50
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:32,680
Obviously, with a very specific setting of the virtual world and a very specific objective

51
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:38,800
and gameplay and the types of things that are happening are not like a virtual world

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,400
as a whole is a very specific, narrow virtual world, but a virtual world nevertheless,

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,600
so I think as I've said that games can be thought of as proton Metaverse, so very

54
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,640
early examples of a Metaverse and I think many of us are going to experience the Metaverse

55
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:00,440
through games.

56
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,040
I like this definition of what a game is,

57
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,440
I'm not really sure that we need the definition, but nevertheless, it's always good to start

58
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
with a common perspective.

59
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,320
A game is an interactive experience, so it's something that is between players or between

60
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:21,760
a player and a computer and is an experience that provides a player with an increasingly

61
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,680
the challenging sequence of patterns which the player learns and eventually masters,

62
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:37,480
so most of the games will make the player go through a series of steps, tasks, challenges

63
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:47,240
or whatever that are of increasing difficulty until either the player loses or the game

64
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,960
concludes with some successful and some games have an objective, others you still continue

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,040
playing for as long as you can and there's never a natural finish and successful finish

66
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,760
to the game.

67
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:14,560
So according to this definition, you can think of video games as having three main components.

68
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,280
One is a user interface, so the player needs to somehow interact with the game, and usually

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,760
this would happen through a console, a joystick, a controller, or some sort of motion sensing

70
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,120
device or what have you.

71
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,360
There needs to be a video display device early on, it might be our TV, now a computer monitor,

72
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,560
tomorrow maybe a virtual reality headset, but there needs to be something that shows

73
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:50,000
us the virtual world through which we traverse while we're playing the game and there needs

74
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,320
to be a storyline, there needs to be a setting, there needs to be a context, there needs to

75
00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,520
be a virtual world in which the action of the game takes place and if you think about

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,680
it, the combination of these three things, so having a virtual world out there, a virtual

77
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,440
the world that is displayed in some sort of output device which could be immersive, it could be

78
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
a virtual reality headset.

79
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,600
The last ability to interact, live and do things within this world sounds a bit like what the

80
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,520
metaverse would be about, I mean we'll formally define the metaverse next week, but I think

81
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,680
most of us would agree that a virtual world in which we exist as a character and do things

82
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,880
and receive feedback and interact with other players or with the virtual world is what

83
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,040
a metaverse is all about, that's why I'm saying that video games can be thought

84
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,440
of as sort of metaverse type of experiences.

85
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:59,240
The history of video games is quite old, I mean beginning of the 70s with things like

86
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:07,640
Zolk, for those of you that are into text-based, a bunch of games or with arcades like punk

87
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:16,240
which was the first ping pong-themed arcade game and you see here on the right the type

88
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,880
of the game that I'm talking about, but remember this is 1972, we're 10 years before the introduction

89
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:33,520
of the personal computer, so this is a very, very proto type of experience in an arcade

90
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:43,920
type of interface where you have very simple two-dimensional graphics effectively, two

91
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,760
players or one player and the computer, is controlling a dash that moves up and down

92
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,760
the screen and there's a ball moving in between if you might not cut the ball and throw

93
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:03,640
it to your opponent, then the game continues, if you don't then you lose a point and this

94
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,600
is how it all goes.

95
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,920
Pong was developed by Atari, one of the very famous gaming computer developers of the 70s

96
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:25,560
and the 80s, Atari has a very special place in my heart along with the Commodore and the

97
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,720
ZX Spectrum and all these computers because these were the first types of computers that

98
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:39,440
I interacted with, so Atari is a legend in the early computer gaming era, Pong was a

99
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,760
very interesting game, it was created by a guy called Allan Alcorn and it was not created

100
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,320
to be a commercial game, it was created as a training exercise given to Allan by his boss,

101
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:59,000
one of the Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell, so Allan did such a great job that Atari thought,

102
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:06,280
wow, we gave this as an exercise but there's probably an opportunity here to commercialize

103
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,320
this, so they did and they commercialized it like this, when we're talking about games

104
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,760
in the 70s, this is the setting that we're talking about, stand-alone, special made,

105
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,480
you know, whole 'cupboards' that included a screen and they, and some controls as you can see

106
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,120
here on the left there are two controls for the two players that are playing Pong and

107
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:40,080
there's a coin-inserting machine, so you would go to a mall, to a supermarket, to a shop that

108
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,480
had arcade games and you would play this game for money, there were no computers, there were

109
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:55,640
no, there was no way in which you could do this at home, the big revolution and the big

110
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:03,600
advancement in gaming was when we made the transition from arcade consoles, so when computer

111
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,920
games started the kind of home entertainment again from the 1970s, you can see on the right

112
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,600
a picture of two kids playing the same game, this is Pong now, but now they're playing

113
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:24,880
it at home in a console that is connected to the home computer.

114
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:33,240
This, the fact that games entered our homes created an explosion in the types of games,

115
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:41,960
so there are, I mean, nearly countless genres of the game today, games would most typically

116
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,120
be categorized according to the interaction and the game place will have adventure games

117
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,360
or fighting games or puzzle games or shooter games or sports and so on.

118
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,800
And another big distinction is whether we're talking about first-person or third person

119
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:10,680
games, so like the picture that you see there on your left, you are the character holding

120
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:18,280
the machine gun but you never see your actual avatar, you never see your character, the

121
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,920
the whole world revolves around your own point of view.

122
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:28,600
In the third person games like the example we see on the right, you control a character

123
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:36,000
that you can see in front of you and you see how he or she might interact with their environment.

124
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,760
Another way of classifying games could be according to their dimensionality, so we'll

125
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,920
have 2D games, the early examples of games where we like have very crude graphics both

126
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:55,240
for the avatars and for the surrounding world, so Super Mario as you can see there on the

127
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,160
left is an example of such a game and I'm not trying here to make an argument that says

128
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,720
that two-dimensional games are worse than 3D games, they are just older and there's

129
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,920
a different type of modality of interacting with a virtual world and I'm saying this

130
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:27,880
because I might be proven wrong here but contrary to what most people expect or predict, I think

131
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:36,080
there's going to be a sizable market for metaverses in the beginning at least of the commercial

132
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:44,000
era of the metaverse where the world around us would be deliberately simple, so everything

133
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,640
in a computer is a model of reality and we can decide what type of abstraction we want

134
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,360
to have against that reality, so many designers and producers and providers and then users

135
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:09,560
I think would choose to go to simpler models where they can focus more on the social interaction

136
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:18,760
rather than be consumed by the elaborate details of the worlds around them but that's one possible

137
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:27,880
direction and some people will take that path, others might choose to go to a more realistic,

138
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:34,480
photorealistic I mean games, so we have 3D games now like the most you see on your right

139
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,840
where your view of the world is essentially a 3D camera perspective, either first person

140
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:49,600
or third person as we discussed and there are some games in between these two like the

141
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:57,120
payments from the middle from Wolfenstein which was the first game that popularized the shooting

142
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:09,400
games, a genre where there was a sort of a pseudo 3D environment in the sense that everything

143
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:19,520
was in reality 2D, there were no 3D models there but the use of two-dimensional sprites

144
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:28,400
creating the impression to users that they were seeing a 3-dimensional world. Now the

145
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:35,320
most important distinction of games and most important for the purposes of this lecture

146
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:44,800
because again trying to make a point that would lead us to NFTs and Web3 is that most

147
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:53,480
video games would be classified as what we call RPGs like Role Playing Games in the sense

148
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,760
that when you play the game you assume the role of a character and you take control of

149
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:08,080
the actions of that character, so most of video games are RPGs. One sub-gender of

150
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:14,720
RPGs that became popular especially in the 80s and beginning of 90s, was what we would

151
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:24,080
call multi-user dimension, originally it was called multi-user dungeon or multi-user domain

152
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:29,920
games, it became popular with the art from the MUD anyway. Dungeon because it started

153
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:35,960
from adventure games that used to take place in the worlds characterised by dungeons

154
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:44,640
and the distinguishing characteristic of these games was that they were typically text-based

155
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,440
or storyboarded. So there were no elaborate graphics, and sometimes there were no graphics

156
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:57,480
at all, a player would enter a world that was usually fantasy or science fiction inspired

157
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,720
world and they would receive text-based descriptions. So you are now in the forest you see you know

158
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,040
housing front of you, this was typical like the introduction to Zork, one of the first text

159
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,600
based adventure games but the distinguishing characteristic of MUDs was that they were

160
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:23,800
multi-player, there were many players that could play the game at the same time and they could

161
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,160
have either an adversarial or a collaborative relationship between them depending on the

162
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:37,520
game and how it works, so sometimes you would know be there to kill other players or

163
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:45,840
to cooperate with them in order to achieve some objective and this sounds sort of like,

164
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,680
you know, trivial today but it was far from trivial back then, the ability to create worlds

165
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:01,320
that would accommodate many users. So MUD types of games were the first games

166
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,320
that created an internet type of experience for the users back then in the early 90s, many

167
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,000
people back then discovered what we call today the internet so a worldwide connected network

168
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,720
of computers through playing such kinds of games but because of you know bandwidth or

169
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,120
technology limitations these games were usually very limited in terms of their graphical interfaces.

170
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:37,920
Now, RPGs and MUDs came together and evolved into what today we would call MMORPGs or massively

171
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,360
multiplayer online the wrong playing games which are video games here we're talking now

172
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,240
about virtual worlds that have you know a very significant graphical interface sometimes

173
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:59,120
with a very high degree of photorealism and allow a massive number of players I mean I'm

174
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:10,680
talking in the range of even millions of players to play the game at the same time. Another

175
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,600
distinguishing characteristic of these games and this characteristic that is very important

176
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:24,360
for us is that these games feature what we would call persistent worlds, in other words

177
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:32,040
we're talking about games where if you as a player stop playing the game the game still

178
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,680
continues to exist, other players are there, the world evolves, things happen, so next time

179
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,880
you go back online you might find a very different environment because things have happened while

180
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,280
you were away and this is something that, okay for the younger people here that you know the

181
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:56,080
first types of games that they got used to were MMORPGs might sound like a natural thing but

182
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,440
for us it's a total revolution it was a total revolution because previous types of games

183
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,800
existed only as far as long as I was playing them the moment that I stopped playing the

184
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,400
game when you know I got offline or when I got the game over sign the game didn't exist

185
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,600
there the world stopped existing it came into existence and it stopped being there when

186
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,840
I entered and when I stopped playing the game. MMORPGs are the first example of persistent

187
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,560
worlds and as we will be discussing next week because persistence is a very important defining

188
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:44,280
characteristic of the metaverse, I would say that you know most early metaverses

189
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,400
is that we will say enjoying some type of real commercial success in the sense of having

190
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:58,600
many users in them will feature some sort of game-like persistence in the experience of

191
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:09,560
the users. Now these games have become hugely popular those of you that play such games

192
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:15,280
know that already for those of you that you know all these are new there are games like

193
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,600
World of Warcraft where the total player count of people that have accounts play that game are,

194
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,840
like you know, in the in the hundreds of millions and there might be more than a million people

195
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:35,520
playing the game at the same time around the world so we're talking about really really

196
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:43,200
popular really successful and mass-adopted games in the respective communities

197
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,280
and this has resulted naturally in gaming being a huge industry, I mean I come 

198
00:22:50,280 --> 00:23:01,960
from a blockchain and crypto type of background into this course so for me, the fact

199
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:09,800
that the whole crypto industry is worth around a trillion is, mind-blowingly

200
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,360
hugely successful but we're talking here about an industry in which the

201
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:23,320
number of cryptocurrency users are measured in the hundreds of thousands of millions

202
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,520
around the world, here we're talking about an industry in which almost half the world more

203
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:35,400
than 3.2 billion people worldwide play some sort of computer game, many of these people

204
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:46,880
play MMORPGs but not only that and there's a very aggressively growing e-sport industry

205
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:56,040
where the audiences have grown to more than half a billion people in 2022 so you think

206
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:04,040
about it, almost one in every two persons in the whole world are playing games and around one

207
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:12,120
in sixteen people are watching video games being played competitively by other players so this is

208
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:20,040
a huge industry and if it somehow makes the transition to Web3 it's going to be

209
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:28,440
a killer app for blockchains, for Web3 and for NFTs in general. The global gaming

210
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:34,920
market is projected to be worth more than 250 billion dollars by 2025 so we're talking about a huge

211
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:44,200
industry, there's console based marketplaces where you can get games like Nintendo,

212
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:52,280
PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox and stuff like that, a whole industry of course in mobile games, iOS,

213
00:24:52,280 --> 00:25:00,520
Google Play for Andriod and so on, a huge number of websites and a huge number of platforms

214
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:10,920
that provide access to gaming to desktop computers of which I think Steam is the largest, they support

215
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:21,240
around 70,000 gaming titles. The industry is huge and being dominated by players that come from all

216
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,360
backgrounds so you see technology companies like Microsoft, you see consumer electronics

217
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:38,840
companies like Sony, you see game studios like electronic cards and games like Rob

218
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:47,000
Blocks being in the top 10 of the gaming industry and you see the top 10 companies have

219
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:55,000
market caps that range from tens of billions of dollars to, okay Microsoft has a huge market

220
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,880
cap but it's not only gaming, so we're talking about a very very big industry that might make

221
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:10,120
the transition towards Web3 in the coming years. Now this was a very quick introduction

222
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:17,800
to the history of gaming and how we have arrived where we are today with NFT games but before

223
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:24,920
discussing this I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing game development. So

224
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:35,560
the games that you saw a couple of static images from in the previous slides like

225
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,360
world of Warcraft or Minecraft or similar types of games are very very complex competitive

226
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:51,160
projects to develop, they need huge teams of engineers, of artists, of designers and of

227
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:58,920
producers to be coordinated and to be able to create something that is not a one off thing,

228
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:05,400
it's not like a Hollywood movie where you might also need a similar type of

229
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,680
array of people coming together and coordinating themselves for a limited amount of time until

230
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:19,320
the movie gets out to theaters and then that's it, here we're talking about an ongoing process

231
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:27,000
of always improving, developing and evolving the game while the game is being played

232
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,120
and especially in the case of MMORPGs you need to be able to deploy

233
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,280
upgrades in real time while millions of people are using the product so we're talking about a very

234
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:49,320
complex and there go and I'm saying this because I want you and I want people like me

235
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:59,480
also to be a bit lenient when it comes to judging the gameplay, the design and the general

236
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:06,280
complexity and sophistication of blockchain-based games that we see around us because we're

237
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:14,520
trying to compare what huge companies with billions of dollars of market cap and thousands of employees

238
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:24,920
are able to produce after 10 or 15 years in the industry, with what a team of five

239
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:31,960
or ten start-upers might be doing in a whole new technology with whole new types of assets like

240
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,240
fans of the lot non-fungible tokens and sometimes I see reports saying, yeah but none of

241
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:46,440
these games are fun to play or sophisticated enough or whatever what do you expect did you

242
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:55,000
expect that you know a team of people that have just released a game that there's no

243
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,640
trodden path and there's no prior learning or whatever would be able to achieve anything close

244
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:12,440
to what a very sophisticated professional public company making billions of dollars is

245
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:24,040
producing, I mean, it's sort of expected that you would see the types of games that we see in the

246
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:29,080
in the blockchain and the crypto world today. So anyway, coming back to the team you would need

247
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:34,600
engineers obviously and not only people that would actually code and program the software but

248
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:39,400
especially when we're talking about console-based games, also people that would design and

249
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:49,000
manufacture and integrate the hardware on which the software will be running, you would need a huge

250
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,280
array of artists because you would need people that would define the concept, what is the game

251
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,920
vision of the storyline and everything, you would need people that would do the 3D modeling

252
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:05,080
of everything within the virtual world, the environment, the characters, the assets you would

253
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:13,960
need texture artists that would add textures and details to the 3D models created by the

254
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:20,200
modulus, you would need people that would spend their time working on lighting and motion capture

255
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:29,000
and sound and all these things. If you attended and watched the discussion of (Punk) 6529 

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:38,120
with Beeple the other day you might remember how much time and energy Beeple was

257
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,520
telling us that he was he's spending when he's creating his digital art, not in actual

258
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:53,400
modeling or customizing the models that he started working from but actually is sculpting or

259
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:01,960
photographing or playing with the lighting around these objects that he creates. So you will

260
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,800
need designers, you will need people to design the mechanics of the gameplay, to design the modalities

261
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,440
of player interaction and so forth and you need a production team that would actually bring

262
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,200
everything together would deal with this as a project with specific milestones and

263
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:26,040
deadlines and phases and what have you, and they was they would liaise with the business units

264
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:34,360
that would commercialize or market or sell the game, so we're talking about very big teams and

265
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:42,120
that's why sometimes we make distinctions between what we call indie and AAA games so there are

266
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,200
publishers that can afford having all these things and they are like they're the Hollywood type of

267
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,120
of actors in the gaming industry and there are indies so an indie game would be produced by an

268
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,080
independent studio or a small number of individuals and this is all the games in the blockchain

269
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:13,320
world, I guess. I spoke about mechanics so the mechanics of the gameplay is a very very important

270
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:20,760
thing because it defines all the rules and procedures that guide the player and they also dictate what

271
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:28,360
the game responses to the player's moves or actions can be; an interesting thought here is that

272
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:38,280
many/most of the games that we have today, in order to not confuse the player or not

273
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:47,960
create a steep learning curve for a new player, try to adhere to the laws of physics so you

274
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,360
know when you leave an object in the game it will fall down you know pulled by gravity as it would

275
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:02,120
in the physical world however, you understand of course that there is no reason for this to happen

276
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:11,480
in the digital world, we are free from all these constraints so in the metaverse sphere I would

277
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:22,440
expect that we would see some very original or experimental modalities regarding game mechanics

278
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:32,840
or world function mechanics where the world would not necessarily work as it does in the physical

279
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:40,280
world, so we might you know free ourselves from the limitations of the physical world in these environments.

280
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,000
Another important aspect is creating assets and here you would need to have access to

281
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:57,480
quite sophisticated software for 3D modeling either to create characters as you see in the picture

282
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,320
in the top of the screen which is I think from blender one of 

283
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:15,480
the open source types of software for 3D modeling all creating the details like the last

284
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,880
and best practices in the machine gun that you see in the image below which is from

285
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:31,480
a map software I think is from 3D Studio Mark so you would need to have all these things to create

286
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:40,200
assets and here I'm still talking about design and creating the assets you would need to enrich the

287
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:50,120
assets that come from your 3D modeling software and you usually start from some sort of mathematical

288
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,760
polygonal type of structure to create and add texture and details and lightning and stuff like

289
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:05,960
that on top of this and all this work is still to create the asset itself which could be part

290
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,440
of the virtual world, could be a playing character, it could be a non-playing character within a game,

291
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:23,880
it could be a weapon or a shield or a uniform or you name it, and has nothing to do with the actual

292
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,760
gameplay and ownership and transferability and where you would be able to find and how you would

293
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:38,200
be able to sell or swap or trade these types of assets, so the learning outcome here is that

294
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:46,680
creating a sophisticated competitive game is a very very competitive process. There are there 

295
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,160
a number of game engines so there are a number of software environments that can be used to

296
00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:01,960
allow game designers to bring everything together so 3D modeling gameplay mechanics as a creation

297
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:09,400
interaction between players and non-playing characters and so on, examples are the unreal engine

298
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:19,160
or unity or cryogen that you see here in this slide and there is also a huge body of work in

299
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:33,080
developing standardized libraries for APIs and software interfaces for either 3D graphics

300
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:42,840
processing hardware like your GPUs in your computer, like OpenGL and WebGL or more proprietary types

301
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,880
of APIs like DirectX by Microsoft for those that are programming games on Microsoft platforms.

302
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:56,200
Now having said all this and I understand that this is a very very

303
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:05,160
quick and shallow introduction to the technologies and processes around game creation

304
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,680
I would like to focus the remainder of our time on what we're interested in today, like

305
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,240
what happens when the technology of blockchain when cryptocurrency when fungible tokens and non-fungiable tokens (NFTs) 

306
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:25,640
meet gaming, how might we see the future of gaming through this

307
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:33,640
this lens and as I've said in the beginning I think that there are three major

308
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:49,320
types of implications that blockchain will have in gaming, blockchain being a technology that allows

309
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:58,440
for value creation storage and transfer over computer networks, I think it will have a substantial

310
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:06,520
effect on gaming because it will provide a much-needed layer for storing and transferring value

311
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:14,600
in gaming and I think there are three things there, one is asset ownership so who owns the assets

312
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:22,760
in a game, there's this famous story that Vitalik Butterin thought of a non-centralized Ethereum

313
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:32,680
when I don't remember which game he was playing but they deprived him of one of the weapons

314
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:42,600
or sheilds that he had managed to earn by playing the game and he realized that although

315
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:49,800
he thought that because this was in his inventory it was his it was actually not there was not, there's

316
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,320
no real ownership of your character, your avatar, your asset, your weaponry or whatever when you're

317
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:00,920
playing a game, everything is being controlled centrally by the game provider so if they want

318
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,360
they can throw you out of the game they can, 

319
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,240
block your account or they can

320
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:21,160
deprive you of any asset that you might have had so blockchain will change all that

321
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:28,280
because it would allow people to actually really own their assets that they use in the games and

322
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:36,200
when I say really own I mean they would have the ability to not only trade them with other users

323
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:45,240
but also do that and many other things outside of the game, so when you are when you have the asset

324
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:53,240
in your wallet as an NFT, you might use it in this particular game but the asset becomes also interoperable,

325
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:59,240
it can be used in other things so for example many of you have minted the course access token

326
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,000
for UNIC, this is a token that give you access to some of the material for the course and certainly

327
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:13,160
the exams so it's a token that helps utility within the ecosystem of this course but nothing

328
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:20,120
stops someone from creating some other experience which could be educational, a game or what have

329
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:29,240
you and have this experience token gated controlled and affected by the ownership of this token

330
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:36,040
so have created something that is accessible only by people who happen to have this asset on their

331
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:45,320
wallet so assets become more important than the games themselves, I don't know how many of you

332
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:55,240
are familiar with projects like Loot (for Adventurers) or the N Project in the NFT

333
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:03,480
space but both these projects and many others have flipped the idea of a game

334
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:12,520
on its head and they said why should we create a game and have assets only within this game

335
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:20,280
and not create the assets first, so create a set of weaponry and

336
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,400
shields and shoes and helmets and so on with different powers and different degrees of rarity

337
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:36,840
and aesthetics and so on and let everyone use the collection of these, this becomes an NFT

338
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:44,520
collection of assets in the games or arts or experiences that they create, so we're talking

339
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:54,440
about a wholly different perspective on how we view games if we have blockchain-enabled NFTs as

340
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:04,840
assets in them. And the final the effect of blockchain into gaming is the ability to create

341
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:11,800
in-game and sometimes (hopefully in the future) across game economies, so create whole economic

342
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:21,640
structures with supply and demand dynamics in which value is distributed to users and controlled

343
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:31,640
by the users within the game and not monopolized by the platform creating the game itself. So again

344
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:39,880
NFTs allow for true digital ownership for game assets so if you hold your character or

345
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:47,080
avatar as an NFT you are the real owner it cannot be taken away from you any asset that you buy

346
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:53,720
or you collect while playing the game can also be an NFT and then you can swap or trade with other

347
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,600
players without any intermediaries and without any possible censorship by the game owner and they

348
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:06,360
can also exist as I've said outside the game as independent entities that might have other

349
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:12,600
users or internal values so the collection of these four properties that you see in this slide

350
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:23,160
create a revolutionary, I would dare say, environment on how assets in games can be thought of that

351
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:29,640
was simply not possible in the pre-blockchain world even in the MMORPG era.

352
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:38,360
This has created a number of experiments, one of them that I'd like to spend a few minutes

353
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:46,600
discussing because it has received quite some attention by the community (at least the blockchain

354
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:55,320
community) is the so-called played-win games so as the names suggest these are games in which

355
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:05,080
the economics go to the next level because they allow their players to play the game for some sort

356
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:16,280
of a financial gain. Not in the sense of gaining from other players so like betting and battling

357
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,840
and whoever wins takes the money and wins the bet but in the sense of creating adding value,

358
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:30,280
creating new value that is created by playing the game itself. There are typically two broad

359
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:35,400
categories, those that are called "free-to-play" games, so you you can start playing the

360
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:42,280
game for free although if you do that you most probably will be limited in your ability to

361
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:49,800
to gain money from playing it, or, the so-called "pay-to-play" games in the sense that users will need to be

362
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,920
equipped by some sort of NFT so you would need to get an avatar or weapons or your shoes or whatever

363
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:02,120
so you need to buy NFTs you need to invest in the game in the beginning and once you've made

364
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:09,720
that investment, depending on how good you are in the game and how powerful or rare the properties

365
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:17,480
of your NFTs are, you might earn money usually in the form of some digital tokens which has fluctuating

366
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:27,000
value so whether these games would be able to create sustaining economies is a different

367
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,360
question that we're going to see in a while. Typically in such games players will be able to create

368
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:40,360
or breed new characters so you would be able to you know literally breed your characters and create

369
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:46,600
new ones that you can either use for playing or sell in the marketplace, you would be able to purchase

370
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:53,000
items either within the game or in third-party marketplaces and you would typically be able to

371
00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:00,520
unlock or earn additional digital assets or tokens by playing the game depending on how long

372
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:08,520
you played or how good you are at it and so on. The archetypal example here is actually infinity,

373
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:15,720
I'm not going to spend so much time on it because I think it's old news now but I don't

374
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:23,320
think any discussion about "play-to-earn" would be complete without discussing. Actually because it

375
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:29,400
was the first game that became hugely successful I mean at some point a year or a year and a half

376
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:36,840
ago there were lots of people, especially in countries like the Philippines where it was

377
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,440
extremely popular but were actually doing it as their job, they were making money by

378
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:50,680
playing the game. What is typical about Axie is that they pioneered this dual token structure so

379
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:58,840
these games usually have more than one type of tokens so they have both fungible and non-fungible

380
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:07,400
tokens and the fungible tokens usually are split between a governance token in the case of Axie

381
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Infinity it's the Axie Infinity Shard and the AXS token and a utility token in the case of Axie Gold Smooth

382
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:23,080
(I thought the small anyway smooth or small) love potion the SLP token which is the

383
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:32,200
reward token or the utility token that people would earn and there's also NFT tokens in the

384
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,800
the case of Axie the playing characters are NFTs the Axie themselves as well as tokenized lots of

385
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:47,480
land that act as forms or basis of operation for the activity. The game is about battling

386
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:55,880
with with other opponents your Axie against them so it's mostly a card-based game in which

387
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:04,680
players playing Terrence is not very interactive. There are a number of games that have been developed

388
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:11,720
following on the same or similar ideas. I have just some indicators examples here so Alien

389
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:20,120
Worlds or Galaxy Fight Club or Gods Unchained they are I would dare say and forgive me because it's a

390
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:27,880
very simplistic type of description and maybe unfair to them they are advanced versions of Axie

391
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:36,680
infinity in the sense that they follow a similar trajectory in terms of creating environments in

392
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:44,280
which characters fight or battle each other and players might make money if they

393
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:53,240
win against their opponents. A different Sam Zendre is the one in the bottom,

394
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:59,800
projects like Stepping or Genopets which are what we would call "move-to-earn"

395
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:10,040
games in the sense that they would reward users for their daily movements so the more that you

396
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:15,400
walk or run or in the case of Genopets is much more complicated because you have

397
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:22,360
this virtual pet so on top of banking steps you might do other things it's

398
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:30,920
more move-to-earm and plat-to-earm type of game but all of them (or most of them) have the same

399
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:37,880
basic underlying economic structure in the sense that there are a number of NFTs so in the Galaxy

400
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:45,480
Fight Club you have your fighter and you have weapons that this fighter is equipped to

401
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,960
and depending on you know what type of fighter or what type of weapon you might have different

402
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:59,480
abilities in battle and so the outcome of the game would be a combination of your skills combined with

403
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:06,840
the types of assets that you own. In the case of Stepping how much money you would make

404
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:14,600
would depend on a combination of factors like you what type of shoe you have (so this is an

405
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:24,920
NFT) what type of added properties you have equipped these shoe with and different shoes have different

406
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:32,200
properties and these properties have different values so for different uses there are different

407
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:42,120
optimal configurations of your shoes so quite complicated but at the same time this

408
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:51,720
complication might increase the joy or the satisfaction that users get

409
00:50:52,600 --> 00:51:01,480
by playing the game. So these types of games exist today but I would like to emphasize that we are

410
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:09,960
still extremely early in the NFT gaming phenomenon not only played one games but generally and

411
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:18,760
I said earlier that we sometimes tend to be unfair to the people that are creating these games

412
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:28,520
because we compare them with huge conglomerates that have been hugely successful

413
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:35,080
in monetizing Web2 types of games but these people are startups that are trying to redefine an industry

414
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:42,760
and it has proven to be very challenging to create a self-sustaining in-game economy. So as I've said

415
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,560
most of the projects are using a dual layer structure so both fudgeable tokens and NFTs

416
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:54,120
and a multi-tokens structure within its layer so you might have a governance and a utility token

417
00:51:54,120 --> 00:52:03,160
and multiple NFTs but I have yet to see a successful token economics mechanism so if you

418
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:10,840
if you witness most of the projects they follow a trajectory in which at least if their utility

419
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:19,400
token doesn't have enough utility it tends to fall in value because people would sell

420
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:27,080
it if they have nothing to do with it within the game and this of course creates a selling pressure

421
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:34,360
that combined with the infinite supply utility tokens that most projects would follow

422
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,160
will result a in a death spiral for the price of the token. It is interesting because

423
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:49,880
some analysts go as far as claiming that the play-to-earn movement itself is not sustainable

424
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:56,760
because giving monetary rewards may prove to be bad for player retention because it weakens the

425
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:02,680
the internal motivation that players would have at playing the game, I'm not sure I subscribe to this

426
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:09,800
line of thought I think there's a very huge incentive for people to play games for some

427
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:21,400
monitary gain and if we are true believers in our conviction that Web3

428
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:29,240
is about taking value from the platforms and giving it to the users then all these

429
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:35,720
billions that we discussed earlier, being made today by the gaming industry and being shared by a

430
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:45,000
small group of companies that control it, we will flow through to the end

431
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:54,760
users if and when we start finding self-sustainable economic models for that. A more

432
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,440
fair criticism is that most games today seem to emphasize the tokenomics that I discussed

433
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:07,640
earlier more than game design but we have to understand that for game design on blockchain we have

434
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:15,320
huge technical challenges which at the moment prevent us from creating 100% decentralized

435
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:22,120
games, remember the metaphor I used earlier, we are in the early days of the internet so as the first

436
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:29,880
popular games in the internet era where months there were games that allowed many people to play

437
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:36,920
together but they were text-based or storyboarded because you couldn't have sophisticated graphics

438
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,640
in the primitive internet infrastructure we have the same thing here, we have blockchains that are

439
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:51,160
very slow, transactions are public so you cannot have a real-time game, you cannot have game in

440
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:56,680
which if I do something and this something creates a transaction on the blockchain and this

441
00:54:56,680 --> 00:55:04,360
is published you know 12 seconds later in Ethereum then my character will wait for 12

442
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:11,080
seconds before it fires a bullet out of their weapon, this is a very bad user experience

443
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,920
so we need to solve these technical problems but I'm not worried about technical problems like it

444
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:24,360
happened in the early days of the internet and many people thought back then that this would be

445
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,120
the lack of speed or security or whatever would be something that would

446
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:35,880
condemn internet to oblivion and of course, it didn't happen, I am sure that the technical

447
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:43,400
challenges will be solved. In the meantime we will be looking at games that are only partially

448
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:50,520
decentralized and when I say partially I mean the characters, the avatars and the assets are

449
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:56,840
decentralized they exist on public blockchains and they are truly owned by the players but the

450
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:05,720
gameplay mechanics are still centralized and they happen on centralized servers. So concluding

451
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:15,480
this session I would like to just emphasize four points: Number one is that gaming is huge

452
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:23,560
and if gaming moves to blockchain and mass this will prove to be a killer application for

453
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:31,800
NFTs I know that with (Punk) 6529 you've discussed a lot about art and generative art and PFPs and

454
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:38,840
all these things and these are all fine applications but I think gaming is going to prove to be one

455
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:44,600
of the killer application of NFTs and of course PFP collections and even generative and stuff like

456
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:53,320
that has a huge role to play in gaming. The second takeaway is, I think that blockchain

457
00:56:54,040 --> 00:57:01,240
will act as the value layer in games providing three things, one is true ownership of assets by users,

458
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
number two interoperability of assets so the ability to move assets across games and, number

459
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,720
three, creating sustainable in-game and across-game economics. Take away number three, there are still

460
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:24,200
significant challenges to be overcome many of them are technological and design oriented, we still

461
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:33,480
haven't figured out ways in which we can move game mechanics to the blockchain and some challenges

462
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:40,120
are economic we still haven't managed to find the perfect balance between governance,

463
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:47,400
utility and non-fungible tokens to create a self-sustaining economy within a game.

464
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:55,960
Finally, keep in mind and we'll discuss this next week with (Punk) 6529 in more detail that games

465
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,760
can be thought of as early examples of metaverses and may

466
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,760
yet prove to be the application type through which most people will have their first

467
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:15,080
work-free exposure. As always we have some further reading for you and this concludes

468
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:25,240
the slides for this week. If you have questions let me move to Discord. I mean as usual, you can

469
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:33,080
see in the screen you can ask your questions in the OM Chat or on Twitter using the #NFTQnA

470
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:42,680
hashtag my colleagues will have probably already started feeding questions on Discord for me so

471
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:50,680
let me switch and see if I can find them there and I have my colleague Chris Christou from

472
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,240
the UNIC Virtual Reality Lab with me in case there are questions that are more technical

473
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:03,960
because as I said I don't come from a gaming background I might call him to join me in

474
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:15,160
answering them so let me see. So there's one question that says "is it actually sustainable

475
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:22,520
to release a token for a game that can be exchanged for fiat?" well that's a

476
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:33,480
million dollar question. It's certainly this is the case we have it is proven by the gaming

477
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:38,680
industry that people there's lots of people out there there's a big market for gaming so there's

478
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:44,760
lots of people that would actually be able to open their wallet and pay money to play a game,

479
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:53,560
they pay literally billions every year to play games. Whether this could translate into a sustainable

480
00:59:53,560 --> 01:00:03,720
mechanism through which money flows into an in-game economy in blockchain and allows that value

481
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:10,360
to be multiplied between the users of that economy and somehow shared between those that

482
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:18,520
create the game, those that play the game and those that provide the foundational infrastructure for

483
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:28,760
security and scalability so the underlying blockchain is something we

484
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:35,560
need to see how this could happen. I have to say that out of the examples that I showed you earlier

485
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:42,920
and all the others that I've seen in the NFT gaming space this hasn't happened yet and I think it

486
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:54,680
has happened for two reasons. One is that there hasn't been a game yet that would attract people

487
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:03,080
for the intrinsic motivation, there have not been games like Minecraft or Roblox or

488
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:09,160
the World of Warcraft or all the other games that have managed to create communities of millions of

489
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:15,240
people that want to play the game for the shear pleasure of playing the game and even pay to play

490
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:24,840
that game. Here we have mostly seen people that come in like "Kamikazes", getting into the game to

491
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:33,400
make a quick gain out of it and this mentality does not help the community of a very particular game

492
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:36,440
to create a lasting

493
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:45,400
with real life with games

494
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,400
games

495
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:58,120
option that is more organic and less important people that play the game because they like it and

496
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:04,760
they're not ready to leave it to go to the next game because they would make more money in the short term

497
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:16,200
out of it. I'm not saying it's not

498
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:19,400
I see myself

499
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,920
some sort of internet

500
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,560
let me know

501
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:34,280
okay sweet okay I will continue saying that

502
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,680
you know they will not do it

503
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:50,040
maybe it's a process some of the games that we've seen become useful for a

504
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:57,560
community or a longer amount of time like Axie Infinity or Stepping might make it

505
01:02:57,560 --> 01:03:04,280
but go through you know so what happened they went down now they will go up and find you know an

506
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:12,200
equilibrium but I think to answer your question that we will see games and we will see games very soon

507
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:23,560
that people would be willing to use their tokens inside the game and sell it outside the game for fiat

508
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:29,080
and there will be a thriving demand

509
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,760
and this is becoming the speed of blockchain transactions

510
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,760
I mean

511
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,760
yeah

512
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
question

513
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:52,280
blockchain scalability is a challenging thing I mean

514
01:03:53,800 --> 01:04:01,160
I've been in blockchain since the very beginning. Satoshi chose a 10-minute interval between

515
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:13,240
blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain because it wasn't possible to propagate transactions in the network

516
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:21,880
in a less amount of time so that all miners would know of the latest block

517
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:26,360
and we'll be able to start working on the next one when the previous one was mineg so

518
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:32,680
the Bitcoin blockchain had and still has a 10-minute interval between

519
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,440
between blocks

520
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,840
now moved to

521
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:54,440
my 12 intervals between blocks so in 10 years time because Bitcoin started in 2009, we're not

522
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:03,800
2022 so 13 years time we have gone from 10 minutes to 12 seconds and there are all sorts of solutions for

523
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:14,280
scaling that further and new technologies are coming all the time either for Layer 2s like optimistic roll-ups or

524
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:26,120
zero-knowledge snarks or other ways all for Layer 1s that have much much less demands in terms of

525
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:39,720
space or computing power or synchronization of nodes and so on so I'm sure that in the future

526
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:47,480
this problem will be solved but for the time being because games need near-instantaneous

527
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:56,520
type of reactions, when I have a shooting game and you fire the weapon it's the bullet to go

528
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,360
watch it its target of not hit it's targeting and do whatever it will do instantaneously I cannot

529
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:11,480
wait 12 seconds I cannot even wait two seconds for the experience would be detrimental so

530
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:22,680
my personal six times of game the first types of games will be becoming not going to be like

531
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:30,680
huge requirements in terms of speed that's why we're seeing you know card-based games in which players

532
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:36,920
play in terms so there's no real-time interaction we see the move to earn type of

533
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:38,840
standard you get

534
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:49,480
free for or stepping or whatever because these things do not have with and and real-time interaction

535
01:06:49,480 --> 01:07:01,640
requirements it will probably be a few years before we start seeing the migration of 

536
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:09,720
interactive games to the blockchain today. I have to wait until the holographic technology comes out and

537
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:17,240
then games will be the ultimate experience, that's very interesting and I think I will answer

538
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:26,600
this question then we can probably wrap this up. In the reader science world there have been two

539
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:34,840
technologies that (how can I say) invited radical of researchers at

540
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:41,800
indifferent points in time one was artificial intelligence that started in the late 60s with

541
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:49,880
lots of unfair and expectations never managed to deliver much until the

542
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:58,120
the discovery of Neural Networks and Deep Learning a few years ago and suddenly we have a

543
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:04,760
solution. The other technology is virtually everything that has to do with the virtualization of the reality

544
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:13,480
around us, either pure virtual reality or of managed reality has up to nowbeen more hype

545
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:24,040
than reality so to address the students comment I will say yes, I agree, if and when we see a holographic

546
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:37,400
technology come out or be too heavy and difficult to use and we'll not have

547
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:41,960
a huge latency and I will not get dizzy after using them for 10 minutes or whatever,

548
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:48,120
yes, there's huge potential for virtual long-term reality and also to be extremely

549
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:55,560
uh and this happened we'll discuss all these in a couple of weeks because we have a dedicated

550
01:08:55,560 --> 01:09:03,000
session in transiting visualization technology, I think Chris would have a lot to say then but

551
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:09,720
until the time that these technologies become really
552
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:23,160
let's say, come to go to standard in which they can be commercially deployed for the mass market

553
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:34,040
need some time so we'll see. Another question is "what incentive do current game designers have

554
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,400
to explore or adopt blockchain in their games, don't they currently benefit from their centralized

555
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:45,880
approach?" The answer is a clear yes but that has never stopped the world from progressing it's you know

556
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:53,240
heard this argument time and again and says "what incentive does Kodak have to

557
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:59,800
invest in digital photography, don't they profit from analog photography?" The answer is yes

558
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:06,120
they did profit but some competitors will disrupt them and will if they do not adapt to the new

559
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:13,480
technologies they will die so for the studios and the game designers and the big technology companies

560
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:20,280
that decide now it should be more to have a centralized approach I'm not looking at

561
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:25,880
blockchain as an alternative they might be lucky and blockchain never makes it but if it does

562
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:34,280
you know in 10 years' time many of the household names that we know today will be in history like

563
01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:43,480
Kodak or Fuji in the analog for those businesses and they will be substituted by others.

564
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:52,760
So, i think this concludes today's lecture, thank you very much for being with us, next week we'll

565
01:10:52,760 --> 01:11:08,680
have a (Punk)6529 discussing the Metaverse, thank you very much for being here and see you next week. Bye bye

566
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,400
you
