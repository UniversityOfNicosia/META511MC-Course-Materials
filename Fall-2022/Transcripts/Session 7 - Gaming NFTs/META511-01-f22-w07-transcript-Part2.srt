1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000


4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we have a very special guest,  

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000

Yat Siu, the chairman of Amimoca Brands. 

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yat welcome to the UNIC metaverse course 

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you for having me, great pleasure to be here. 

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So were going to go through our normal motive. Before i get to the hard questions about the future of the metaverse, 

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
i think for the benefit of our audience, 

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
can you first give us a little bit of your background and how that pathway 

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
ended up with you now been spending a lot of time in the NFT world. 

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sure. 

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
. 

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Generally speaking I think I'm a little older than the most of the people probably in the crowd. 

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm a child of a 70's, I grew up in Austria in Vienna, to a family of musicians 

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and so with this experience gave me a little of the experience of the world 

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of art and actually i had to study music myself as the an only Asian child you know in a Chinese excel of musician family. 

20
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:22,002
.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Everything you 've read about Asian ..  is all true. I was kind of forced to do that, but that gave me an appreciation of arts. 

22
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,002
.

23
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:42,000
I grew up in Austria and for those who remember Austria was sort of those country right at the edge, of sort of you know 

24
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:42,002
.

25
00:01:42,003 --> 00:01:45,000
was basic in eastern bloc countries, the soviet bloc 

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
as it was during the cold war era 

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and my mum used to work at the commercial post and she was in east Berlin, 

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
i would visit her and meet her i could saw how the communism was really look like, 

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and for those of us was a kind of eye opening in one hand, but you know 

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Austria was really a social democracy experience that 

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
and i wasn't very good compared to my peers at music for what i tried for, so I ended-up using a

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,120
computer in the 80s called the Atari ST to basically code on it,

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,040
to give me a slight edge in composition, actually

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,440
a pretty big edge, where I could basically compose music

40
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,720
through the computer.

41
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,400
And you have to remember that in the 80s,

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
that was still the time when it wasn't even

43
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,600
OK to use a calculator in school.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,920
So it's readily using a computer to help you make music.

45
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,800
It was definitely not cool.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
But I uploaded this piece of software

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,600
onto a pre-internet service called CompuServe.

48
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,060
And that was back in the day when people were using acoustic

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,560
operas and modems.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,880
And I uploaded this software, and I got appreciated for it.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,320
People started sending me checks in the mail

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,000
and, you know, keep doing a long story short.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,760
I ended up having got invited to take a job at Atari

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,920
to basically do precisely what I was doing as a hobby.

55
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,880
It kind of sort of moved me away from the world of music,

56
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,200
basically into the world of, I guess, tech or broadly

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,520
pre-internet type stuff, which to me

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,360
was really the precursor of, I guess,

59
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,480
what we now describe as a metaverse.

60
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,520
And I sort of fast-forward because I've had

61
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,440
in various careers where I basically

62
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,000
continued this entrepreneurial journey, eventually,

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,200
where I started one of Hong Kong's very first internet service

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,440
providers in 1993 or so, which is very early.

65
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,960
And it was even that was one of the browsers

66
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,400
we actually ended up using was Mosaic,

67
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,720
so even just pre-net-scared.

68
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,760
So super, super early.

69
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,320
And one of the first products that we were working on

70
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,960
was VRML, which was basically a VR version of HTML.

71
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,040
So it was obviously that didn't work out.

72
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,760
But it got us involved in the world of SGI and so on.

73
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,920
Anyway, so much of the software we're using

74
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,320
was all open source because we didn't have much cash.

75
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,520
Then we were first working on net BSD

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,920
and then eventually moved over to Linux, which then sort

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,600
of evolved into creating basically a company called

78
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Outplace, which was a company that

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
became one of the very first cloud computing businesses.

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,640
It used to be called ASP in 1998 to 2000.

81
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,960
So experience.com boom and bust, right?

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,600
Built a business that eventually was

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,840
acquired by IBM some years later to basically become

84
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,640
sort of the cloud computing lab here in Asia.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
Under Lotus Notes, that's we built one of the biggest

86
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,960
email companies in the region.

87
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,480
But we also power a lot of US companies.

88
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,240
And that was built entirely on Linux.

89
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,680
And again, big, big, big era and open source and so on.

90
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Because we had a non-computer enterprise

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,160
and because IBM doesn't like to acquire companies

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
with founders, so they acquired the business for cash flow

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,600
and growth, but they don't like the founders,

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,040
I had a two-year transition period.

95
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,960
And then I basically went into sort of a little bit

96
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,840
back into the entertainment media route

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,920
into mobile gaming because I had a smartphone

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,200
and I saw the opportunity there because I was a young father

99
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,440
and really sort of had our team build children's applications

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,400
that became very popular and then sort of realized

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,840
the potential of the smartphone, went into mobile games.

102
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,080
And that was sort of my first, I guess, big experience of what

103
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,360
happened to the web because everything we're building

104
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,080
was open source.

105
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
And then when we were building on the App Store,

106
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,720
we actually were one of the biggest gaming developers

107
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,000
on the App Store between 2011 and early 2012.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,480
And then in early 2012, mysteriously, well,

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,680
not so mysteriously, I guess, all of our apps

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,760
were deleted from the App Store for apparent violation

111
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,320
of App Store rules.

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
And that was kind of a shock because we didn't think

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,200
we broke any rules, but the problem was

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,880
we were based in Hong Kong at the time.

115
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,200
I had employed at that point, something like 160 people.

116
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,040
We were having, it was a reasonably sized gaming business

117
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,320
before its time, having millions of customers.

118
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,360
And you'll find articles on the web

119
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
about the sudden disappearance of our apps

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,520
and the mystery around it.

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,760
And we were deplatformed because some people at the time

122
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,520
when Apple was sort of a cappuccino

123
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,320
didn't call us, didn't tell anyone.

124
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,440
They just said, you know what, we don't like you for,

125
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,160
I guess, what apparently was our marketing practices,

126
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,880
but we never got to speak to anyone.

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,640
So we never really knew what happened.

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,080
I took several years to get back into the App Store.

129
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,480
But that was sort of our first big experience

130
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,960
in terms of what happened in terms of open source,

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
web one to web two centralization.

132
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
And sort of struggled a little bit as a game developer

133
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
thereafter because we couldn't come back

134
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,560
in the platform for almost two years.

135
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,040
Then fast forward, we owned the studio in Canada

136
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,440
called Fuel Powered that basically shared an office

137
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,960
with another company in Vancouver called Axiom Zen.

138
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,040
And for those of you who know a little bit about the history,

139
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,880
Axiom Zen was a creator of cryptocurrencies,

140
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
which eventually led to the creation of Dapper Labs.

141
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,160
And the co-founder of this company called Fuel Powered

142
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,200
that we owned became ultimately a co-founder of Dapper Labs

143
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,440
together with others.

144
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
And we became an early investor at Dapper Labs

145
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,120
and it's the publisher of Cryptocities in our region.

146
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,280
When we saw that we were really fascinated

147
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,640
with what non-fungible tokens could truly represent

148
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
as digital ownership.

149
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,680
What wasn't described as a metaverse back then,

150
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,400
but really in terms of virtual societies

151
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,560
and in terms of the gaming universe.

152
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,840
And I think we weren't the classic crypto og's

153
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,800
as in we didn't enter the world of blockchain

154
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,920
because of Bitcoin or because of an Ethereum ICO.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,200
In fact, none of that interested us

156
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,080
because we were very financial in nature.

157
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,280
But when we saw NFTs that fascinated us

158
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,720
because of the fact that the business model

159
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,840
of Cryptocities early as it was also put the control

160
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,520
of the manufacturing of those digital cats

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,920
entirely in the hands of the users,

162
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,440
which was also a very powerful concept,

163
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,640
which in the traditional gaming world

164
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,880
was never seen before.

165
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,560
So all of these things led us to this point

166
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,640
and sort of fast forward.

167
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,360
And this was in late 2017, in 2018

168
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
we built such conviction.

169
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,160
And it was a really bad time in crypto, if you may recall.

170
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,720
Bitcoin was like $3,000 and Ethereum was floating

171
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
in the low hundreds, right?

172
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,200
That's actually when we built our biggest conviction,

173
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,640
perhaps not having been burned by any previous experiences.

174
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
We just went all in and we started to not only build

175
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,000
our own experiences, we acquired a small gaming company

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,040
back then called Pixel that was building

177
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,480
something called the Sandbox for instance

178
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
and helped them basically grow their business.

179
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,400
We were early investors in 2018-2019 companies

180
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,840
like Sky Davis with the creators of Max Infinity

181
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,840
and OpenSea and of course Dapper Labs and Wax

182
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,920
and Decentraland.

183
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:43,160
And today over 380 companies that we both invested

184
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,880
and supported and also helped build over the course

185
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,680
of the last, almost five years now.

186
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,640
So yeah, so that's a little bit of the origin story

187
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,480
and how we got into it.

188
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,600
And maybe I'll close a little bit in terms of

189
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,680
how we feel about this space, we talk a lot about

190
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,800
true digital ownership or digital property rights

191
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
as we see it as the foundation of what we think

192
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,480
is a metaberson.

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,560
That's basically our mission.

194
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,080
And the background, in terms of my background

195
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,120
having grown up in Europe with a certain kind

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,200
of political system, having experienced also,

197
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,160
I guess what used to be called Eastern Europe,

198
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,960
then having worked in America, which gave me

199
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,840
sort of a perspective of capitalism

200
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,240
that was frankly a big culture shock.

201
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,680
And then I came to Hong Kong, for those of you

202
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,920
who know anything about Hong Kong,

203
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,840
that's like capitalism Uber drive.

204
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,960
It's even more capitalist if you will.

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,440
Totally free markets, right?

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
And those were sort of these perspectives

207
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,760
all helped shape some of our thinking over time

208
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,560
as to the opportunity and the perspectives

209
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,720
as we see the opportunity for this open metaberson

210
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
and digital ownership.

211
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,720
Wow, that's an incredible origin story.

212
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,840
I mean, you've been through a lot of the iterations

213
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,840
of the internet, pre-internet, which is very interesting.

214
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,840
But let's talk about Animoca as it is now.

215
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Ooh, because, you know, it does a lot of things.

216
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
And in some areas, I think it's more active

217
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,480
in the other areas, it's more passive investor.

218
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,240
And there's, I think, some pre-blockchain gaming

219
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,480
in there as well and then also blockchain gaming.

220
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Can you give us a sense of how the company's structured,

221
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,400
what the important parts are now

222
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
from a quantitative perspective,

223
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
what the strategy is going forward?

224
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
How much do we think of it as an operating company

225
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,640
versus a holding company or something like a fund?

226
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,160
Give us your vision for Animoca.

227
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,560
So first off, it is absolutely an operating business.

228
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,240
So we didn't start up as a fund

229
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,000
and while we are now looking at potential fund options,

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,880
that wasn't really sort of how we were set up,

231
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,240
which is very different from a classical perspective.

232
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,480
Because we've been so prolific in our investing,

233
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,160
we often get sort of rated alongside other VC firms

234
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,280
like A60Z, but we're not that type of firm, right?

235
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,800
Like for instance, when we made the investment in OpenSea,

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,760
we did it because we wanted to help grow the NFT space

237
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,800
and also sell our NFTs that were from instance like Sandbox,

238
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,640
on OpenSea, right?

239
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,400
So we looked at it as a strategic perspective

240
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,120
rather than purely from an investment return perspective,

241
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,400
but it also gives us a very long-term lens.

242
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,280
But I think there's a few things that come into the thinking.

243
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,320
The first thinking was around sort of

244
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,840
what is building on chain really mean,

245
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,120
before we had even coined or sort of thought of

246
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,520
but sort of before the term,

247
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,400
I mean, Web3 has come about,

248
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,000
which is really sort of that if you're building on chain,

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,080
then you can share in its network effect,

250
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,640
but you can share the benefits of the general growth

251
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,000
of an ecosystem much like an economy, right?

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,440
So that means that, and if this is to be open

253
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,960
and kind of like what the true promise of the original internet was,

254
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,920
like for instance, with open source and sort of open information,

255
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
then we can monopolize this.

256
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,800
It doesn't work in a monopoly way as Web2 has evolved.

257
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
So that means it's better for us to sort of facilitate the growth

258
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,040
of the ecosystem through to this ethos of decentralization

259
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,520
by having minority stakes in many players as well

260
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,560
to help fuel it, right?

261
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,840
It wouldn't help if we say, for instance, own open sequences.

262
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,800
That doesn't really work, we think.

263
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,240
But if we become sort of an early investor

264
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,120
and we sort of funnel the many of our early NFT projects

265
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,080
into open C to help it fuel its growth,

266
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,960
while sharing it in its success,

267
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,800
then there's going to be a mutual benefit

268
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,120
across the ecosystem as we see it.

269
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,840
And so that's a big belief that we had.

270
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,160
So we ended up investing very broadly.

271
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,720
And it comes a little bit on sort of the heels of

272
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,000
looking back because I draw a lot of parallels

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
between the evolution of Web1 and Web3,

274
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,520
say, well, the early internet evolved a certain way.

275
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,640
And I think Web3, which is sort of obviously

276
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,240
the better version of the internet in the future as we see it,

277
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,280
revolves in similar patterns.

278
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,760
What would I have done in hindsight?

279
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,800
To me, what I'm seeing with Web3 is almost like having the benefit

280
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,560
of going back into the future, right?

281
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,360
And then sort of being able to sort of see what would I do?

282
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,800
Well, I would probably invest in many of these companies

283
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,320
as well.

284
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,440
If I had a chance to invest in Amazon or invest in Facebook,

285
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,280
perhaps, or invest in Google and those companies

286
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,800
in the early days as I'm building my own business,

287
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,440
then we can create a healthier ecosystem as opposed

288
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,640
to one that is built around sort of trying to sort of obtain

289
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,680
zero-sum outcomes because we would

290
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
have sort of influential stakes in this.

291
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,200
I mean, it's almost like if SoftBank was investing

292
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,640
with the purpose as opposed to just for money,

293
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,080
what would the internet look like, for instance?

294
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,000
Because they had stakes in many of the early companies

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,200
that had a potential influencing factor.

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,880
But because they generally only cared about returns,

297
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,800
it was only simply about maximizing it.

298
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,160
But actually, there is a kind of forced power

299
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,560
that comes into having sort of capital value attached

300
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
to some form of sort of positive influence

301
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,680
that you can create, right?

302
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,120
So that's kind of how we looked at it.

303
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,040
And so therefore, investing in many of these companies

304
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
became part of the strategy of Animal Care Brands.

305
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,320
And where it almost appeared to some people who looked at us

306
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,040
and said, aren't you like a metaverse index fund?

307
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,120
Well, no, we're not.

308
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,280
But it could be translated this way

309
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,600
because we consistently, even during this time,

310
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,840
are investing in companies that help fuel this.

311
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,800
And it also means that from an investing perspective,

312
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,560
we don't need to look at a return solely

313
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,320
on the returns of the company we invested.

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,000
As a fund, you need to make sure that every investment

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,720
has a return on the one company you've done.

316
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,920
And if it doesn't have like a 100x or 20x or 30x return,

317
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,960
then maybe it's not worth it, regardless of it maybe

318
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,760
being very good for the ecosystem,

319
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,040
because that's not only a mandate.

320
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,080
But in our case, we can make investments.

321
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,320
For instance, we have probably close to 20 guild investments.

322
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,160
And you would say guilds aren't necessarily

323
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,040
the best kind of investment, right?

324
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,120
Because it's a fairly low barrier to entry.

325
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
But what guilds do do is that they

326
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,760
train people about the metaverse.

327
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,520
They bring people onto Web3 games.

328
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,800
They recruit them, right?

329
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,680
They do all this stuff.

330
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,880
And they also invest in these gaming assets

331
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,080
and help people in the gaming sort of Web3 world

332
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,520
to sort of learn about blockchain games,

333
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,280
or bring Web2 gamers onto Web3, for instance.

334
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:23,760
So even if they don't return in terms of the equity investment,

335
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,120
they would probably create sufficient economic return

336
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,240
in terms of the flow of capital going

337
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
through all of our portfolios and our companies,

338
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,320
like for instance, buying assets, or bringing in gamers,

339
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,840
or creating more adoption, that it actually

340
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,000
becomes valuable for the entire ecosystem as a whole.

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,720
And the only way to do this is to have a broad sort of exposure

342
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,600
to the ecosystem on top of building, right?

343
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,760
And then we have the projects that we're building ourselves,

344
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,680
whether it's the sandbox, the pandemic, the galaxies,

345
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,040
or the racing, or for instance, most recently,

346
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,440
the tiny tap, which is basically sort of education,

347
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,240
and NFTs, and digital ownership in that area.

348
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,720
As areas that we think that we have core expertise

349
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,800
that we can help build and develop.

350
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,840
We're about 1,000 people today worldwide.

351
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:14,120
We have something close to 25 sort of subsidiaries,

352
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,560
or wholly owned groups, which companies like Sandbox

353
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,040
would fall under, and over 380 sort of separate investments.

354
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,800
And obviously, as we've grown so much,

355
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,560
trying to sort of create sort of partnerships

356
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,040
between them becomes more challenging.

357
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,440
But one of the big benefits of Web3

358
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,120
is that it's actually very natural to do so

359
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,080
because of the fact that it's permissionless.

360
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,160
Like, you don't need to have an agreement with OpenSea

361
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,720
to basically sell the assets on OpenSea, for instance.

362
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,680
Nor do you need to have an agreement with Hugo Labs,

363
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,920
for instance, to be using someone's board aid

364
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,200
from a sort of let's call it licensing perspective,

365
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,960
because it's already embedded within the license rights

366
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,040
of perhaps only that NFT, or certainly Hugo would agree that,

367
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,880
right?

368
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,000
So you can actually have already a sort of

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,240
call it a cooperative methods without opening up an API,

370
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,480
creating a contract, right?

371
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
Web2 companies have a very hard time creating, you know,

372
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,120
sort of this sort of overused word synergies, right?

373
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,040
But in Web3, it's much more natural to do so

374
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,360
because it's all on chain and it's all permissionless.

375
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,520
And so we see this effect happening very naturally.

376
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Therefore, we feel that the broader the space grows,

377
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,840
actually the more network effects the crew,

378
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:25,160
one of the big thesis points we have on digital property rights

379
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,000
is the fact that, you know, these network effects

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,360
basically can compound on top of each other.

381
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,920
But they can compound on top of each other

382
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,120
if there's only one platform, right?

383
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,720
But, you know, the diversity of this is the fact that

384
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,280
hopefully thousands and thousands of platforms

385
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,720
start to sort of create different type of network effects

386
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,240
on top of our digital ownership,

387
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,200
which is why we invested in things like NFT lending platforms

388
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,240
or layer one or layer two blockchains

389
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
on top of, you know, gaming assets or guilds basically,

390
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,120
or, you know, brands that basically onboard users

391
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
onto the metaverse, right?

392
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,280
All of these are effectively adding to the network effects

393
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,880
of digital ownership in one form or the other.

394
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,880
So which of all these things are your main operating activities?

395
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,080
What are the big ones?

396
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,400
Well, I mean, we think of ourselves as splitting ourselves

397
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
50, 50 in terms of the investment activity,

398
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,920
because obviously, especially during the bull run,

399
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,800
you know, that part of the portfolio ended up just exploding.

400
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,840
But, you know, we, again, that was more sort of,

401
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,600
I guess, half a sense of the market.

402
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,920
But of course, one of the major ones was, is of course, Sandbox,

403
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
right?

404
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,640
And Sandbox is probably our most famous sort of subsidiary asset

405
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,800
in terms of operating income.

406
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
But then the other things, for instance,

407
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,160
that we do sort of our involvement, for instance,

408
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,080
in partnership, they have, for instance, with YUDA,

409
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
are involved with Bitcoin that we basically

410
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
were a launch contributor.

411
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,400
And the fact that we would sort of receive basically

412
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,600
sort of, you know, part of the launch contribution tokens

413
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,080
and helping sort of assist in the launch of the other deed,

414
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
for instance, is a part of our operating activity.

415
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,080
These are not our investment activity.

416
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,160
But on top of that, we've also made an investment in YUDA

417
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
itself as well as an investor.

418
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,360
So we have a dual role in this one

419
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,960
where we are both an operating partner, making games,

420
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,080
for instance, or sort of helping launch NFTs, for instance,

421
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,320
or sort of assets, while we're also investing, right?

422
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,480
So these would be examples of that.

423
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,240
And, you know, Sandbox is probably most well-known,

424
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,000
but obviously the work that we do with, you know,

425
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,360
with you guys, critically important,

426
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,440
most recently also the work that we do with CoolCats,

427
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,200
we think is going to be pretty cool.

428
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,840
No pun intended here, right?

429
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,560
And then, of course, the other area

430
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,840
on that we are putting a lot of emphasis on

431
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,160
in terms of growth is Phantom Galaxy.

432
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,280
This is probably the very first web 3 AAA game

433
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,360
that actually has a playable game that you can do right now.

434
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,120
And that's a big area of development that's sort of ongoing.

435
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,200
And of course, we're very, very excited about new areas

436
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,040
of what digital property rights can deliver,

437
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
like what we did with TinyTap.

438
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,880
You know, this is part of our model.

439
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,120
When we acquired TinyTap,

440
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,840
just like when we acquired Sandbox,

441
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,240
this was an existing web 2 business.

442
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,040
All right, it didn't start from nothing, right?

443
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,120
And then we used it as a foundation

444
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,920
to bring customers in the web 2 paradigm

445
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,880
that they're in into web 3.

446
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,800
And there's a business that already has revenue

447
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,040
and therefore is sustainable as a business.

448
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,280
And therefore, you know, when we add sort of the property rights

449
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,800
and the network effects that can be impossible

450
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,840
with digital property rights,

451
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,720
we actually amplify that business, right?

452
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,480
And so that's part of our operating procedure,

453
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,960
in part because we understand, you know,

454
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,160
I guess traditional gaming and the web 2 world.

455
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:37,720
And obviously, I've grown a better understanding

456
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,960
in how to build web 3 products and services.

457
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
We're still learning, of course.

458
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,400
But I guess it's all relative

459
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,120
because the NFT space is relatively young.

460
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,640
So even four or five years of experience

461
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,360
might be considered fairly experienced in this world.

462
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,040
Okay, there's many, many different things you just said.

463
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,080
And so I'm gonna try and break them up

464
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,160
so we can talk about them

465
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,080
because they're all very interesting.

466
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,520
Tell us first about Sandbox.

467
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,680
So Sandbox is, I think it calls it something

468
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
a reverse, discipline something a reverse.

469
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,920
Yeah, it's an open metaverse.

470
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,160
Yep.

471
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,520
So what does that mean?

472
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,400
What is it trying to accomplish?

473
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,440
What approach should open?

474
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
What approach should not open?

475
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,040
How should we open the meta?

476
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,680
So the Sandbox, the inspiration of Sandbox really,

477
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,840
you could say, is sort of Minecraft on blockchain.

478
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,120
One of the reasons why it's voxel and style was intentional

479
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,560
is because voxels is one that everyone can participate in.

480
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,440
You can create awesome constructions

481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,800
without having to have sort of, you know,

482
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,120
3D talent and sort of, you know,

483
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
the onboarding is quite straightforward.

484
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,680
One thing that most people who are not in the gaming space

485
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
don't fully recognize or realize

486
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,960
is that the two biggest games in the world

487
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,280
are Roblox and Minecraft.

488
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,400
And so this kind of game environment,

489
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,640
I think is very suitable because both of them

490
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,240
have already embodied a sort of let's call it

491
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,440
pre-web three quasi-narrative.

492
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,120
In the case of Minecraft, it's open source.

493
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,760
Minecraft itself has an ecosystem

494
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
that is actually fairly decentralized,

495
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,160
not because of the licensing structure of Minecraft,

496
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,480
because of the fact that, you know,

497
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,760
you could run a Minecraft server

498
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,160
or you could do mods or you could do all these type of things.

499
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,680
And that basically creating an ecosystem

500
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,880
that is what's keeping Minecraft alive

501
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,040
and actually thriving as opposed to a centralized approach

502
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,760
where, you know, in this case,

503
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,440
Microsoft would be responsible for all activities

504
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,520
and growth in Minecraft, which is not the case,

505
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,120
you know, in very much so in Minecraft,

506
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,280
it's a community that is continuing to build on top of it.

507
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,440
Roblox is similar, but with a slightly different concept.

508
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,200
It's more central, it's actually centralized,

509
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,960
but you're building new game experiences within Roblox

510
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,640
and building new sort of echo,

511
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,320
it's sort of pre-menversus experiences for players to experience.

512
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,360
So Sandbox is essentially doing the same thing

513
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,280
with one big difference,

514
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,240
which is that you have ownership of these assets,

515
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,520
you own the NFTs outright,

516
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,640
you can do whatever you want with them,

517
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
you have the freedom to transact as you love to say, right?

518
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,880
Which means that, you know,

519
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,400
we have no problem with you taking the asset

520
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
and doing something else with it, for instance, right?

521
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,640
But of course, Sandbox itself has a limited supply of land.

522
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
People are developing on it for experiential reasons.

523
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,880
Right now, one of the main reasons

524
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
why you'd want to build on Sandbox

525
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,040
is because most landowners have an asset value

526
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,600
in their wallets somewhere between half and million

527
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,080
to $2 million, which is fairly substantial,

528
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,600
which means that you are able to target a certain kind of audience.

529
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,640
So in a way, Sandbox has become kind of like,

530
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,320
I don't know, Fifth Avenue, if you will, right?

531
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,640
Or Landmark or whatever,

532
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,880
sort of big, big, big major district you want to think of

533
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,880
because of its concentration of a certain kind of audience,

534
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,720
which is why big brands, whether it's Gucci or Adidas

535
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,080
or Snoop Dogg or whatever,

536
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,360
are launching sort of experiences on there.

537
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,440
It's also virtual land is something, again,

538
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,840
from an onboarding standpoint,

539
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,360
much more easily understood in terms of what it means

540
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,880
because you understand property rights in the form of land

541
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,040
more clearly than property rights in the form of other things

542
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,400
because it feels a little bit more sort of elusive

543
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,120
even though you have rights attached to it.

544
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,920
Most people don't think deeply behind it.

545
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,440
But if you own a piece of land or you own your house,

546
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,480
then you more clearly think of it as property rights

547
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,520
and it's an easy translation to that.

548
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,640
How you think of the Metabras in Sandboxes,

549
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,080
that people are building experiences

550
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,800
that they can branch out from within the Sandbox.

551
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,000
So the South China Morning calls,

552
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,200
recreated Hong Kong's harbor as a way to preserve its history

553
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,640
in the Metabras, for instance.

554
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,680
Snoop Dogg famously built his mansion

555
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,160
and then he sold sort of his collection,

556
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,720
the doggies, there's a way sort of for access and membership.

557
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,120
So it's like a, you can think of this almost like building

558
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,120
a sort of a national economy of a small scale,

559
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,560
right, that might today have the economic output

560
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,920
of a small island nation powered by the sand token,

561
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,040
which is basically sort of, you could call it

562
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,120
its sort of utility token.

563
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,920
And of course the land itself,

564
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,800
which is what you need to have to build on top of it.

565
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,560
And we think of this as, from the ethos standpoint,

566
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,600
is very open, you can build whatever you want on it,

567
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,520
it is yours and you're free to move it somewhere else.

568
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,800
I mean, meaning that if someone wanted to potentially

569
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,440
do a vampiric attack on Sandbox

570
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,760
and recreate Sandbox too, but what they think

571
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,160
is a better version, then they're free to do so.

572
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,360
It's nothing restricting them from doing that.

573
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,760
And of course the assets can be traded

574
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,480
on all the various marketplaces.

575
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:28,040
How many people own a piece of land in Sandbox

576
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,960
or how many addresses have this set?

577
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,000
So there's about 250,000 active players

578
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and the actual land owners is probably somewhere between,

579
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,080
I think it's 13 to 15,000 people, something like that.

580
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,040
And what's an active player in the Scumps?

581
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,160
Someone who basically engages at least once a month

582
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,060
in the Sandbox.

583
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,720
And one of the extremely great criticisms

584
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,080
of blockchain based whatever is this way,

585
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,640
and actually quite anything that's metaverse

586
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,320
is that the daily numbers, daily user numbers

587
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,840
are quite low relative to web2-related

588
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,120
and its purposes are traditional gaming.

589
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:12,960
Yes.

590
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,040
What's your response to that?

591
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,160
Well, I think the point on this one is that first,

592
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
and we can maybe later on talk a little bit

593
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,320
about the economics of gaming as an example,

594
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,920
is that the people who actually are engaged

595
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,920
in these environments are almost equivalent of paid users.

596
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,560
So 250,000 users in a web3 game

597
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,320
has far more economic output

598
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:38,320
than even I would argue 10 million gamers in a regular game.

599
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
So I'll get to that shortly.

600
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,960
So that's one thing.

601
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,640
And the way that one should measure the economic impact

602
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,080
of Sandbox is more than that of a GDP.

603
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,840
So imagine if you had 250,000 people in a village

604
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,600
of some sort or a city in this case, right?

605
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,760
Probably village in China, but maybe a city in Europe, right?

606
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,320
You would be able to sort of measure some kind

607
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,880
of economic output of its value.

608
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,760
And because there is ownership and there's transactions

609
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,120
and there's commerce that takes place, digital as it may be,

610
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,920
you have value that comes far deeper

611
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,680
than just someone who has a one-sided fake transaction

612
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,040
in this case in form of a game.

613
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,720
So the value of a user in the web2 game is, you know,

614
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,040
cents on the dollar, if anything like that.

615
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,160
Whereas a transactional value, a commercial value

616
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,320
of a web3 user is closer to, let's call it

617
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
like a low GDP country, for instance.

618
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
So there were thousands of dollars to you as supposed

619
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,800
to worth, you know, 50 cents or 20 cents.

620
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,440
So that means if you have a few hundred thousand players

621
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,360
in an ecosystem like that, which is also what you see

622
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,960
in other web3 games like say, Axie Infinity,

623
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,840
it will drive millions and millions of dollars

624
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,200
of revenue and value because each user basically has more

625
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,040
economic activity as they do in the context of, you know,

626
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,840
I guess real value.

627
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,680
In the web2 gaming world, what most people don't appreciate

628
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:05,000
is that somewhere between 97 to 99% of all gamers don't pay.

629
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,600
But it does drive, the entire gaming industry is a $200

630
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,840
billion industry of which the majority comes from what's known

631
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
as free-to-play gaming.

632
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,360
But that free-to-play gaming comes only from the conversion

633
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,000
of a low single digit percentage of users.

634
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,760
For all of you here who play games,

635
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,000
you might ask us a question, what was the last time you paid

636
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,440
for the game that you played?

637
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,800
Or if you ask your friends who play games, how often do they pay?

638
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,240
And it turns out, you know, actually I think the industry

639
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,720
average is more like 1.5 to 1.75%, so it's very small.

640
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,280
But they fuel that, right?

641
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:39,640
And what happens is that in web3, you could say effectively,

642
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:42,840
every gamer is an economic participant of some sort.

643
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,320
And therefore, you know, 10 million users in a web2 game

644
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,000
might not even have the same economic output as 100,000

645
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,040
web3 games, because you would translate it backwards

646
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,800
in terms of conversion.

647
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,680
And then the conversion numbers in terms of value

648
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,480
is very different, right?

649
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,680
If you buy a piece of land, or if you buy NFT assets

650
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,840
in a game, your average R-proof player

651
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,000
is paid R-proof is far, far higher than it would be in a web2

652
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,680
game.

653
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,040
So therefore, small user numbers aren't a problem.

654
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,960
In fact, I foresee a future part of the reasons why

655
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,120
we invest so prolifically, that because of these unit

656
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,200
economics, you can have far more sustainable web3 games,

657
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,080
because you don't need to appeal to a game that

658
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,440
must have 10 million users to be successful.

659
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,240
In the traditional gaming world, if you have 10 million users,

660
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
you're a ho-hum, right?

661
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,440
If you're in just a couple million users range,

662
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,320
that's considered generally a failure,

663
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,080
because you can only monetize users in sort of very low

664
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:41,600
value.

665
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,280
You can't be sustainable, right?

666
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:46,560
But in a web3 game, if you have 100,000 users,

667
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,960
which are, I guess, similar to this concept of your true fans,

668
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,240
who will have strong economic activity,

669
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,600
you can sustain thousands of games more easily, which is better.

670
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,920
Indie game developers today are constantly struggling,

671
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,400
and many of them are dying, because they can succeed,

672
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,520
because their unit economics don't work,

673
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,960
partially because of the platform, because of the fees involved,

674
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,160
but also because of the fact that they

675
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,640
have to, in this business model, get to a huge size in order

676
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,520
to even just be break-even, which is really hard.

677
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,640
And that's the weakness of a web2 versus a web3

678
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
versus model.

679
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,720
But, sorry, because there's something

680
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,760
that I didn't understand.

681
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,760
Obviously, the landowners, the 13 to 15,000,

682
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,040
have spent a lot of money for their land.

683
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,480
That's much more than any, I think,

684
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,960
gamer would typically spend on their game.

685
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,520
Are you saying the GDP is driven off that,

686
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,920
or because the other 250,000 monthly users who

687
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,680
are not about land owners, what are they?

688
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Oh, yes.

689
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,840
So for instance, yeah, so if they're buying, for instance,

690
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,840
NFTs to participate in sort of, not every person who

691
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,680
wants a doggy and Snoop Dogg is a landowner,

692
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,200
but he wants to participate in basically Snoop Dogg's

693
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,920
experience in his mansion, so then he

694
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,560
would have this NFT, for instance.

695
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,160
Or, for instance, with all of Xs,

696
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,120
they sell fitness NFTs, and so you

697
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,920
can have membership in their virtual world in the sandbox.

698
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,160
That's a customer experience that people are paying for.

699
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,400
These NFTs might go for $10, $20, $30,

700
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,960
but they still go for value.

701
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,520
So there's an economic transaction value.

702
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,480
The other thing is that there's hundreds of metaverse builders

703
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,800
on sandbox who basically are building experiences

704
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,600
for third parties.

705
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,040
With a biopice of land, I want to basically build an experience.

706
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,200
Well, maybe I don't have time to build that experience.

707
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,120
So then I go and recruit one of these metaverse builders,

708
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,160
which are all over the world, pay them a certain amount of money.

709
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,080
And that, too, creates economic activity,

710
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,080
which then creates value in the ecosystem.

711
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,280
And the way that sandbox makes revenue

712
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,120
is outside of selling primary sales,

713
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,560
also, as we all know, NFTs, and takes a cut of secondary sales

714
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,520
in a low-simple-digit percentile.

715
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,840
And that's basically part of it.

716
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,120
So think of it almost as a VAT, if you will,

717
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,920
of building on the sandbox.

718
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,120
So OK, I didn't catch the last one.

719
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,680
So let's say, $3,000 NFT.

720
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,560
And you're counting as that part of the economy makes sense.

721
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,080
Does sandbox take a commission on that NFT?

722
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,680
It does.

723
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,240
It does take a commission on the primary.

724
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,640
And then on the secondary sales, it

725
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,320
takes a small clip of that as part of it being

726
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,840
originated from the sandbox.

727
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,040
And so those NFTs are minted on a sandbox-specific contract?

728
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,200
Yes.

729
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,920
So there's a tool that sandbox has

730
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,040
where you can create them as a voxel builder

731
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,920
and so that it can also be used inside the sandbox.

732
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:47,960
And so if those are, for example, the access NFT,

733
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,400
it lets you get into a building in sandbox.

734
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,440
They have to be minted on that contract.

735
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,560
So I think the point is that they could be.

736
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,600
But I think if someone was to build, for instance,

737
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,200
an NFT for access outside of the sandbox, they could do that too.

738
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,800
But usually these brand partnerships,

739
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,240
in particular, working conjunction with the sandbox,

740
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,600
because sandbox with then, for instance, promote it.

741
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,440
So there's also a little bit of this marketing effect.

742
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,920
Because when sandbox basically promotes it to their audience,

743
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,920
you're willing to give a part of your revenue share, shall we

744
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,880
say, to the sandbox because it can amplify your message.

745
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:27,280
So it's not just the platform itself.

746
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,080
It's a little bit like the app store.

747
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,880
When you're paying a revenue share to the app store,

748
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,320
you're not just paying it because it

749
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,600
gives you access to the platform.

750
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,200
You're also paying because it might feature you.

751
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,440
It might promote you.

752
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,200
It gives you something that gives you more customers.

753
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,640
So that's part of the trade you're

754
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,200
making when you're sharing revenue.

755
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,520
That makes sense.

756
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,680
Question, the visualization of sandbox.

757
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:54,480
I'm walking around in sandbox in my browser.

758
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,520
How does that happen?

759
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,960
What do you mean, how does that happen?

760
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,920
I mean, it's built in unity in terms of the front-end ship.

761
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,320
That's how it's built in unity.

762
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Great.

763
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Yeah.

764
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:16,400
So my model, my mental model for most of the blockchain-based

765
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:22,720
metaverses and games is that the in-game assets,

766
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,080
I think we can basically consider them completely

767
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,600
decentralized because they're NFTs.

768
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:38,120
And so I could say without any partnership with sandbox,

769
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,720
I could say I'm going to do an air drop for anyone who

770
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
has a sandbox NFT in their wall.

771
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,240
Right?

772
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,760
That's right.

773
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,800
Absolutely.

774
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,920
And I could say I can build a lending platform

775
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,360
that people can post their land for collateral.

776
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,160
And again, I don't have to do a partnership with sandbox.

777
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:00,600
In fact, I think NFTFI and Pawnfire really do that.

778
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,080
And I could say I'm going to build my own super core game.

779
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:11,440
And I can treat sandbox land as doing something in the game.

780
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,480
And again, I don't have to talk to sandbox, correct?

781
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:13,920
Correct.

782
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,240
Absolutely.

783
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:23,160
So at the end of environment, digital objects,

784
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:26,680
you have this level of decentralization,

785
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,480
composability, all of the general benefits of NFTs.

786
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760
And it's a huge step forward.

787
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,920
I was a kid to do this with a traditional one, two-game.

788
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,400
Correct.

789
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,160
And that's the whole frame around digital property rights.

790
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,400
You need to enjoy your digital property as you

791
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,760
do your physical property.

792
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,200
Now, the part that still has, I think, a level of centralization

793
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,360
and counterparty at risk, if you're

794
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:02,960
obsessive about these topics, like I am, is the rendering.

795
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,600
If you receive this opinion and said,

796
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,760
block this application in your Unity server,

797
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,440
because that's whatever violating something,

798
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,360
just each law or what.

799
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,960
It's threatening national security.

800
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,880
Making something up, right?

801
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,400
Yes.

802
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,320
Effectively, you can do it.

803
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,920
And because you're a company and you know,

804
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,200
and you're going to have to do it.

805
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
Is this fair?

806
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:28,840
That's fair.

807
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,520
But I think the point of perspective

808
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,960
is that on our platform, you then don't have the ability,

809
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:38,040
let's say, if something bad happened,

810
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,800
that we may have to take action on the platform

811
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,080
at the sandbox.

812
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,560
But that doesn't mean, and thinking of this key thing,

813
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,920
is that we have the ability to revoke your ownership.

814
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
So this is the principle.

815
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,240
So no matter what happens, we might

816
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,640
have to censor you for whatever reason.

817
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,160
But we can't revoke your ownership, right?

818
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
And that's an important principle,

819
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,080
which means that someone else can build an experience around it.

820
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,680
Or maybe you sell it to someone else, at least,

821
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,160
because maybe you're not allowed to use it.

822
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,880
But at least, it's yours to do it as you please.

823
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,920
Or you want to keep it anyway, just because if there's

824
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,120
a reason that we can allow you access because of some sanction

825
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,600
rules, as you say, or something else like that.

826
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,920
But the ownership is still yours.

827
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,680
Because there's some concepts where people

828
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
talk about not just revoking ownership,

829
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,920
but literally destroying the asset or some version of that.

830
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,920
That's not something that we do.

831
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,200
This makes perfect sense to me.

832
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,440
This is how I understood it.

833
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,720
It is obviously a huge step forward versus if it was just,

834
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:43,760
if it was just an account on a web2 type game,

835
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,280
and you receive that same order, it's just, bye bye, baby,

836
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,480
right?

837
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,200
The person who's walked out, the person's walked out.

838
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
They don't have access to any of their things.

839
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,960
And they'll never get them back.

840
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,560
That's correct.

841
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:55,760
Yeah.

842
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,880
And that's a classic album with web2 games

843
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,680
and web2 universes.

844
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,440
Yeah, it isn't that theoretically why Vitalik got into crypto.

845
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,440
Right?

846
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,320
So that he got robbed in some web2 game, is that correct?

847
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,920
It was more than Warcraft.

848
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,520
I think it was some powerful staff or something.

849
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,600
They nerfed it.

850
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,640
So this is slightly different.

851
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,120
They didn't take his ownership.

852
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,200
But what they did, if I recall correctly,

853
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,920
is that they changed the attributes

854
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,920
and made it not as powerful or not powerful at all.

855
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:26,400
And so all the effort he spent in doing this,

856
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,320
I think he described it, he cried himself to sleep

857
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,200
and realized the horrors of decentralization.

858
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,520
I don't know how much of this is drama or real,

859
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,600
but either way, right?

860
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,840
It happens to gamers a lot.

861
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,520
And I think one of the other things that we're excited about

862
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,960
the spaces, remember, there's like 3.4 billion gamers today.

863
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:45,200
That's more than close to 2 thirds of the world's internet.

864
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,680
So they're already very engaged in this virtual goods.

865
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,520
And you ask any gamer, do you own your stuff?

866
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,520
And they actually believe they own it,

867
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
even though according to the terms of service, they don't.

868
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:02,400
But imagine if these assets were actually on chain,

869
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
even if the game shuts down.

870
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,200
Yes, maybe the original utility dies.

871
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,800
But as we have seen in crypto, for instance,

872
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,120
actually third parties might emerge and say,

873
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,040
hey, you know what?

874
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,480
I can access this incredible community

875
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,960
by creating value to them.

876
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,040
And so instead of building a brand new game

877
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,840
and having a form of it from scratch,

878
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,000
I can actually make a game or an environment

879
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,400
to address an existing audience

880
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,720
of which a percentage might come over.

881
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,960
That really reduces, that's a very practical user acquisition

882
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:32,280
sort of tool that you can use.

883
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,440
And it gives more freedom in terms of ability

884
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,320
to create maybe multiple experiences,

885
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,720
because you're really just adding value

886
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,800
to the owners of these assets

887
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,800
who they might be willing to become your customers.

888
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,040
And let's call it the fantasy,

889
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,360
which I think will become reality,

890
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,240
but not with existing sort of games,

891
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,480
is imagine a fortnight, which sells skins,

892
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,640
which is basically like digital fashion.

893
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,360
It was on chain and was as free as a sandbox was.

894
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,560
Then someone else around the world can open a new game

895
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,600
called Fortnite Fashion Week.

896
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,280
And he can invite every player who owns skins from Fortnite

897
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,880
to come to his world and just experience it,

898
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,120
not for battle, but for something completely whimsical

899
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,840
or different or whatever, which is how innovation is driven

900
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,200
in most of the world, right?

901
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,880
Because you have the freedom to do whatever you want.

902
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,680
And that's the beauty of it.

903
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,320
And what will then happen is that

904
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,880
thousands of other game companies will do the same thing.

905
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,320
Who benefits the owner of the skin,

906
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,880
the owner of the asset, because they become,

907
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,400
their experiences and the utility becomes richer

908
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,040
as a result of having much more use cases

909
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,640
as in much more network effects.

910
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,040
But the original environment, which is what we believe in,

911
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,240
which is in this case would have been Fortnite,

912
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,880
benefits as well, because it becomes the center of that.

913
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,600
People go there to buy the skins

914
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,120
so they can get membership in a thousand other services, right?

915
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:55,160
So it actually is how we imagine Web3 to build it

916
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,240
is why we coin talk about Web3 as sort of sharing

917
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,920
the network effect because of that concept.

918
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,880
It makes perfect sense.

919
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,680
Let me, I bet I'm not going to get much out of you

920
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,880
on this one, but I have to ask.

921
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
Sure, of course.

922
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,520
I can yell that, I can yell that by someone if I don't ask.

923
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,440
What can you tell us about other side?

924
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,880
Ah, hahahaha.

925
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,720
Yes.

926
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,800
Feel free to lay out all the details

927
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,960
and everything that's going to happen.

928
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,640
There's only a few people watching, it's fine.

929
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,160
So, I definitely won't tweet it, it's fine.

930
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,600
I can certainly tell you that I would get yelled at

931
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,000
if I said anything deeply about other side.

932
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,600
Ha ha ha ha.

933
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,040
So I think the one thing I would say, first of all,

934
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,800
the announcement obviously of New CEO of Yuga

935
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,440
is certainly very exciting, right?

936
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,840
I think it just indicates a little bit in terms of

937
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,160
where the direction of Yuga's going,

938
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,080
what their ambitions are.

939
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,320
And I think that's an awesome development.

940
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,720
Should probably give you an indication as to the scale

941
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,560
and ambitions of what the other side wants to be

942
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,120
and is going to.

943
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,640
People have already seen the demo that was put together

944
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:12,640
obviously in partnership with Improbable.

945
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
And there's many more things developing

946
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,600
which I can't talk about, right, unfortunately.

947
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,080
But no one saying that if anything,

948
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,360
just if you look at historically

949
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,280
at the incredible creativity and talent

950
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,320
that Yuga has demonstrated every time

951
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,680
when they do something,

952
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,440
you know, is sort of proof from our perspective

953
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,120
to be excited about stuff.

954
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,280
And sort of to dovetail, although it's not directly related,

955
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,520
you know, some of the interesting activities,

956
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,120
controversial as it may be that's happening,

957
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,320
for instance, even at, you know,

958
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
Bitcoin which is separate,

959
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,480
but it's obviously tied as sort of let's call it

960
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,160
the token that is utilized there.

961
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,560
It's also evolving into a life of its own

962
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,000
that's completely different with, you know,

963
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,440
community members now joining the special council

964
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,880
after just coming election and driving changes there as well.

965
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,440
Sort of, I think there's this great sort of community

966
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,800
and sort of really democratic experiment

967
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,760
in tying basically sort of,

968
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,800
let's call it the community of Bitcoin together

969
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,280
with the world of Yuga under the other team.

970
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,240
But I'm afraid other side, I'm afraid

971
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,920
I can't say much more than that.

972
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,160
But I appreciate.

973
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,880
I appreciate you trying.

974
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,720
I have to try.

975
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,440
Before we do grand vision stuff,

976
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:24,520
I want to ask one question about something

977
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,560
in your portfolio that's different.

978
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,560
And you had started with me a few weeks, months ago, I think.

979
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
And tell us about TinyTap,

980
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,280
which is very good for everything else we've discussed.

981
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,120
Correct, yeah.

982
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:42,920
So first, what TinyTap is,

983
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,760
and we just completed another auction of a thing

984
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:47,920
called six teacher NFTs

985
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,360
and generated about a hundred and 90th

986
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,280
or some version of that, right?

987
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,000
Which, you know, across six teachers

988
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,200
is a substantial amount of money

989
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,560
for anyone who knows anything about, you know,

990
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,080
how much teachers are being paid.

991
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:00,000
So what is TinyTap?

992
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,120
TinyTap is originally a web2 platform

993
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,920
that was a teacher marketplace

994
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,680
where teachers basically create content

995
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,240
out of their spare time.

996
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,720
And someone, you know, parents can then subscribe

997
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,480
to this content and pay the teacher some fee.

998
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,080
And that's really what this is, right?

999
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:20,800
It's basically a tool or a teacher could create an app

1000
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,240
very easily because they don't know how to do that.

1001
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,480
And today, I think like over a hundred thousand plus teachers

1002
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,040
are using this to create, you know,

1003
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,760
kind of like a side income, call it like a side hustle, right?

1004
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:37,120
This platform basically generates sort of a service value

1005
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,920
to some of like 8.6 million families

1006
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,440
that subscribe basically to it

1007
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,280
and has a user base for that.

1008
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,800
What we did with TinyTap is we created this concept

1009
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:47,840
of true digital ownership.

1010
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:50,320
So one of the things that we believed

1011
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,320
that all content will become assets in web3, right?

1012
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,880
Because they become embedded as a digital property, right?

1013
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:58,160
Means that not only can they crew network effects,

1014
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,280
they become platforms in and of itself, right?

1015
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,040
If you look at, for instance, the ownership of a board A

1016
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,920
or a cool cat, actually the ownership of that asset

1017
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,960
means that you're not just owning, you know, a JPEG

1018
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,080
as it were, but you're actually a member of a platform.

1019
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,720
People come to you and say, oh, you own a board A,

1020
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,280
I have a T-shirt for you or I have a game for you

1021
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,920
or I have a service for you or I have a whiskey for you

1022
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,800
or I have a discount for you, right?

1023
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,560
Basically owning those NFTs become a platform.

1024
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,080
So that's the thesis in general

1025
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:28,800
for all things around content.

1026
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,240
So here we want to make teaching content

1027
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,880
become such a platform.

1028
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,400
And the very first network effect of that platform

1029
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,240
is the earning power that these NFTs already have

1030
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,320
through this concept called publisher NFTs.

1031
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Since a teacher already makes money from this content,

1032
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,000
small is it maybe, let's call it a thousand dollars a year,

1033
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,920
he or she gets paid, which is a meaningful

1034
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:52,920
but small amount of income

1035
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,320
relative to what the average teacher gets.

1036
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,680
I think the average teacher paid in the US

1037
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,520
is something like 40 to 50,000 less.

1038
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,080
But if you go to like sort of middle America,

1039
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,520
it ends up being closer to 25 to 30,000 US, right?

1040
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:05,600
It's quite small if you think about this is per annum, right?

1041
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,440
And we all felt that it was kind of ridiculous

1042
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,440
that probably the most important contributors

1043
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,440
to certainly sort of one of the most important contributors

1044
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,760
to society, if not the most important one,

1045
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,720
certainly for the formative stages of a children

1046
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,280
actually are so terribly underpaid, right?

1047
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,680
Now, when you take something that makes a thousand dollars

1048
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,440
a year and you allow it to have capital formation

1049
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,520
because let's call it someone can now buy it

1050
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,960
for 10 or 20% yield, he's willing to pay five

1051
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,720
or $10,000 for the same content.

1052
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,040
Still share in some of that revenue to the original teacher

1053
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,680
but he or she becomes the owner of that.

1054
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,120
This is what we do with real estate

1055
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,840
or with other forms of ownership.

1056
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,560
And this is real cash flow that's coming in.

1057
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,160
You now get the benefit of capital formation

1058
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,120
as we have seen in the world of real estate, for instance,

1059
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,640
or other kind of assets.

1060
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,680
But the beneficiary of a teacher who used to make $1,000

1061
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,960
on this content annually now getting paid $10,000

1062
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,000
one off on it and some revenue share thereafter,

1063
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,360
or fees as it were, is life-changing, right?

1064
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,840
And the first fee NFTs were sold.

1065
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,800
I think the most expensive one actually was sold

1066
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:10,960
for like maybe $60,000 or $70,000 for NFT

1067
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,920
that was making $15,000 a year in terms of income.

1068
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,320
Which frankly, from a yield perspective

1069
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,520
sounds very, very attractive, but from a teacher perspective

1070
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,000
is incredible life-changing money

1071
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,760
because it's basically almost two times your annual salary.

1072
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,440
And the very first thing she said is,

1073
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:29,240
she's gonna reinvest it, she's gonna make more content.

1074
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,840
And that's the whole thing about Web3

1075
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,400
because you're rewarding the people directly

1076
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,280
who would reconribute back into the ecosystem.

1077
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,200
Which by the way is how also one of the reasons

1078
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,880
why Web3 games works well.

1079
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:42,400
Because when you reward gamers,

1080
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,600
you're rewarding the ecosystem of players

1081
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,920
who give back to the ecosystem you're in

1082
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:49,960
as opposed to the ones that are just there to extract.

1083
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,160
So the hope basically is that we can turn this teaching content

1084
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,640
that is alternative ways of learning math or curriculum

1085
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:58,000
or philosophy or physics or whatever.

1086
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,440
That might just make a couple hundred dollars

1087
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,480
or $1,000 a year and sort of enjoy the benefits

1088
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,920
of this capital formation.

1089
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,080
Bring in third parties who are willing to obviously pay more

1090
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,200
for it because of the yield benefit,

1091
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,640
but then may also become their marketers.

1092
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,240
Remember, many teachers don't know anything

1093
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,400
about entrepreneurship, they make great content,

1094
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,000
but they don't know how to market or sell or whatever.

1095
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,960
And so this marketplace then also becomes a way

1096
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,360
in which a teacher could be tied in with someone

1097
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,040
who has maybe sales skills.

1098
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:27,160
He's investing in it, but he's gonna try to make it worth more

1099
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,800
because he's gonna promote the content

1100
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,560
so it can make more revenue and the all win.

1101
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,120
Which is basically sort of where I think

1102
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,120
the next stage of content evolution will go.

1103
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,360
And we started doing this with teachers partially

1104
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,000
because I was an early investor in TinyTap,

1105
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,440
so we liked what they were doing.

1106
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,040
And partially also because I have a personal interest

1107
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,120
in education, I think a lot of people who become

1108
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,240
young parents start to have an interest in education

1109
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,600
because they go, well, certain things don't work out the way

1110
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,880
they maybe we need an area.

1111
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,600
And so that's how I sort of got to know the guys

1112
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,760
in TinyTap and then felt that we could help.

1113
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,200
And we're sort of early days, but it's very promising

1114
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:04,320
and it's just another example of what digital property rights

1115
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,600
can do to your content.

1116
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,160
Okay, let's go for some big picture stuff.

1117
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,360
Sure.

1118
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,320
What is your definition of the metaverse?

1119
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,880
So we define the metaverse as a real metaverse,

1120
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,960
the open metaverse as one where it must begin

1121
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,200
with your ownership in it.

1122
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,400
Like meaning that if there's no way in which we can't have

1123
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,360
ownership in this metaverse, this virtual construct,

1124
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,200
then it's meaningless and therefore it's not real.

1125
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:36,800
So we could go into something like, let's say Fortnite

1126
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,080
or even Roblox and we could feel that it is some kind

1127
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,720
of virtual experience, but it's kind of,

1128
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,360
as we describe it, like going to Disneyland, right?

1129
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,880
It's like, yeah, fun, whatever and that's fine,

1130
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,880
but it doesn't mean anything because it's purely

1131
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,240
extractive and you don't build on top of it.

1132
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,960
Things like VR and AR and these other interfaces to us

1133
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,680
is experiencing what you own in the metaverse.

1134
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,200
In other words, it starts with the ownership, right?

1135
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,000
And then it's ways to experience the ownership

1136
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,480
rather than being the metaverse itself, right?

1137
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,040
So that's generally how we define it.

1138
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:12,120
It starts with digital ownership.

1139
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,960
Okay.

1140
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,960
How do we view the likelihood that the mega social media

1141
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,000
platforms that have huge installed user racism

1142
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,600
are spending gigantic amounts of money

1143
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,240
on their metaverse initiatives?

1144
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,920
How do you do the likelihood that what we're doing now

1145
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:41,720
is nice and important but still fairly small

1146
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,720
and then Facebook eventually rolls out a good enough product

1147
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:52,720
that has everything except for decentralization

1148
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,640
and people kind of roll into that instead of learning

1149
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,000
how to use Ethereum and MetaMask

1150
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,480
and all these types of things.

1151
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,440
So, if you had asked me this question two years ago,

1152
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,280
I would have considered, and I think I did write about this

1153
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,280
as potentially the biggest existential threat

1154
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,560
that the big platforms like, I guess, Facebook now

1155
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,600
rebranded Meta would do, but I no longer feel that

1156
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,040
because not because of what happened recently

1157
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,000
in terms of Facebook having to sort of lay off

1158
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,600
or the fact that Meta has not succeeded so far

1159
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,760
in the efforts but because the unit economics make it clear

1160
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,680
that Facebook cannot make it economically sustainable

1161
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,880
with the kind of unless they tax it heavily.

1162
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,320
And to me, this becomes the biggest detractor of it.

1163
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,000
Like, why would you want to pay 50% close to 50%

1164
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,160
is 47% which by the way is very close to the tax rate

1165
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,960
of North Korea, fun fact.

1166
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,880
But either way, right, why would you be willing to pay

1167
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,240
almost half of what you make in perpetuity to the platform

1168
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,600
so it can maintain its version of the metaverse

1169
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,200
when you can go into an open framework

1170
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,440
and literally just give up 5% of it.

1171
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,680
And maybe you were willing to pay 10% for the services

1172
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,520
but that 47% must come commensurate

1173
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,640
with services worth the 47%, right?

1174
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,080
You might be willing to live in Scandinavia

1175
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:17,200
because you pay more taxes because they give you services

1176
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,160
and therefore it's okay to pay more taxes.

1177
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,440
But it's very hard to see right now what that would be.

1178
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,480
And so it's going as a type.

1179
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,280
I made this comment where I said $10 billion a year

1180
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,720
on developing in the metaverse at Facebook

1181
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,560
is not enough money because in order for them

1182
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,480
to incentivize people to build on the meta

1183
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,840
they have to subsidize a far greater amount

1184
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,920
to be able to recreate the network effects

1185
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,560
that are currently available in the open framework.

1186
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:45,960
One of the things that people often complain about is,

1187
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,600
oh, the cost of gas even though it's come down,

1188
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,800
of course, a lot lately,

1189
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,320
but the cost of gas on something like Ethereum is expensive

1190
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,880
and it's prohibitive and so on.

1191
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,360
But it's not that bad when you consider

1192
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,800
the economic bad value you get.

1193
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,760
You're happy to spend one or $2 per transaction

1194
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,160
if you know you'll make five or $10 on top of it, right?

1195
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,320
Like you don't, it doesn't really matter how much you pay

1196
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,000
as long as the service you get for it.

1197
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,880
Meaning that this argument about sort of zero gas

1198
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:12,520
or no cost attached to the transaction is irrelevant

1199
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:15,440
if you don't get commensurate value for it back, right?

1200
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,520
If you're making one cent on a $0 fee

1201
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,640
then that's not as valuable as making $10

1202
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,040
on a $2 fee, right?

1203
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,920
And part of that is because the network effects

1204
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,120
on chain are already present.

1205
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,000
You know, if I issue something on Ethereum,

1206
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,920
I can trade it in OpenSea, I can give it to NFTFI,

1207
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,440
I can sell it somewhere else,

1208
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,840
I can use it in five different games.

1209
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:38,280
Look, you have these network effects already embedded

1210
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,720
and because you have this open sort of system

1211
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,600
that is essentially banking grade

1212
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,680
that anyone can develop on top of,

1213
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,280
for Facebook to recreate all of that,

1214
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,840
they have to spend so much money

1215
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,080
that it already exists on chain

1216
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,440
even if it's so-called inefficient,

1217
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,360
it works better than anything that Facebook

1218
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:58,520
will put together outside of the pure UX experience.

1219
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,040
And I think the point I believe in

1220
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,840
is that UX is important, of course, right?

1221
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,040
How do you onboard billions of people

1222
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,880
when you have Metamask and you have this

1223
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,120
and all that kind of stuff?

1224
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,760
But I think the incentive as we've seen,

1225
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,560
for instance, like X Infinity,

1226
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,600
is that if there is a good purpose for it,

1227
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,560
you're more than happy to go through the ropes

1228
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:21,920
and transfer yourself into basically the web3 world

1229
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,040
even with something as so-called complicated as a wallet,

1230
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,920
which is not that hard compared to opening a bank account.

1231
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,440
You know, and what happened with Axie

1232
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,840
is that in the Philippines,

1233
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,720
millions of Filipinos that are unbanked,

1234
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,000
don't have a credit card,

1235
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,320
ended up having a crypto wallet,

1236
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,800
survived basically COVID because of it.

1237
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,440
And now Philippines has suddenly become somewhat

1238
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,720
of a crypto hub because of the fact that,

1239
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:45,720
you know, millions of people now have a wallet

1240
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,680
that they learned how to do.

1241
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:48,840
We're not talking about people that are university educated,

1242
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,640
have a finance background and so on,

1243
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,040
they just knew how to do this.

1244
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,920
The other thing I would say

1245
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,760
why we think gaming is so interesting in this area

1246
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,600
is in terms of onboarding forward three,

1247
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,080
is that gamers themselves always learn a new skill

1248
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,280
when they learn a new game.

1249
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,720
Just think about, you know, the last game you played.

1250
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,080
You probably went through tutorial

1251
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,680
that probably took you five, 10, 20, 30 minutes.

1252
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,840
And by the end of it, you learn something new

1253
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,240
and you learn a new skill.

1254
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,720
You learn how to navigate a certain way,

1255
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,960
how to play the game a certain way

1256
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,040
or learn some lore and fact about the game

1257
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,960
that you never knew before,

1258
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,200
which is really, if you think about it,

1259
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,360
just entirely fiction, right?

1260
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,880
But now you have that skill

1261
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,880
and you're able to do the rest of the thing.

1262
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,800
I actually think that that is what through gaming

1263
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,440
and with sort of gaming UX can help evolve.

1264
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,560
So I'm more hopeful that we move more people

1265
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:38,120
into decentralized ecosystems than trying to sort of

1266
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,880
centralize and make it too easy

1267
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,520
because once you make it too easy,

1268
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,760
then you end up creating that risk of centralization

1269
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,160
and the fight for UX is what we have today in web too

1270
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,280
because that's the only thing of value,

1271
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,960
how to bring you in as quickly as possible

1272
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,720
because I'm not paying you for it, right?

1273
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:55,640
But if I actually, you know, have a choice

1274
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,080
to enter a social network because it rewards me

1275
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,680
with some value or I have ownership of my data,

1276
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,840
which I can then maybe monetize or do something else with it,

1277
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,400
then I'm more thoughtful about where I would go

1278
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,120
because there is real, something real at stake.

1279
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,120
Isn't the risk though that what Facebook is going to say

1280
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,120
is something similar to, I guess what's happening

1281
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,360
with that Apple app store.

1282
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,120
It says, yeah, I'm gonna take 50% of whatever you're,

1283
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,280
take 40%, 30%, whatever, they're some price, right?

1284
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,760
But I'm gonna give you access to many more people

1285
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,400
that are gonna otherwise buy your on-chain NFT.

1286
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,160
Is there a risk for them?

1287
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,000
They're, well, they can give you more customers

1288
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,640
but they can't give you more revenues.

1289
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,640
We've seen this now with web three.

1290
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:54,400
250,000 sort of customers on Sandbox generate more revenue

1291
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,800
than most web two games that have tens of millions

1292
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,600
of customers, right?

1293
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:04,320
You know, like, you know, look at Axie Infinity as well.

1294
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,080
So you have to, which means that you have to bring Facebook

1295
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,760
to a point where it's equivalent R pool

1296
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,080
has to be thousands of dollars per user in his lifetime,

1297
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,640
which is almost impossible in web two

1298
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,920
because the value ad can't be

1299
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,880
because there's no network effects, right?

1300
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,880
So if Facebook allowed for all these third party network

1301
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,880
effects to construct, it's like open source, right?

1302
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,440
Then there is so much value in there that, you know,

1303
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,840
you don't know where it's coming from almost

1304
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,280
because it's everywhere.

1305
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,680
But as a result, just building on top of it

1306
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,280
helps you sell or generate more.

1307
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,920
Take, for example, take, for example,

1308
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:42,800
why do people often mint on Ethereum

1309
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,400
as opposed to other chains?

1310
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,600
Because there's a better network effects already there.

1311
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,960
Even though it costs more

1312
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:49,840
because you know it can trade better, for instance,

1313
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:51,480
or there's third party networks

1314
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,480
or there's more liquidity as an example, right?

1315
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,160
Facebook has to recreate all of that, right?

1316
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,160
And, you know, you look at, for instance, NFT,

1317
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,320
just NFT trading volumes, I think in 2022,

1318
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,880
despite the bear and everything,

1319
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,600
I think we've reached probably close to $10 billion

1320
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,720
if not more this year, right?

1321
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,800
Oh, about $10 billion, effectively 90% of the value

1322
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:15,320
went straight to the owners of the NFTs, right?

1323
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,920
Because of the fact that it doesn't tax that much.

1324
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,760
How does Facebook compete with that?

1325
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,920
I mean, you know, they have to first argue

1326
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,320
that in order to make the same equivalent value,

1327
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,960
they must generate $50 billion of value

1328
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,120
in order to, or at least $30 billion of value

1329
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,400
in order to justify for them taking a 50% take rate, right?

1330
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:37,400
In an area where there's no natural network effects

1331
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,640
that can be constructed because it's all permission,

1332
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,560
meaning Facebook has to recreate and reproduce

1333
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,960
all of these network effects and benefits

1334
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,320
that an open network empirically already has.

1335
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,560
And I think this is, you know, a parallel to open source.

1336
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,240
So, you know, I guess, I'm not sure about yourself,

1337
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,080
but certainly for myself, I grew in a world

1338
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,840
where closed source was the norm.

1339
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,880
And when we're building an open source, you know,

1340
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,200
many of them were just saying, you know,

1341
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,000
basically literally just pooping on it

1342
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,640
because they're like, why would you build something

1343
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,680
that's open that anyone can copy, right?

1344
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:09,440
And just use, you know, what's the point in this, you know,

1345
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,280
you're giving up your intellectual property as it were, right?

1346
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,080
But now, you know, the network effect is that

1347
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,760
because I build on something, my code becomes public domain.

1348
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,680
Everyone else building on top of it, you know,

1349
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,080
the code then becomes a network in itself

1350
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,600
that has these powerful network effects

1351
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,120
where you get the benefit of thousands,

1352
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,520
but millions of coders involved in building

1353
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,280
a certain kind of code base,

1354
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,160
which even the biggest companies in the world

1355
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,800
can no longer compete against.

1356
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,240
Therefore, every big company in the world

1357
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:36,880
is now using open source as well

1358
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,400
and contributing back into the ecosystem as a result

1359
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,760
because they want to benefit from that.

1360
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,480
It's the same thing, right?

1361
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,320
But without the value construct,

1362
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,920
what Web3 now does is it encapsulates that,

1363
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,840
but in terms of value, therefore,

1364
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,480
it can share the network effects

1365
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:55,320
through the chain of ownership and origination,

1366
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,160
which again, I would say for Facebook to do that,

1367
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,560
it's just, I mean, you know, you never say never,

1368
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,480
you could say, but it's increasingly difficult to do that

1369
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,640
because of the fact that there's so much value already

1370
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,160
embedded and growing in Web3.

1371
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,840
So you're pretty optimistic, it strikes me.

1372
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,520
Well, I'm a kind of optimistic kind of guy,

1373
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,400
but yes, I am very optimistic.

1374
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,360
And, you know, if I wasn't optimistic,

1375
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,760
I wouldn't have entered the space probably four or five years ago

1376
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:27,080
because it was really bleak back then.

1377
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,600
So one of the ways to think about what you just said

1378
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:38,680
that I've thought of it times is the actual benefit

1379
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,320
of a business model perspective for publishers

1380
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,840
is that NFTs or crypto in general,

1381
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:51,080
in that NFT specifically have aggregated all of the world's

1382
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,080
people who are willing to pay for digital assets, right?

1383
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,960
Like, there's for sure there's a propensity,

1384
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:03,600
anyone who bought Bitcoin or then bought Ethereum

1385
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:06,920
and then bought a punk is the type of person

1386
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,800
that sees value in digital scarcity and digital assets.

1387
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,000
And then it's gonna have, you're saying it in ARP terms,

1388
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,720
but in a way it's an orientation that like,

1389
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,720
yeah, it makes sense to me that a ringer is $70,000

1390
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,960
or the land and sandboxes, $15,000

1391
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,440
and I'd be willing to pay for it.

1392
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,520
And you're saying the yes, Facebook has two billion users,

1393
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:35,520
but user number 632 million is not mentally there

1394
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:38,520
that they should pay anything for anything online.

1395
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,120
Is it something like that?

1396
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,600
It is, but it's also the fact that Facebook's ability

1397
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,720
to monetize because of its limited network effects

1398
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,080
because it needs to control everything around it.

1399
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,800
Doesn't allow for permissionless growth

1400
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,280
in the benefits of value to a group.

1401
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,360
So, meaning that you need something permissionless

1402
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,120
in order to have these network effects

1403
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,560
that make an asset valuable.

1404
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:02,480
Just think about sort of when we think of the origins

1405
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,840
of a creation, we think of utility first.

1406
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:07,880
Like if the Ford Model T was first mass produced car,

1407
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,800
I think, and it had one thing, it had one task.

1408
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,600
It was to drive from point A to point B fairly efficiently

1409
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,400
and they're all black.

1410
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,840
And that was great, right?

1411
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,840
However, today you don't buy a car

1412
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,800
because it just takes you from point A to point B.

1413
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,640
The reason you buy a car are mirrored.

1414
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,080
There's probably hundreds if not thousands of reasons

1415
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,960
why you choose one car over the other

1416
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,080
because it looks good, social status,

1417
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,760
let the seats, services, accessibility,

1418
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,360
is it electric, is it not, is it whatever, right?

1419
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,440
And these are all third party network effects

1420
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:38,600
that were constructed in a permissionless manner.

1421
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,080
If all of those guys had to go to

1422
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,520
the original creator of whatever car manufacturers say,

1423
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,280
am I allowed to make a baby seat?

1424
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,000
Am I allowed to hire a driver for this car?

1425
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,360
Am I allowed to do all this stuff?

1426
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:49,040
First of all, they wouldn't be able to handle it

1427
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,280
because it's just too many requests.

1428
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,080
And so it limited its growth.

1429
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:56,320
But also the innovation that would come from that

1430
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,520
whimsical as some of them may be

1431
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,480
would not build the utility of these assets

1432
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,640
as big as they are today, right?

1433
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:05,800
And today, we buy all sorts of things

1434
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,280
that we are not really for its utility per se.

1435
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,240
I mean, you don't buy your shoes just to walk.

1436
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:13,960
But the reason you chose that shoe

1437
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,040
isn't because it is the most efficient way

1438
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,800
to walk from point A to point B.

1439
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,520
You chose it because of its colors,

1440
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,400
because of its brand, because of what your friends say,

1441
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,200
or all that kind of stuff, right?

1442
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,120
And so these are the kind of effects

1443
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,520
that human innovation and invention and creativity creates

1444
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,720
that when it becomes permissioned is limited

1445
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,920
because someone else, like an app store,

1446
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,720
says you're allowed and you're not allowed, right?

1447
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:39,360
I mean, imagine what open source would have looked like

1448
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,320
if the code that was an open source

1449
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,680
was permissioned by its original creator.

1450
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,760
I like this.

1451
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,360
I mean, you can endorse one,

1452
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,160
but if he had the, if he was the one who always

1453
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,320
was the gatekeeper of the service

1454
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,160
that this code could evolve,

1455
01:03:55,160 --> 01:03:59,160
we would probably be 20 years behind

1456
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:01,440
in terms of the evolution of where we are

1457
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,760
with technology and innovation as a result of that, right?

1458
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,560
These network effects compound.

1459
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,760
And that is basically what you need to,

1460
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,760
you can only achieve in an open and permissionless manner.

1461
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,040
You simply can't do that in anything that's permission,

1462
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,000
which Facebook and all these platforms are still trying to do

1463
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
because they're trying to protect their business model,

1464
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,960
which is around ownership and control of the data.

1465
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,200
It's very existentially risky for them to open up,

1466
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,800
as it was, it's a classic innovators dilemma.

1467
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,800
Okay, I have many more questions I want to ask you,

1468
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:36,440
but I want to give, you're going to ask some questions.

1469
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,520
I'm going to ask you one more now.

1470
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:39,360
Please.

1471
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:45,880
Or does your view on the currently very complicated

1472
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,640
royalties debate?

1473
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:51,480
Yeah.

1474
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,960
Well, okay.

1475
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,520
So first off, we think royalties absolutely have to be,

1476
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,280
have to be paid.

1477
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:00,160
I think there's a little bit of a war going on

1478
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,320
between the platforms and in some ways, the marketplaces

1479
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,680
that are many of them which are our own portfolio

1480
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:07,920
and we're having conversations with them as well,

1481
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,280
around trying to use this somewhat in the narrative

1482
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,880
to sort of, obviously, gain competitive advantage

1483
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,280
of some sort or the other, right?

1484
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,080
So this conversation around, black is staying,

1485
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,800
use our contract if you don't use it,

1486
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,800
you don't share royalties.

1487
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,640
That's one perspective, right?

1488
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,720
We have taken an approach and put it out as public domain,

1489
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,600
basically a licensing structure.

1490
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:31,520
That licensing structure is one where we say that,

1491
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,040
you know, when you own this NFT, you know,

1492
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,920
you have to buy it by a certain legal perspective.

1493
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,080
And let me explain sort of the thinking behind that

1494
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,800
because, again, it goes to our first core principle,

1495
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,080
which is true digital ownership.

1496
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,960
If you can revoke ownership,

1497
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,840
if you can revoke access, if you can black-est,

1498
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:54,040
then there is, for us, a intrinsically sort of philosophical

1499
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:58,320
and perhaps even active sort of conflict

1500
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:00,040
between do you truly own it?

1501
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,000
Do you truly own an asset that someone can revoke access to

1502
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,400
because you violate the terms of service?

1503
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,160
Our perspective is that, you know, you can revoke terms of service,

1504
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:11,920
you can revoke access yourself as a game company.

1505
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,040
For instance, if you violate the terms of service,

1506
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,040
then Sandbox can revoke access to you using the asset

1507
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:20,000
in the Sandbox until you make it whole.

1508
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,920
But I can't, or we shouldn't, be able to remove

1509
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,960
the ownership of it because at the end of the day,

1510
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,400
you know, you still own it.

1511
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,800
You just not allow it to perhaps use it because you,

1512
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,560
you know, violated the terms of service,

1513
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,680
but it's still yours, right?

1514
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,040
There's a distinct difference between,

1515
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,280
but a very big difference between the two, right?

1516
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,080
And the legal arrangement that we think of is that,

1517
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,800
you know, let's say if a marketplace was in violation

1518
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:48,600
of allowing the trade of NFTs at over royalty,

1519
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:53,080
then the liability accrues to the marketplace

1520
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,360
and unless it takes down the connection whole,

1521
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,800
whatever value it generates,

1522
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:59,320
because on chain, the beautiful thing about on chain is,

1523
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,200
you can measure how much it was traded, right?

1524
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,640
You can easily measure the damages that you can claim for.

1525
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,720
They become liable, very similar to what happened to Napster

1526
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,000
and sort of, you know, DMCA type, sort of, type of rules.

1527
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,480
Roralties is critical because to us,

1528
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:17,240
the royalties giving value to the creators

1529
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,880
creates a distribution and decentralization of money,

1530
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:24,200
which is a decentralization of power, right?

1531
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,080
So if all of the money gets centralized in one ecosystem,

1532
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:30,160
as we have seen with things like the App Store or Spotify

1533
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,720
or, you know, ASCAP for music rights, right?

1534
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,800
They start out with a noble mission, but then, you know,

1535
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,080
as the saying goes, you know,

1536
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,800
absolute power curves absolutely.

1537
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,480
Suddenly you have all this money,

1538
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,320
all you centralize all this power

1539
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:45,680
because money effectively is a proxy for power.

1540
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,000
And then they do things that become anti-competitive

1541
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,280
because it's in their interest to do so.

1542
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,520
And to prevent that, we have to enable a distribution

1543
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,960
of that value as widely as possible.

1544
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,880
And royalties is one way to do it.

1545
01:07:57,880 --> 01:07:59,560
If, you know, hundreds of thousands,

1546
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,320
if there are millions of artists in the world,

1547
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,120
are, you know, earning royalties directly themselves,

1548
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,160
then you're effectively also ensuring a decentralized

1549
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,800
and distributed future.

1550
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,480
So royalties is absolutely critical, I think,

1551
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:15,200
for the decentralization, he fails to stay alive and well.

1552
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,200
Great, okay, let's, it was very interesting topic.

1553
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:26,960
And again, this is another one where I could do 20 follow-ups

1554
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,960
but we'll never get to questions if I don't be quiet.

1555
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:37,480
So I am switching to these student questions.

1556
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:45,960
And, okay, well, if there's one that's relevant

1557
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:48,520
to this topic, so I'll ask this one first.

1558
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:51,040
What I'm curious about is why projects are creating

1559
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,960
block lists and not white lists or analysts.

1560
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,120
You list allowed marketplaces, not the ones you want to block.

1561
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,400
Well, okay, so first there is a commercial incentive

1562
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,440
for marketplaces to create essentially black lists

1563
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,920
of block lists.

1564
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,840
And the reason why is because it's, you know,

1565
01:09:09,840 --> 01:09:12,600
you could say a form of, you know,

1566
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,320
I know if you want to call it anti-competition

1567
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,680
but it's a way to ensure that you have to sort of come

1568
01:09:16,680 --> 01:09:18,240
to our marketplace instead, right?

1569
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,520
So, so, you know, now, so it's, again,

1570
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,680
it's a different type of approach where if you're on that,

1571
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:27,040
you can sort of isolate and say,

1572
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,400
look, I don't like this competitor.

1573
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,840
I think this person's a bad person.

1574
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,680
So I'm going to sort of block this particular site.

1575
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,120
As opposed to, so the whitelist approach

1576
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,960
is actually however arguably more onerous, right?

1577
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,120
Because it means that you have less freedom

1578
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,440
because you, a whitelist means you have to literally sort

1579
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:46,560
of open up, you start from the assumption of guilt

1580
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:48,600
where you basically say everyone's bad,

1581
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,040
only these guys are good versus the black list of block lists

1582
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,480
is more of a sort of, you have to make an assumption

1583
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,600
that, you know, everyone is okay

1584
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,080
and only these guys are bad.

1585
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,680
So we're going to sort of isolate them

1586
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,800
because they're the bad actors.

1587
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,080
So it comes from a slightly different place

1588
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:06,640
or with actually very different outcomes.

1589
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,480
Okay.

1590
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,040
Next question.

1591
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:12,720
Do you believe that eventually the big players,

1592
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,960
i.e. Meta, will use existing technologies

1593
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,440
or will they keep trying to reinvent the wheel?

1594
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,640
So I guess it'll come down to a point

1595
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,600
where they will be financially,

1596
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,000
I think they will be financially compelled

1597
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,760
to move on something open

1598
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,960
and Facebook or Meta in this case,

1599
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,400
does struggle with a bunch of things.

1600
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,320
Because remember, you know,

1601
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:41,960
when Mark actually tried to do stuff early on,

1602
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,120
he tried to do liberal.

1603
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,320
So this is a guy who understands blockchain

1604
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,160
and crypto and the potential on this one

1605
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,640
because, you know, he tried to actually push very early on

1606
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:52,680
this, there's sort of a, I guess a kind of decentralized

1607
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,400
cryptocurrency in his perspective.

1608
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,800
And he had a big blockchain lab,

1609
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,560
which basically morphed, you know, two very well established

1610
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,480
sort of a blockchain technology,

1611
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:04,600
a layer, layer ones, you know,

1612
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:06,520
app tots and this and that's right.

1613
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:08,280
So within Facebook, you know,

1614
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:10,720
there's obviously been a lot of resources spent on this,

1615
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,720
but failed for a number of reasons.

1616
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:15,160
Many of them that were outside of his control

1617
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:18,200
because of the fact that Facebook was viewed

1618
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,200
in a suspicious manner,

1619
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,520
perhaps rightly so given the history.

1620
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,240
So I think however, they won't be able to compete

1621
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,440
by building their own system

1622
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,520
because they've got too many incumbent issues.

1623
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,880
And so I think they will ultimately adopt something

1624
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,720
and framework that's out there or multiple frameworks

1625
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,800
and become a platform for that, for survival

1626
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,640
or basically go under, right?

1627
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,280
Which is a classic innovation cycle, right?

1628
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,840
You either sort of, you know, reinvent yourself

1629
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,160
or you, you know, you go out of business, right?

1630
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:49,240
So I think this is the path for someone like that

1631
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:52,080
because for all the reasons that I had mentioned earlier.

1632
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:54,960
Okay.

1633
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:59,320
I have two questions about, I think your investment side

1634
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
and I'm gonna combine them.

1635
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,440
I think I'm gonna ask them together.

1636
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,260
Of course.

1637
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:06,760
First is, are you seeing the flow of capital

1638
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,120
from these investments back into the,

1639
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,760
or into the NMOCA ecosystem?

1640
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,360
I think it means back into the NMOCA ecosystem

1641
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:16,080
or is it still in the lag stage?

1642
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,280
And then at one point, does NMOCA say,

1643
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:22,360
okay, we've done enough of these strategic investments

1644
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,200
and we'll start to look at returns?

1645
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:26,640
I think they might be the same question.

1646
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,160
Yeah, I think they're kind of related.

1647
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:31,000
So first of all, the way what we like to measure things,

1648
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,400
which is in all the case,

1649
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,240
is we think of it in terms of the economic output

1650
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,560
that the investment will create.

1651
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:38,840
That's actually the priority.

1652
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,200
The fact that it has an equity return

1653
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,560
is a construct of the fact that the business grows

1654
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:47,480
because of the benefit of the ecosystem.

1655
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,680
So for instance, it's more valuable to us.

1656
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,880
For better or for worse,

1657
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,800
we still have all of our OpenSea shares for instance.

1658
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,400
And if we're a peer investor, we should have sold them.

1659
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,400
But our benefit on this one was the fact

1660
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:04,040
that we wanted to make sure that we were close to OpenSea

1661
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,920
and building with them because we are thinking

1662
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,040
that not just our products,

1663
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,960
but also products in our portfolio,

1664
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,480
have a line of gateway to say, trade their assets freely.

1665
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:15,760
And if there's a problem with OpenSea

1666
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,120
and all that kind of stuff,

1667
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,640
that's part of the value added benefit.

1668
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,640
So the billions of dollars of economic activity

1669
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,720
that OpenSea generates is more valuable to us

1670
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:31,040
than the billions of dollars of potential return

1671
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,040
that it can give to us in a one shot in the near term.

1672
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:36,880
Now, to the point of what happens in the mid to long term,

1673
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,800
if these network effects start to become very embedded

1674
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,920
and natural as they're beginning to evolve,

1675
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,120
then it's sensible for an organization

1676
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,640
like ours to start taking some profit on the equity side.

1677
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:49,600
But what we would then naturally do is redeploy it

1678
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:51,000
because it accrues into our equity,

1679
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,640
because our investment in things like OpenSea or Axie

1680
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:55,360
or so on, it's on balance sheet.

1681
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,920
So we don't have an obligation to,

1682
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,760
we don't have to, like a fund,

1683
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,600
takes investor capital and then pays out investor capital

1684
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:04,640
as a return.

1685
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,960
Here it's operating capital into the business,

1686
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:09,080
which you could then choose to use to build something else

1687
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,040
or maybe invest in other things and so on.

1688
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:13,160
In terms of when will we stop investing?

1689
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,240
No, I don't think so.

1690
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,960
We may invest differently when the market changes.

1691
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,920
So for instance, right now, we are at the early,

1692
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,520
super early adopter stage, which means that we need to invest,

1693
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:27,920
I think more aggressively, but more distributed,

1694
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:30,280
meaning that there's going to be a lot more early stage

1695
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,200
investments, even though some of them become quite large.

1696
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,600
Whereas, later on as the market evolves,

1697
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,400
there's probably going to be more late stage investment,

1698
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,960
but also more concentrated type of investments

1699
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:43,760
because the market is mature.

1700
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:46,840
And we haven't even properly reached the consolidation

1701
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,760
stage of what's happening to work through,

1702
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,680
which is probably still a few years out.

1703
01:14:50,680 --> 01:14:52,800
So I think there is going to be an evolution,

1704
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,320
but we will never stop investing.

1705
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:56,920
Because if we stop investing, that means

1706
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,160
that we think there's an end to it,

1707
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,480
which we don't believe.

1708
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:04,360
There's going to be evolutions and durations and twists

1709
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:05,680
in this market as we have seen.

1710
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:07,640
I mean, just look at this year, right?

1711
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:11,400
These last 12 months has probably been 10 lifetimes

1712
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:12,400
for most industries.

1713
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:18,720
I think that's a good answer.

1714
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:20,240
Let's go to the next question.

1715
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:23,680
So can you elaborate on the unit economics?

1716
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,520
And then I don't know if these are different for a sandbox

1717
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:28,920
versus a more gaming oriented.

1718
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:31,360
So I'll let you answer that the way

1719
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,880
you think you should be answering.

1720
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:36,120
OK, so let me first translate gaming value.

1721
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:37,400
I think this is really important for people

1722
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,200
who are not a gaming studio understand.

1723
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:42,000
So I had, because a lot of people sometimes also wonder,

1724
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,240
where does the value come from when you're creating a token

1725
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,080
and you have rewarding people in something

1726
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,880
like Play to Earn to Play the game for free, so to speak?

1727
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,200
Why is that even valuable?

1728
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:53,400
Isn't that just some kind of punsy or something?

1729
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,960
Because where does the money come from?

1730
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:01,760
So in the gaming world, which is over $200 billion

1731
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,560
this year in terms of revenue, there

1732
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,320
are a few areas where the cost goes out.

1733
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,840
Outside of game development and production, which we all know.

1734
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,800
And the first one, obviously, is the fact

1735
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,440
that there's only a small percentage of people, as I said,

1736
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:16,240
who convert.

1737
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:19,240
So most of the revenue comes from a single digit percentage

1738
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,520
of the gaming world, which are basically, I mean,

1739
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,640
I don't know if you can translate them as NFT whales.

1740
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:27,240
They're not really that, but similar type of behavior.

1741
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:28,200
So that's the first point.

1742
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,640
But those guys don't pay unless they have someone

1743
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:31,720
to play with.

1744
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,400
Imagine if you go into Fortnite and you're the only guy there,

1745
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,560
nobody else to play with you.

1746
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,760
You're not going to pay.

1747
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,800
So all the people who are there playing for you, effectively,

1748
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:43,720
you could argue are targets to shoot at.

1749
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:47,800
In a challenging way, as it were, having fun, of course.

1750
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,840
In induce people to pay because it's

1751
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:53,400
fun to continue and to evolve in that environment.

1752
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,440
So the other way to look at it is that every person who

1753
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,000
plays these games for free is maybe getting enjoyment for free,

1754
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,480
but actually, they're being paid.

1755
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,120
They're free labor, I mean.

1756
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:06,320
Because they're the reason why people actually pay money.

1757
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:09,360
Because if you're not there, then you're not going to pay money.

1758
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,320
So the first part of tokenization

1759
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:14,160
creates a way in which you can value that ecosystem.

1760
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,760
So in other words, in one person in the system

1761
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,600
starts paying thousands of dollars because he's

1762
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,400
having so much fun, basically battling

1763
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,040
or playing with these other people.

1764
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,200
The other people in the environment

1765
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:26,920
have a way of measuring that now through tokenization.

1766
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:29,480
Whether it's worth $1.75, $20, that really

1767
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,600
depends entirely on the game.

1768
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:34,000
And in this case, of course, the fun, and the game,

1769
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,120
and the design of it.

1770
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:37,880
But there is a value that you can now finally measure.

1771
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:40,120
And the second part, which is probably the bigger part

1772
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:42,240
in the costs of the platform, is 1%.

1773
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:47,520
30% platform fees, whether it's Steam, Apple, Google Play,

1774
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,320
the consoles, they charge that first as a platform fee.

1775
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,120
So that's a lot of money.

1776
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,680
That's billions of dollars.

1777
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,440
And then this year alone, for app installs,

1778
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:01,760
over $110 billion will be spent just on app installs.

1779
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,440
Every game developer will tell you

1780
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,200
their biggest cost is user acquisition.

1781
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,360
Basically, UI and CPI is what they drive for.

1782
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,280
Meaning, how can I get the lowest kind of cost per install

1783
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:14,320
so I can get the highest kind of return?

1784
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,280
So become very technical that way.

1785
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,360
But when you add that all up in the $200 billion industry,

1786
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,320
close to 2-thirds of that actually

1787
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:24,720
goes to Apple, Google, Facebook, and advertisers.

1788
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,080
So actually, you could argue that the biggest game

1789
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,640
studies in the world are actually also

1790
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,360
working for Apple and Google and Facebook.

1791
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,280
Because all that value, both in forms

1792
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:35,800
of advertising and marketing and platform fees goes to them.

1793
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,440
Now, how much of that value goes back

1794
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:41,200
to the gaming economies that they're expecting from?

1795
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,720
Close to zero.

1796
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,280
Apple doesn't invest in games.

1797
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,560
Facebook doesn't invest in games.

1798
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,040
They just park their money in Ireland.

1799
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,480
They just completely accumulate.

1800
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,680
Now, what happens in web3 gaming,

1801
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,040
and why the unit economics becomes so interesting,

1802
01:18:56,040 --> 01:19:00,200
is that you actually share that value to the users.

1803
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,360
For instance, when you do an NFT ad drop,

1804
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:04,560
that is free, for instance, for gamers,

1805
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:06,080
the way to think of it is like, well,

1806
01:19:06,080 --> 01:19:08,080
I just did a $5 million marketing campaign.

1807
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:12,080
Instead of paying $5 million to Facebook to promote a game,

1808
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,880
I just paid $5 million in marketing,

1809
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:17,680
so to speak, to attract a certain audience to come play the game.

1810
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,200
I didn't give it to them in free tokens.

1811
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,400
I gave it to them in NFTs.

1812
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:21,840
If they don't like it, they can sell the NFTs

1813
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,000
and they can cash out.

1814
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,960
Or if I like it, actually, I can reinvest or play the game

1815
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:29,160
or promote it or do other things.

1816
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,320
And what we've seen, the propensity of a gamer being rewarded

1817
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,720
to put back in the game, is infinitely higher

1818
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:35,840
than anything of the platforms,

1819
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,080
which is why the unit economics accumulate.

1820
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,680
Because value that is going out instantly comes back in,

1821
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,480
because of the fact that players are willing to re-engage

1822
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,840
much more likely than any platform whose sole purpose

1823
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,560
is to extract and make as much profit as possible.

1824
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,520
So then down to the question of ARPU.

1825
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,360
The ARPU, then, therefore, has more value already initially,

1826
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,320
because there's more capital flowing in the system,

1827
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:01,320
because it's going to the right parties.

1828
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,520
It's like giving money to your citizens

1829
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:05,160
as opposed to giving it to a corporation.

1830
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,680
If you give money to your citizens,

1831
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,840
they're going to spend it.

1832
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,760
Giving money to a corporation, they're going to save it

1833
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:13,200
and do something else and try to build some monopoly

1834
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,040
somewhere else.

1835
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:18,480
So that's the macro.

1836
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,120
Now, in terms of how value can be measured,

1837
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:25,400
it comes down to the ideal of property rights.

1838
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:30,520
If a gaming asset is worth $5 or $10 in a web2 narrative,

1839
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:35,600
it's probably worth $100 or $300 in a web3 one,

1840
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,080
because of the ability to construct network effects

1841
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,600
and property rights and, therefore,

1842
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,400
the benefits of ownership attached to it.

1843
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,840
Kind of like if you rent a piece of property

1844
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:46,560
and then you were going to buy it,

1845
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:48,680
you wouldn't buy it for one or two times rent.

1846
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:51,200
You would buy it for what you think its long-term value

1847
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,080
is because now you have ownership and you can invest in it

1848
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,600
and you can accrue it.

1849
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,320
Now, of course, it's not exactly the same ratios

1850
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,880
because it also depends on whether you think the game has

1851
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,800
a longevity, whether the game is fun,

1852
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,240
whether the players are there, all that kind of stuff.

1853
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,240
But you can make that calculation.

1854
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,440
And so that's one way in which you can value it.

1855
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,160
But it really depends on the game economy.

1856
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:18,400
It's not a straightforward answer as in everything is $100, $200.

1857
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,440
It doesn't work this way.

1858
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,280
The design of the game is equally important

1859
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,880
to ensure that you can drive value.

1860
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,480
But it will have a higher likelihood of return

1861
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:31,000
because even casual games that are worth sense

1862
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,880
are not going to be worth tens of cents, shall we say.

1863
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:35,560
You just have more earning potential

1864
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,880
on a game in which you have true ownership.

1865
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,080
Thank you, that was a very detailed answer.

1866
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,400
I think we have two more to try and squeeze in two more

1867
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,800
questions.

1868
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:55,760
The first is about metadata.

1869
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:57,080
It's actually a pretty good question.

1870
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:00,120
It says some games, they say they use the NFT,

1871
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,040
but the metadata is on a private centralized server.

1872
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:11,120
Can you see an outcome where the metadata is de-centralized

1873
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:13,240
through the NFT itself?

1874
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:14,960
I think eventually we'll get to a point

1875
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:16,840
where everything has to be on-chain.

1876
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,200
But we're not there yet for many practical reasons,

1877
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,920
including transaction speed, technology evolution, and so on.

1878
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,120
I draw back parallels from the early days

1879
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,880
of when we're building online games or online systems

1880
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,280
back in the 90s or already 2000s.

1881
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:38,640
And it was much slower, not just because of compute power,

1882
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,920
but just the software and everything.

1883
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,720
It was just less memory, best network speeds.

1884
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:45,360
And so there are many things we couldn't do that we can do

1885
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,200
today.

1886
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,000
And I think of chain technologies in exactly the same way.

1887
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:55,280
And it has to, because in order to have more data on chain,

1888
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,640
and in this case, the metadata, including

1889
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,080
the transactional elements, like right now, for instance,

1890
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:03,120
when you play a web3 game, much of the gameplay,

1891
01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:05,200
like in Sandbox, is off-chain, because you

1892
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,720
can't build this kind of real-time gaming on-chain yet.

1893
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:12,760
But that means that you can't then

1894
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:15,120
build from the benefit of what happens on-chain

1895
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,840
to create new services on top of it.

1896
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:18,280
When it's on-chain, someone else

1897
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:19,920
can compose a new experience on top of it,

1898
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,400
because it's transparently visible for someone

1899
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,880
to construct on top of it.

1900
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,000
So we have to get to that point.

1901
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,520
So we're at phase one, if you want, or maybe 1.5.

1902
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:30,440
When we get to a point where everything is on-chain,

1903
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,520
including metadata, as well as actual transactions

1904
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,120
that happen inside games, including outcomes

1905
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,000
that we do inside a game, then again,

1906
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,040
you have intermediaries enter and say, OK,

1907
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,880
I can create an analysis tool based on what

1908
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:43,160
happens in this gameplay.

1909
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:45,080
Or I can maybe do some system work

1910
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,560
with this person plays against another, and it's on-chain.

1911
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,240
I can verify a reward if I want to do this.

1912
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,480
And the same goes with metadata.

1913
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:52,880
Metadata is on-chain.

1914
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:54,920
Then I can also, again, sort of openly

1915
01:23:54,920 --> 01:23:58,000
compose and build experiences on top of it

1916
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,120
with a certainty as opposed to something

1917
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,920
that's centralized, that could take it away or could alter it.

1918
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,160
And then I can sort of build and experience

1919
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:09,760
utilizing that metadata with a certainty

1920
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:15,600
that I wouldn't have with something that could be altered.

1921
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:16,600
OK.

1922
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:24,760
I see a question online, actually, from a pretty well-known

1923
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,000
open-source advocate who said, must be watching the sessions.

1924
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:35,080
I was really happy to see your commitment to open-source

1925
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,760
and believe in it.

1926
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,480
But also, the repository for Animal Care

1927
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,560
was fairly limited and contributions back.

1928
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:45,800
Is that accurate?

1929
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:47,920
How do you really think about that?

1930
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,560
How should we all be contributing to open-source?

1931
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,880
So I think one of the things why I think

1932
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:57,720
you should look at the repository is not a animoka itself,

1933
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,640
but of all of our subsidiaries, whether it's sandbox or darewise

1934
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,360
or blowfish.

1935
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,920
So we have a whole collection of companies

1936
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,080
that is contributing to open-source.

1937
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:11,160
An animoka itself doesn't basically say, and just by design,

1938
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,360
doesn't say that we are the owners or creators of this repository.

1939
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:16,080
We do have stuff in open-source as well,

1940
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,680
but Animoka itself actually is a sum of parts.

1941
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,440
So the organization can live in its own identity.

1942
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,360
So Animoka is a big contributor.

1943
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:26,880
When you also look at the history of the private sector of things

1944
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:28,920
like Animoka, like Alplay's, you'll

1945
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,960
see lots of open-source contributions.

1946
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:34,360
But they will come from basically all of the group companies

1947
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:37,040
as well, which are owned by us, rather than necessarily

1948
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,040
one company.

1949
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:40,720
For instance, we don't have a perspective.

1950
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,720
And this, again, has a little bit to do with our philosophical

1951
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:48,200
perspective, which is that maybe if you were part of Facebook

1952
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,080
or meta, then even if you're a subsidiary,

1953
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:52,600
when you post something open-source,

1954
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:55,280
you make the contribution and give it credit to, say,

1955
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,920
meta on Facebook.

1956
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,760
But at Animoka, we would give the credit

1957
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:01,360
to the team that was involved in it, which

1958
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:06,640
would be, for instance, sandbox, or maybe blowfish,

1959
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:09,480
or whatever entity that's involved

1960
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,600
in creating those contributions.

1961
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,640
Because we think of ourselves almost more of a federated model

1962
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,880
than, I guess, as a, I guess, like a corporate model,

1963
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,200
if you'd like, as it were.

1964
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,080
OK.

1965
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,240
Well, let me ask the last non-question question.

1966
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:30,480
What is the question we should have asked you,

1967
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:35,120
or I should have asked you, but we didn't ask you?

1968
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,400
The question you should have asked me.

1969
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,880
Interesting.

1970
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:49,840
So I think maybe the one area that I am spending time

1971
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:51,880
thinking on, which I am not entirely sure

1972
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,960
I have an answer to per se, but I'm spending a lot more time

1973
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,760
is on DAOs.

1974
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,600
And what digital ownership means for that.

1975
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,520
Like, I'm excited.

1976
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,360
One of the things that excites me of a digital ownership,

1977
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:05,120
so I'm reminded by a sort of this George Washington quote,

1978
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,840
about how he says that, I think it's freedom and property

1979
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:10,200
rights are intertwined.

1980
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,760
You can have one without the other.

1981
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,880
And I think of the same way for digital property rights,

1982
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,560
meaning that you can't actually have digital freedom

1983
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:19,520
if you don't have digital property rights.

1984
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,680
So how do we get there?

1985
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:23,240
And digital property rights isn't just a technical term.

1986
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,520
Blockchain allows, obviously, for that

1987
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,800
to have the validation and ownership layer,

1988
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,040
so you can actually say, OK, now you really own it.

1989
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,640
But then there's a legal layer, which is contract law today.

1990
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:38,000
It's not treated the same way as owning a house for the time

1991
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,080
being, which I think, again, the UK and South Korea

1992
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:43,040
and some markets are looking at now, finally.

1993
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,160
Hong Kong's also started to do a working body that's

1994
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,320
thinking about digital property rights in the same vein

1995
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,040
as physical property rights.

1996
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:55,280
So I think that's an interesting evolution,

1997
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,280
because as we move towards everything

1998
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,240
towards decentralization, that means many of the things

1999
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,120
that become community governed, I actually

2000
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:07,080
think it will shift the world into an environment which

2001
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:08,920
will have problems with the shareholder capitalism

2002
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,160
into a form of stakeholder capitalism.

2003
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,800
And we're all already moving towards an environment

2004
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:16,360
where we're no longer just a customer consumer.

2005
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:17,960
We're a customer owner, which to me

2006
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,840
has incredible implications, right?

2007
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,400
Because the relationships that you have with a customer

2008
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,840
is deeper than just a consumer, someone who

2009
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:27,400
uses something and leaves.

2010
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:29,800
He becomes, it's not like a shareholder,

2011
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:30,840
but he's a stakeholder.

2012
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,400
He's part of the ecosystem.

2013
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:35,520
He shares arguably in the network effects

2014
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,840
and therefore in its joint success,

2015
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:38,880
but also suffers in the same way, right?

2016
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:44,040
Which is a different, let's call it,

2017
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,560
sort of a customer paradigm here as well.

2018
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,040
And maybe the other thing I would add

2019
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,520
is that there is maybe this is another one which I think

2020
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:52,160
is relevant.

2021
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,960
I'm not sure how many of your audience is based in Asia,

2022
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:56,680
but there's a very clear, I think,

2023
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,800
bifurcation right now, thanks to what

2024
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,920
happened with FTX between perspectives on crypto,

2025
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,120
between, let's call it, Asia and America in particular.

2026
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,800
Like I think in America, it's become more to more negative.

2027
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,480
I mean, I think it's short term, but still it's more negative.

2028
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:13,520
People are concerned.

2029
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,880
Whereas in Asia, it's full steam ahead.

2030
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,360
And we see the same thing, by the way,

2031
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:18,840
with Web3 games as well.

2032
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:21,000
Major Asian game companies, big ones as well,

2033
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,320
are embracing Web3.

2034
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,840
They're trying to figure it out, but they're embracing it.

2035
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,160
Whereas, again, major American game companies

2036
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,160
struggle with it.

2037
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:31,000
Not because they don't want to do it in some cases.

2038
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,320
They've said they're interested in this,

2039
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,080
but their customers are against it because of the fact

2040
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,520
that many Americans have become, I guess,

2041
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:44,440
more anti-capitalist or in leaning versus in Asia.

2042
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:49,960
The thing I sometimes say is that the American dream is

2043
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,880
more alive and well in Asia than it is in America.

2044
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:54,760
And people are more optimistic about the future

2045
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:56,520
of digital property rights.

2046
01:29:56,520 --> 01:30:00,560
And generally, the opportunities in this space and building.

2047
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,840
Hong Kong, for instance, just released their first Bitcoin

2048
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,080
ETF and Ethereum ETF just last week.

2049
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,640
And that's a big, big thing that the fifth or sixth largest

2050
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:13,360
stock exchange in the world is now

2051
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,280
trading retail crypto on a stock exchange.

2052
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,360
Well, the US is still trying to figure it out as an example.

2053
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,280
Japan, the prime minister, has made

2054
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:26,920
a web3 in the metaverse part of its national agenda

2055
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:31,440
and actually released an NFT white paper from the government.

2056
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,440
These are things that people don't know about that's

2057
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:36,440
happening in Asia, that is pushing the industry forward,

2058
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:41,480
that is often not spoken about in the West, which I think is

2059
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,800
probably worth learning about, and maybe also pushing.

2060
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,400
Because maybe people just feel comfortable that all innovation

2061
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:48,880
happens there.

2062
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,840
But actually, some really exciting things

2063
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,480
are happening in Asia that I think will help push

2064
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,160
forward the narrative of web3 in the open metaverse.

2065
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,880
Awesome.

2066
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,200
This was a great session.

2067
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,120
I think we could have gone like another hour and a half,

2068
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,080
and we'd still have things to talk about.

2069
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:06,920
Thank you.

2070
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,960
Thank you so much for joining the session.

2071
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:12,560
We'll release the video in the next day or two,

2072
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,880
and the transcript, and it will also be an NFT.

2073
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,760
So it will also be decentralized.

2074
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,440
And thank you all once again.

2075
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:25,400
And if we don't speak before now and then to the year,

2076
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,320
have a great rest of the year.

2077
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,560
Happy holidays, too.

2078
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:29,800
Thank you so much.

2079
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,320
OK.

2080
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:31,360
Bye-bye.

2081
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:58,720
Bye.
