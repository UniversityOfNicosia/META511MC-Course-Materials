00:00.000 --> 00:22.800
Hello, hi everyone,

00:22.800 --> 00:32.880
welcome to the seventh week of the University of Nicosia's free MOOC on NFTs and the Metaverse,

00:32.880 --> 00:40.720
this is George Giaglis and today our topic of discussion is going to be gaming NFTs,

00:40.720 --> 00:44.600
so we're going to be discussing gaming today.

00:44.600 --> 00:51.640
So today's session, I would dare say is sort of a bridging session because as you know,

00:51.640 --> 00:56.720
this is a 12-week course we've done, we've covered the first six weeks which were about

00:56.720 --> 00:57.720
NFTs,

00:57.720 --> 01:03.560
so we did an introduction and we saw the various use cases and application areas of non-fungible

01:03.560 --> 01:06.560
tokens.

01:06.560 --> 01:11.000
As of next week, we're going to move to the second part of the course which is more about

01:11.000 --> 01:12.960
Web3 and the Metaverse.

01:12.960 --> 01:20.400
And today's session is sort of transit or sort of trying to bridge these two areas in

01:20.400 --> 01:32.760
the sense that it is my personal feeling that many people will first experience the metaverse

01:32.760 --> 01:36.200
through some sort of a game,

01:36.200 --> 01:41.200
so I'd like to spend some time today discussing the various types of games, the history of

01:41.200 --> 01:51.760
gaming, how do NFTs fit with a future of gaming and how these could facilitate the transition

01:51.760 --> 02:00.200
to a more immersive, more persistent digital experience for everyone, what we usually define

02:00.200 --> 02:03.200
as the metaverse.

02:03.200 --> 02:09.120
So we will start by going through a short history of video games, and how it all started,

02:09.120 --> 02:14.800
and I'm not going to, it's totally impossible to cover everything of course, but I'll try

02:14.800 --> 02:26.760
to go through the major milestones trying to give you a perspective in the sense that

02:26.760 --> 02:33.400
where we are today and where we're probably heading tomorrow in terms of our gaming experiences

02:33.400 --> 02:40.240
is something that is very compatible with what has happened so far and although we might

02:40.240 --> 02:46.920
sometimes tend to think of blockchains and NFTs as a hugely disruptive experiences, I think

02:46.920 --> 02:51.760
it's somehow the natural next step in the evolution of gaming.

02:51.760 --> 02:58.480
We'll discuss a little bit the process of creating games, not because I'm going to turn

02:58.480 --> 03:04.880
any of you into gaming designer production experts, again, we cannot do this in the short

03:04.880 --> 03:10.520
time of one session, but because I think it is important to understand the various dimensions

03:10.520 --> 03:19.280
so that we can see why existing blockchain-based games and why existing gaming NFTs have still

03:19.280 --> 03:22.640
not managed to live up to their expectations,

03:22.640 --> 03:30.000
so the complexities and intricacies of the process of creating games make it quite difficult.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000
We will discuss the main types of benefits that blockchains bring into gaming, namely

03:39.000 --> 03:45.440
the ability to facilitate real ownership of game assets for the players, the ability

03:45.440 --> 03:54.600
to transfer assets between games and to create an interoperable in-game or across-game economy.

03:54.600 --> 04:03.960
We'll discuss it a little bit later again, not trying to do an exhaustive review.

04:03.960 --> 04:10.400
This is everything that we're discussing are still phenomenal that is under development,

04:10.400 --> 04:19.160
so we're just going to see where we are today and what the potential next steps might be

04:19.160 --> 04:24.600
and maybe talk a little bit about the size of the market in-game.

04:24.600 --> 04:30.600
As usual, our disclaimer, this is educational material only, so although I will be referencing

04:30.600 --> 04:38.200
a number of projects in this presentation, none of them is included for anything else

04:38.200 --> 04:43.400
apart from as an indicative example for educational purposes.

04:43.400 --> 04:50.640
So please do your own research if you decide to delve more in-depth into any of the projects

04:50.640 --> 04:53.200
that are mentioned in this course.

04:53.200 --> 04:59.400
So, let's start with the first argument that I'd like to make.

04:59.400 --> 05:06.760
The argument, as I've said, is that games can be thought of as very early examples of

05:06.760 --> 05:07.760
Metaverses,

05:07.760 --> 05:12.280
so those of you in the audience that are already gamers know what I'm talking about

05:12.280 --> 05:21.960
because you know that many of the MMORPGs that exist out there look and feel like what

05:21.960 --> 05:25.160
most of us think about as the Metaverse.

05:25.160 --> 05:32.680
Obviously, with a very specific setting of the virtual world and a very specific objective

05:32.680 --> 05:38.800
and gameplay and the types of things that are happening are not like a virtual world

05:38.800 --> 05:44.400
as a whole is a very specific, narrow virtual world, but a virtual world nevertheless,

05:44.400 --> 05:49.600
so I think as I've said that games can be thought of as proton Metaverse, so very

05:49.600 --> 05:56.640
early examples of a Metaverse and I think many of us are going to experience the Metaverse

05:56.640 --> 06:00.440
through games.

06:00.440 --> 06:03.040
I like this definition of what a game is,

06:03.040 --> 06:08.440
I'm not really sure that we need the definition, but nevertheless, it's always good to start

06:08.440 --> 06:09.440
with a common perspective.

06:09.440 --> 06:15.320
A game is an interactive experience, so it's something that is between players or between

06:15.320 --> 06:21.760
a player and a computer and is an experience that provides a player with an increasingly

06:21.760 --> 06:26.680
the challenging sequence of patterns which the player learns and eventually masters,

06:26.680 --> 06:37.480
so most of the games will make the player go through a series of steps, tasks, challenges

06:37.480 --> 06:47.240
or whatever that are of increasing difficulty until either the player loses or the game

06:47.240 --> 06:54.960
concludes with some successful and some games have an objective, others you still continue

06:54.960 --> 07:02.040
playing for as long as you can and there's never a natural finish and successful finish

07:02.040 --> 07:04.760
to the game.

07:04.760 --> 07:14.560
So according to this definition, you can think of video games as having three main components.

07:14.560 --> 07:19.280
One is a user interface, so the player needs to somehow interact with the game, and usually

07:19.280 --> 07:25.760
this would happen through a console, a joystick, a controller, or some sort of motion sensing

07:25.760 --> 07:29.120
device or what have you.

07:29.120 --> 07:36.360
There needs to be a video display device early on, it might be our TV, now a computer monitor,

07:36.360 --> 07:41.560
tomorrow maybe a virtual reality headset, but there needs to be something that shows

07:41.560 --> 07:50.000
us the virtual world through which we traverse while we're playing the game and there needs

07:50.000 --> 07:54.320
to be a storyline, there needs to be a setting, there needs to be a context, there needs to

07:54.320 --> 08:00.520
be a virtual world in which the action of the game takes place and if you think about

08:00.520 --> 08:06.680
it, the combination of these three things, so having a virtual world out there, a virtual

08:06.680 --> 08:13.440
the world that is displayed in some sort of output device which could be immersive, it could be

08:13.440 --> 08:15.360
a virtual reality headset.

08:15.360 --> 08:22.600
The last ability to interact, live and do things within this world sounds a bit like what the

08:22.600 --> 08:27.520
metaverse would be about, I mean we'll formally define the metaverse next week, but I think

08:27.520 --> 08:35.680
most of us would agree that a virtual world in which we exist as a character and do things

08:35.680 --> 08:41.880
and receive feedback and interact with other players or with the virtual world is what

08:41.880 --> 08:46.040
a metaverse is all about, that's why I'm saying that video games can be thought

08:46.040 --> 08:51.440
of as sort of metaverse type of experiences.

08:51.440 --> 08:59.240
The history of video games is quite old, I mean beginning of the 70s with things like

08:59.240 --> 09:07.640
Zolk, for those of you that are into text-based, a bunch of games or with arcades like punk

09:07.640 --> 09:16.240
which was the first ping pong-themed arcade game and you see here on the right the type

09:16.240 --> 09:22.880
of the game that I'm talking about, but remember this is 1972, we're 10 years before the introduction

09:22.880 --> 09:33.520
of the personal computer, so this is a very, very proto type of experience in an arcade

09:33.520 --> 09:43.920
type of interface where you have very simple two-dimensional graphics effectively, two

09:43.920 --> 09:50.760
players or one player and the computer, is controlling a dash that moves up and down

09:50.760 --> 09:56.760
the screen and there's a ball moving in between if you might not cut the ball and throw

09:56.760 --> 10:03.640
it to your opponent, then the game continues, if you don't then you lose a point and this

10:03.640 --> 10:07.600
is how it all goes.

10:07.600 --> 10:16.920
Pong was developed by Atari, one of the very famous gaming computer developers of the 70s

10:16.920 --> 10:25.560
and the 80s, Atari has a very special place in my heart along with the Commodore and the

10:25.560 --> 10:29.720
ZX Spectrum and all these computers because these were the first types of computers that

10:29.720 --> 10:39.440
I interacted with, so Atari is a legend in the early computer gaming era, Pong was a

10:39.440 --> 10:44.760
very interesting game, it was created by a guy called Allan Alcorn and it was not created

10:44.760 --> 10:50.320
to be a commercial game, it was created as a training exercise given to Allan by his boss,

10:50.320 --> 10:59.000
one of the Atari's co-founder Nolan Bushnell, so Allan did such a great job that Atari thought,

10:59.000 --> 11:06.280
wow, we gave this as an exercise but there's probably an opportunity here to commercialize

11:06.280 --> 11:12.320
this, so they did and they commercialized it like this, when we're talking about games

11:12.320 --> 11:18.760
in the 70s, this is the setting that we're talking about, stand-alone, special made,

11:18.760 --> 11:26.480
you know, whole 'cupboards' that included a screen and they, and some controls as you can see

11:26.480 --> 11:31.120
here on the left there are two controls for the two players that are playing Pong and

11:31.120 --> 11:40.080
there's a coin-inserting machine, so you would go to a mall, to a supermarket, to a shop that

11:40.080 --> 11:45.480
had arcade games and you would play this game for money, there were no computers, there were

11:45.480 --> 11:55.640
no, there was no way in which you could do this at home, the big revolution and the big

11:55.640 --> 12:03.600
advancement in gaming was when we made the transition from arcade consoles, so when computer

12:03.600 --> 12:09.920
games started the kind of home entertainment again from the 1970s, you can see on the right

12:09.920 --> 12:14.600
a picture of two kids playing the same game, this is Pong now, but now they're playing

12:14.600 --> 12:24.880
it at home in a console that is connected to the home computer.

12:24.880 --> 12:33.240
This, the fact that games entered our homes created an explosion in the types of games,

12:33.240 --> 12:41.960
so there are, I mean, nearly countless genres of the game today, games would most typically

12:41.960 --> 12:48.120
be categorized according to the interaction and the game place will have adventure games

12:48.120 --> 12:54.360
or fighting games or puzzle games or shooter games or sports and so on.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.800
And another big distinction is whether we're talking about first-person or third person

12:58.800 --> 13:10.680
games, so like the picture that you see there on your left, you are the character holding

13:10.680 --> 13:18.280
the machine gun but you never see your actual avatar, you never see your character, the

13:18.280 --> 13:22.920
the whole world revolves around your own point of view.

13:22.920 --> 13:28.600
In the third person games like the example we see on the right, you control a character

13:28.600 --> 13:36.000
that you can see in front of you and you see how he or she might interact with their environment.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.760
Another way of classifying games could be according to their dimensionality, so we'll

13:40.760 --> 13:48.920
have 2D games, the early examples of games where we like have very crude graphics both

13:48.920 --> 13:55.240
for the avatars and for the surrounding world, so Super Mario as you can see there on the

13:55.240 --> 14:01.160
left is an example of such a game and I'm not trying here to make an argument that says

14:01.160 --> 14:07.720
that two-dimensional games are worse than 3D games, they are just older and there's

14:07.720 --> 14:14.920
a different type of modality of interacting with a virtual world and I'm saying this

14:14.920 --> 14:27.880
because I might be proven wrong here but contrary to what most people expect or predict, I think

14:27.880 --> 14:36.080
there's going to be a sizable market for metaverses in the beginning at least of the commercial

14:36.080 --> 14:44.000
era of the metaverse where the world around us would be deliberately simple, so everything

14:44.000 --> 14:52.640
in a computer is a model of reality and we can decide what type of abstraction we want

14:52.640 --> 14:59.360
to have against that reality, so many designers and producers and providers and then users

14:59.360 --> 15:09.560
I think would choose to go to simpler models where they can focus more on the social interaction

15:09.560 --> 15:18.760
rather than be consumed by the elaborate details of the worlds around them but that's one possible

15:18.760 --> 15:27.880
direction and some people will take that path, others might choose to go to a more realistic,

15:27.880 --> 15:34.480
photorealistic I mean games, so we have 3D games now like the most you see on your right

15:34.480 --> 15:40.840
where your view of the world is essentially a 3D camera perspective, either first person

15:40.840 --> 15:49.600
or third person as we discussed and there are some games in between these two like the

15:49.600 --> 15:57.120
payments from the middle from Wolfenstein which was the first game that popularized the shooting

15:57.120 --> 16:09.400
games, a genre where there was a sort of a pseudo 3D environment in the sense that everything

16:09.400 --> 16:19.520
was in reality 2D, there were no 3D models there but the use of two-dimensional sprites

16:19.520 --> 16:28.400
creating the impression to users that they were seeing a 3-dimensional world. Now the

16:28.400 --> 16:35.320
most important distinction of games and most important for the purposes of this lecture

16:35.320 --> 16:44.800
because again trying to make a point that would lead us to NFTs and Web3 is that most

16:44.800 --> 16:53.480
video games would be classified as what we call RPGs like Role Playing Games in the sense

16:53.480 --> 16:59.760
that when you play the game you assume the role of a character and you take control of

16:59.760 --> 17:08.080
the actions of that character, so most of video games are RPGs. One sub-gender of

17:08.080 --> 17:14.720
RPGs that became popular especially in the 80s and beginning of 90s, was what we would

17:14.720 --> 17:24.080
call multi-user dimension, originally it was called multi-user dungeon or multi-user domain

17:24.080 --> 17:29.920
games, it became popular with the art from the MUD anyway. Dungeon because it started

17:29.920 --> 17:35.960
from adventure games that used to take place in the worlds characterised by dungeons

17:35.960 --> 17:44.640
and the distinguishing characteristic of these games was that they were typically text-based

17:44.640 --> 17:50.440
or storyboarded. So there were no elaborate graphics, and sometimes there were no graphics

17:50.440 --> 17:57.480
at all, a player would enter a world that was usually fantasy or science fiction inspired

17:57.480 --> 18:04.720
world and they would receive text-based descriptions. So you are now in the forest you see you know

18:04.720 --> 18:11.040
housing front of you, this was typical like the introduction to Zork, one of the first text

18:11.040 --> 18:16.600
based adventure games but the distinguishing characteristic of MUDs was that they were

18:16.600 --> 18:23.800
multi-player, there were many players that could play the game at the same time and they could

18:23.800 --> 18:30.160
have either an adversarial or a collaborative relationship between them depending on the

18:30.160 --> 18:37.520
game and how it works, so sometimes you would know be there to kill other players or

18:37.520 --> 18:45.840
to cooperate with them in order to achieve some objective and this sounds sort of like,

18:45.840 --> 18:52.680
you know, trivial today but it was far from trivial back then, the ability to create worlds

18:52.680 --> 19:01.320
that would accommodate many users. So MUD types of games were the first games

19:01.320 --> 19:08.320
that created an internet type of experience for the users back then in the early 90s, many

19:08.320 --> 19:15.000
people back then discovered what we call today the internet so a worldwide connected network

19:15.000 --> 19:20.720
of computers through playing such kinds of games but because of you know bandwidth or

19:20.720 --> 19:28.120
technology limitations these games were usually very limited in terms of their graphical interfaces.

19:28.120 --> 19:37.920
Now, RPGs and MUDs came together and evolved into what today we would call MMORPGs or massively

19:37.920 --> 19:43.360
multiplayer online the wrong playing games which are video games here we're talking now

19:43.360 --> 19:51.240
about virtual worlds that have you know a very significant graphical interface sometimes

19:51.240 --> 19:59.120
with a very high degree of photorealism and allow a massive number of players I mean I'm

19:59.120 --> 20:10.680
talking in the range of even millions of players to play the game at the same time. Another

20:10.680 --> 20:16.600
distinguishing characteristic of these games and this characteristic that is very important

20:16.600 --> 20:24.360
for us is that these games feature what we would call persistent worlds, in other words

20:24.360 --> 20:32.040
we're talking about games where if you as a player stop playing the game the game still

20:32.040 --> 20:37.680
continues to exist, other players are there, the world evolves, things happen, so next time

20:37.680 --> 20:42.880
you go back online you might find a very different environment because things have happened while

20:42.880 --> 20:48.280
you were away and this is something that, okay for the younger people here that you know the

20:48.280 --> 20:56.080
first types of games that they got used to were MMORPGs might sound like a natural thing but

20:56.080 --> 21:03.440
for us it's a total revolution it was a total revolution because previous types of games

21:03.440 --> 21:10.800
existed only as far as long as I was playing them the moment that I stopped playing the

21:10.800 --> 21:17.400
game when you know I got offline or when I got the game over sign the game didn't exist

21:17.400 --> 21:23.600
there the world stopped existing it came into existence and it stopped being there when

21:23.600 --> 21:29.840
I entered and when I stopped playing the game. MMORPGs are the first example of persistent

21:29.840 --> 21:37.560
worlds and as we will be discussing next week because persistence is a very important defining

21:37.560 --> 21:44.280
characteristic of the metaverse, I would say that you know most early metaverses

21:44.280 --> 21:50.400
is that we will say enjoying some type of real commercial success in the sense of having

21:50.400 --> 21:58.600
many users in them will feature some sort of game-like persistence in the experience of

21:58.600 --> 22:09.560
the users. Now these games have become hugely popular those of you that play such games

22:09.560 --> 22:15.280
know that already for those of you that you know all these are new there are games like

22:15.280 --> 22:22.600
World of Warcraft where the total player count of people that have accounts play that game are,

22:22.600 --> 22:28.840
like you know, in the in the hundreds of millions and there might be more than a million people

22:28.840 --> 22:35.520
playing the game at the same time around the world so we're talking about really really

22:35.520 --> 22:43.200
popular really successful and mass-adopted games in the respective communities

22:43.200 --> 22:50.280
and this has resulted naturally in gaming being a huge industry, I mean I come 

22:50.280 --> 23:01.960
from a blockchain and crypto type of background into this course so for me, the fact

23:01.960 --> 23:09.800
that the whole crypto industry is worth around a trillion is, mind-blowingly

23:09.800 --> 23:16.360
hugely successful but we're talking here about an industry in which the

23:16.360 --> 23:23.320
number of cryptocurrency users are measured in the hundreds of thousands of millions

23:23.320 --> 23:29.520
around the world, here we're talking about an industry in which almost half the world more

23:29.520 --> 23:35.400
than 3.2 billion people worldwide play some sort of computer game, many of these people

23:35.400 --> 23:46.880
play MMORPGs but not only that and there's a very aggressively growing e-sport industry

23:46.880 --> 23:56.040
where the audiences have grown to more than half a billion people in 2022 so you think

23:56.040 --> 24:04.040
about it, almost one in every two persons in the whole world are playing games and around one

24:04.040 --> 24:12.120
in sixteen people are watching video games being played competitively by other players so this is

24:12.120 --> 24:20.040
a huge industry and if it somehow makes the transition to Web3 it's going to be

24:20.040 --> 24:28.440
a killer app for blockchains, for Web3 and for NFTs in general. The global gaming

24:28.440 --> 24:34.920
market is projected to be worth more than 250 billion dollars by 2025 so we're talking about a huge

24:35.560 --> 24:44.200
industry, there's console based marketplaces where you can get games like Nintendo,

24:44.200 --> 24:52.280
PlayStation or Microsoft Xbox and stuff like that, a whole industry of course in mobile games, iOS,

24:52.280 --> 25:00.520
Google Play for Andriod and so on, a huge number of websites and a huge number of platforms

25:00.520 --> 25:10.920
that provide access to gaming to desktop computers of which I think Steam is the largest, they support

25:10.920 --> 25:21.240
around 70,000 gaming titles. The industry is huge and being dominated by players that come from all

25:21.240 --> 25:28.360
backgrounds so you see technology companies like Microsoft, you see consumer electronics

25:28.360 --> 25:38.840
companies like Sony, you see game studios like electronic cards and games like Rob

25:38.840 --> 25:47.000
Blocks being in the top 10 of the gaming industry and you see the top 10 companies have

25:47.000 --> 25:55.000
market caps that range from tens of billions of dollars to, okay Microsoft has a huge market

25:55.000 --> 26:01.880
cap but it's not only gaming, so we're talking about a very very big industry that might make

26:01.880 --> 26:10.120
the transition towards Web3 in the coming years. Now this was a very quick introduction

26:10.120 --> 26:17.800
to the history of gaming and how we have arrived where we are today with NFT games but before

26:17.800 --> 26:24.920
discussing this I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing game development. So

26:27.240 --> 26:35.560
the games that you saw a couple of static images from in the previous slides like

26:35.560 --> 26:42.360
world of Warcraft or Minecraft or similar types of games are very very complex competitive

26:42.360 --> 26:51.160
projects to develop, they need huge teams of engineers, of artists, of designers and of

26:51.160 --> 26:58.920
producers to be coordinated and to be able to create something that is not a one off thing,

26:58.920 --> 27:05.400
it's not like a Hollywood movie where you might also need a similar type of

27:05.400 --> 27:10.680
array of people coming together and coordinating themselves for a limited amount of time until

27:10.680 --> 27:19.320
the movie gets out to theaters and then that's it, here we're talking about an ongoing process

27:19.320 --> 27:27.000
of always improving, developing and evolving the game while the game is being played

27:27.000 --> 27:34.120
and especially in the case of MMORPGs you need to be able to deploy

27:34.120 --> 27:40.280
upgrades in real time while millions of people are using the product so we're talking about a very

27:40.280 --> 27:49.320
complex and there go and I'm saying this because I want you and I want people like me

27:49.320 --> 27:59.480
also to be a bit lenient when it comes to judging the gameplay, the design and the general

27:59.480 --> 28:06.280
complexity and sophistication of blockchain-based games that we see around us because we're

28:06.280 --> 28:14.520
trying to compare what huge companies with billions of dollars of market cap and thousands of employees

28:14.520 --> 28:24.920
are able to produce after 10 or 15 years in the industry, with what a team of five

28:24.920 --> 28:31.960
or ten start-upers might be doing in a whole new technology with whole new types of assets like

28:31.960 --> 28:37.240
fans of the lot non-fungible tokens and sometimes I see reports saying, yeah but none of

28:37.240 --> 28:46.440
these games are fun to play or sophisticated enough or whatever what do you expect did you

28:46.440 --> 28:55.000
expect that you know a team of people that have just released a game that there's no

28:56.520 --> 29:03.640
trodden path and there's no prior learning or whatever would be able to achieve anything close

29:03.640 --> 29:12.440
to what a very sophisticated professional public company making billions of dollars is

29:12.440 --> 29:24.040
producing, I mean, it's sort of expected that you would see the types of games that we see in the

29:24.040 --> 29:29.080
in the blockchain and the crypto world today. So anyway, coming back to the team you would need

29:29.080 --> 29:34.600
engineers obviously and not only people that would actually code and program the software but

29:34.600 --> 29:39.400
especially when we're talking about console-based games, also people that would design and

29:39.400 --> 29:49.000
manufacture and integrate the hardware on which the software will be running, you would need a huge

29:49.000 --> 29:54.280
array of artists because you would need people that would define the concept, what is the game

29:54.280 --> 29:58.920
vision of the storyline and everything, you would need people that would do the 3D modeling

29:58.920 --> 30:05.080
of everything within the virtual world, the environment, the characters, the assets you would

30:05.080 --> 30:13.960
need texture artists that would add textures and details to the 3D models created by the

30:13.960 --> 30:20.200
modulus, you would need people that would spend their time working on lighting and motion capture

30:20.200 --> 30:29.000
and sound and all these things. If you attended and watched the discussion of (Punk) 6529 
30:29.000 --> 30:38.120
with Beeple the other day you might remember how much time and energy Beeple was

30:38.840 --> 30:44.520
telling us that he was he's spending when he's creating his digital art, not in actual

30:44.520 --> 30:53.400
modeling or customizing the models that he started working from but actually is sculpting or

30:53.400 --> 31:01.960
photographing or playing with the lighting around these objects that he creates. So you will

31:01.960 --> 31:07.800
need designers, you will need people to design the mechanics of the gameplay, to design the modalities

31:07.800 --> 31:12.440
of player interaction and so forth and you need a production team that would actually bring

31:12.440 --> 31:18.200
everything together would deal with this as a project with specific milestones and

31:18.200 --> 31:26.040
deadlines and phases and what have you, and they was they would liaise with the business units

31:26.040 --> 31:34.360
that would commercialize or market or sell the game, so we're talking about very big teams and

31:34.360 --> 31:42.120
that's why sometimes we make distinctions between what we call indie and AAA games so there are

31:42.120 --> 31:48.200
publishers that can afford having all these things and they are like they're the Hollywood type of

31:51.320 --> 31:58.120
of actors in the gaming industry and there are indies so an indie game would be produced by an

31:58.120 --> 32:05.080
independent studio or a small number of individuals and this is all the games in the blockchain

32:05.080 --> 32:13.320
world, I guess. I spoke about mechanics so the mechanics of the gameplay is a very very important

32:13.320 --> 32:20.760
thing because it defines all the rules and procedures that guide the player and they also dictate what

32:20.760 --> 32:28.360
the game responses to the player's moves or actions can be; an interesting thought here is that

32:28.360 --> 32:38.280
many/most of the games that we have today, in order to not confuse the player or not

32:40.120 --> 32:47.960
create a steep learning curve for a new player, try to adhere to the laws of physics so you

32:47.960 --> 32:54.360
know when you leave an object in the game it will fall down you know pulled by gravity as it would

32:54.360 --> 33:02.120
in the physical world however, you understand of course that there is no reason for this to happen

33:02.120 --> 33:11.480
in the digital world, we are free from all these constraints so in the metaverse sphere I would

33:11.480 --> 33:22.440
expect that we would see some very original or experimental modalities regarding game mechanics

33:22.440 --> 33:32.840
or world function mechanics where the world would not necessarily work as it does in the physical

33:32.840 --> 33:40.280
world, so we might you know free ourselves from the limitations of the physical world in these environments.

33:41.880 --> 33:49.000
Another important aspect is creating assets and here you would need to have access to

33:49.000 --> 33:57.480
quite sophisticated software for 3D modeling either to create characters as you see in the picture

33:58.360 --> 34:03.320
in the top of the screen which is I think from blender one of 

34:06.520 --> 34:15.480
the open source types of software for 3D modeling all creating the details like the last

34:15.480 --> 34:21.880
and best practices in the machine gun that you see in the image below which is from

34:21.880 --> 34:31.480
a map software I think is from 3D Studio Mark so you would need to have all these things to create

34:31.480 --> 34:40.200
assets and here I'm still talking about design and creating the assets you would need to enrich the

34:40.200 --> 34:50.120
assets that come from your 3D modeling software and you usually start from some sort of mathematical

34:50.120 --> 34:56.760
polygonal type of structure to create and add texture and details and lightning and stuff like

34:56.760 --> 35:05.960
that on top of this and all this work is still to create the asset itself which could be part

35:05.960 --> 35:12.440
of the virtual world, could be a playing character, it could be a non-playing character within a game,

35:12.440 --> 35:23.880
it could be a weapon or a shield or a uniform or you name it, and has nothing to do with the actual

35:23.880 --> 35:30.760
gameplay and ownership and transferability and where you would be able to find and how you would

35:30.760 --> 35:38.200
be able to sell or swap or trade these types of assets, so the learning outcome here is that

35:38.200 --> 35:46.680
creating a sophisticated competitive game is a very very competitive process. There are there 

35:46.680 --> 35:53.160
a number of game engines so there are a number of software environments that can be used to

35:53.160 --> 36:01.960
allow game designers to bring everything together so 3D modeling gameplay mechanics as a creation

36:02.600 --> 36:09.400
interaction between players and non-playing characters and so on, examples are the unreal engine

36:09.400 --> 36:19.160
or unity or cryogen that you see here in this slide and there is also a huge body of work in

36:19.160 --> 36:33.080
developing standardized libraries for APIs and software interfaces for either 3D graphics

36:33.080 --> 36:42.840
processing hardware like your GPUs in your computer, like OpenGL and WebGL or more proprietary types

36:42.840 --> 36:49.880
of APIs like DirectX by Microsoft for those that are programming games on Microsoft platforms.

36:51.800 --> 36:56.200
Now having said all this and I understand that this is a very very

36:56.840 --> 37:05.160
quick and shallow introduction to the technologies and processes around game creation

37:05.160 --> 37:10.680
I would like to focus the remainder of our time on what we're interested in today, like

37:10.680 --> 37:17.240
what happens when the technology of blockchain when cryptocurrency when fungible tokens and non-fungiable tokens (NFTs) 

37:17.240 --> 37:25.640
meet gaming, how might we see the future of gaming through this

37:25.640 --> 37:33.640
this lens and as I've said in the beginning I think that there are three major

37:33.640 --> 37:49.320
types of implications that blockchain will have in gaming, blockchain being a technology that allows

37:50.040 --> 37:58.440
for value creation storage and transfer over computer networks, I think it will have a substantial

37:58.440 --> 38:06.520
effect on gaming because it will provide a much-needed layer for storing and transferring value

38:06.520 --> 38:14.600
in gaming and I think there are three things there, one is asset ownership so who owns the assets

38:15.320 --> 38:22.760
in a game, there's this famous story that Vitalik Butterin thought of a non-centralized Ethereum

38:22.760 --> 38:32.680
when I don't remember which game he was playing but they deprived him of one of the weapons

38:32.680 --> 38:42.600
or sheilds that he had managed to earn by playing the game and he realized that although

38:42.600 --> 38:49.800
he thought that because this was in his inventory it was his it was actually not there was not, there's

38:49.800 --> 38:55.320
no real ownership of your character, your avatar, your asset, your weaponry or whatever when you're

38:55.320 --> 39:00.920
playing a game, everything is being controlled centrally by the game provider so if they want

39:00.920 --> 39:06.360
they can throw you out of the game they can, 

39:09.320 --> 39:11.240
block your account or they can

39:11.240 --> 39:21.160
deprive you of any asset that you might have had so blockchain will change all that

39:21.160 --> 39:28.280
because it would allow people to actually really own their assets that they use in the games and

39:28.280 --> 39:36.200
when I say really own I mean they would have the ability to not only trade them with other users

39:36.200 --> 39:45.240
but also do that and many other things outside of the game, so when you are when you have the asset

39:45.240 --> 39:53.240
in your wallet as an NFT, you might use it in this particular game but the asset becomes also interoperable,

39:53.240 --> 39:59.240
it can be used in other things so for example many of you have minted the course access token

39:59.240 --> 40:05.000
for UNIC, this is a token that give you access to some of the material for the course and certainly

40:05.000 --> 40:13.160
the exams so it's a token that helps utility within the ecosystem of this course but nothing

40:13.160 --> 40:20.120
stops someone from creating some other experience which could be educational, a game or what have

40:20.120 --> 40:29.240
you and have this experience token gated controlled and affected by the ownership of this token

40:29.240 --> 40:36.040
so have created something that is accessible only by people who happen to have this asset on their

40:36.600 --> 40:45.320
wallet so assets become more important than the games themselves, I don't know how many of you

40:45.880 --> 40:55.240
are familiar with projects like Loot (for Adventurers) or the N Project in the NFT

40:55.240 --> 41:03.480
space but both these projects and many others have flipped the idea of a game

41:04.680 --> 41:12.520
on its head and they said why should we create a game and have assets only within this game

41:12.520 --> 41:20.280
and not create the assets first, so create a set of weaponry and

41:20.280 --> 41:27.400
shields and shoes and helmets and so on with different powers and different degrees of rarity

41:28.040 --> 41:36.840
and aesthetics and so on and let everyone use the collection of these, this becomes an NFT

41:36.840 --> 41:44.520
collection of assets in the games or arts or experiences that they create, so we're talking

41:44.520 --> 41:54.440
about a wholly different perspective on how we view games if we have blockchain-enabled NFTs as

41:54.440 --> 42:04.840
assets in them. And the final the effect of blockchain into gaming is the ability to create

42:04.840 --> 42:11.800
in-game and sometimes (hopefully in the future) across game economies, so create whole economic

42:11.800 --> 42:21.640
structures with supply and demand dynamics in which value is distributed to users and controlled

42:21.640 --> 42:31.640
by the users within the game and not monopolized by the platform creating the game itself. So again

42:31.640 --> 42:39.880
NFTs allow for true digital ownership for game assets so if you hold your character or

42:39.880 --> 42:47.080
avatar as an NFT you are the real owner it cannot be taken away from you any asset that you buy

42:47.080 --> 42:53.720
or you collect while playing the game can also be an NFT and then you can swap or trade with other

42:53.720 --> 43:00.600
players without any intermediaries and without any possible censorship by the game owner and they

43:00.600 --> 43:06.360
can also exist as I've said outside the game as independent entities that might have other

43:06.360 --> 43:12.600
users or internal values so the collection of these four properties that you see in this slide

43:13.240 --> 43:23.160
create a revolutionary, I would dare say, environment on how assets in games can be thought of that

43:23.160 --> 43:29.640
was simply not possible in the pre-blockchain world even in the MMORPG era.

43:29.640 --> 43:38.360
This has created a number of experiments, one of them that I'd like to spend a few minutes

43:38.360 --> 43:46.600
discussing because it has received quite some attention by the community (at least the blockchain

43:46.600 --> 43:55.320
community) is the so-called played-win games so as the names suggest these are games in which

43:55.320 --> 44:05.080
the economics go to the next level because they allow their players to play the game for some sort

44:05.080 --> 44:16.280
of a financial gain. Not in the sense of gaining from other players so like betting and battling

44:16.280 --> 44:22.840
and whoever wins takes the money and wins the bet but in the sense of creating adding value,

44:22.840 --> 44:30.280
creating new value that is created by playing the game itself. There are typically two broad

44:30.280 --> 44:35.400
categories, those that are called "free-to-play" games, so you you can start playing the

44:35.400 --> 44:42.280
game for free although if you do that you most probably will be limited in your ability to

44:42.280 --> 44:49.800
to gain money from playing it, or, the so-called "pay-to-play" games in the sense that users will need to be

44:49.800 --> 44:56.920
equipped by some sort of NFT so you would need to get an avatar or weapons or your shoes or whatever

44:57.560 --> 45:02.120
so you need to buy NFTs you need to invest in the game in the beginning and once you've made

45:02.120 --> 45:09.720
that investment, depending on how good you are in the game and how powerful or rare the properties

45:09.720 --> 45:17.480
of your NFTs are, you might earn money usually in the form of some digital tokens which has fluctuating

45:17.480 --> 45:27.000
value so whether these games would be able to create sustaining economies is a different

45:27.000 --> 45:34.360
question that we're going to see in a while. Typically in such games players will be able to create

45:34.360 --> 45:40.360
or breed new characters so you would be able to you know literally breed your characters and create

45:40.360 --> 45:46.600
new ones that you can either use for playing or sell in the marketplace, you would be able to purchase

45:46.600 --> 45:53.000
items either within the game or in third-party marketplaces and you would typically be able to

45:53.000 --> 46:00.520
unlock or earn additional digital assets or tokens by playing the game depending on how long

46:00.520 --> 46:08.520
you played or how good you are at it and so on. The archetypal example here is actually infinity,

46:08.520 --> 46:15.720
I'm not going to spend so much time on it because I think it's old news now but I don't

46:15.720 --> 46:23.320
think any discussion about "play-to-earn" would be complete without discussing. Actually because it

46:23.320 --> 46:29.400
was the first game that became hugely successful I mean at some point a year or a year and a half

46:29.400 --> 46:36.840
ago there were lots of people, especially in countries like the Philippines where it was

46:36.840 --> 46:42.440
extremely popular but were actually doing it as their job, they were making money by

46:42.440 --> 46:50.680
playing the game. What is typical about Axie is that they pioneered this dual token structure so

46:50.680 --> 46:58.840
these games usually have more than one type of tokens so they have both fungible and non-fungible

46:58.840 --> 47:07.400
tokens and the fungible tokens usually are split between a governance token in the case of Axie

47:07.400 --> 47:15.400
Infinity it's the Axie Infinity Shard and the AXS token and a utility token in the case of Axie Gold Smooth

47:15.400 --> 47:23.080
(I thought the small anyway smooth or small) love potion the SLP token which is the

47:23.080 --> 47:32.200
reward token or the utility token that people would earn and there's also NFT tokens in the

47:32.200 --> 47:39.800
the case of Axie the playing characters are NFTs the Axie themselves as well as tokenized lots of

47:39.800 --> 47:47.480
land that act as forms or basis of operation for the activity. The game is about battling

47:47.480 --> 47:55.880
with with other opponents your Axie against them so it's mostly a card-based game in which

47:55.880 --> 48:04.680
players playing Terrence is not very interactive. There are a number of games that have been developed

48:04.680 --> 48:11.720
following on the same or similar ideas. I have just some indicators examples here so Alien

48:11.720 --> 48:20.120
Worlds or Galaxy Fight Club or Gods Unchained they are I would dare say and forgive me because it's a

48:20.120 --> 48:27.880
very simplistic type of description and maybe unfair to them they are advanced versions of Axie

48:27.880 --> 48:36.680
infinity in the sense that they follow a similar trajectory in terms of creating environments in

48:36.680 --> 48:44.280
which characters fight or battle each other and players might make money if they

48:44.280 --> 48:53.240
win against their opponents. A different Sam Zendre is the one in the bottom,

48:54.360 --> 48:59.800
projects like Stepping or Genopets which are what we would call "move-to-earn"

49:01.080 --> 49:10.040
games in the sense that they would reward users for their daily movements so the more that you

49:10.040 --> 49:15.400
walk or run or in the case of Genopets is much more complicated because you have

49:15.960 --> 49:22.360
this virtual pet so on top of banking steps you might do other things it's

49:22.920 --> 49:30.920
more move-to-earm and plat-to-earm type of game but all of them (or most of them) have the same

49:30.920 --> 49:37.880
basic underlying economic structure in the sense that there are a number of NFTs so in the Galaxy

49:37.880 --> 49:45.480
Fight Club you have your fighter and you have weapons that this fighter is equipped to

49:45.480 --> 49:51.960
and depending on you know what type of fighter or what type of weapon you might have different

49:51.960 --> 49:59.480
abilities in battle and so the outcome of the game would be a combination of your skills combined with

50:00.520 --> 50:06.840
the types of assets that you own. In the case of Stepping how much money you would make

50:06.840 --> 50:14.600
would depend on a combination of factors like you what type of shoe you have (so this is an

50:14.600 --> 50:24.920
NFT) what type of added properties you have equipped these shoe with and different shoes have different

50:24.920 --> 50:32.200
properties and these properties have different values so for different uses there are different

50:32.200 --> 50:42.120
optimal configurations of your shoes so quite complicated but at the same time this

50:42.920 --> 50:51.720
complication might increase the joy or the satisfaction that users get

50:52.600 --> 51:01.480
by playing the game. So these types of games exist today but I would like to emphasize that we are

51:01.480 --> 51:09.960
still extremely early in the NFT gaming phenomenon not only played one games but generally and

51:11.960 --> 51:18.760
I said earlier that we sometimes tend to be unfair to the people that are creating these games

51:18.760 --> 51:28.520
because we compare them with huge conglomerates that have been hugely successful

51:28.520 --> 51:35.080
in monetizing Web2 types of games but these people are startups that are trying to redefine an industry

51:36.280 --> 51:42.760
and it has proven to be very challenging to create a self-sustaining in-game economy. So as I've said

51:42.760 --> 51:47.560
most of the projects are using a dual layer structure so both fudgeable tokens and NFTs

51:48.200 --> 51:54.120
and a multi-tokens structure within its layer so you might have a governance and a utility token

51:54.120 --> 52:03.160
and multiple NFTs but I have yet to see a successful token economics mechanism so if you

52:04.440 --> 52:10.840
if you witness most of the projects they follow a trajectory in which at least if their utility

52:10.840 --> 52:19.400
token doesn't have enough utility it tends to fall in value because people would sell

52:19.400 --> 52:27.080
it if they have nothing to do with it within the game and this of course creates a selling pressure

52:27.080 --> 52:34.360
that combined with the infinite supply utility tokens that most projects would follow

52:35.000 --> 52:41.160
will result a in a death spiral for the price of the token. It is interesting because

52:41.160 --> 52:49.880
some analysts go as far as claiming that the play-to-earn movement itself is not sustainable

52:49.880 --> 52:56.760
because giving monetary rewards may prove to be bad for player retention because it weakens the

52:56.760 --> 53:02.680
the internal motivation that players would have at playing the game, I'm not sure I subscribe to this

53:02.680 --> 53:09.800
line of thought I think there's a very huge incentive for people to play games for some

53:09.800 --> 53:21.400
monitary gain and if we are true believers in our conviction that Web3

53:21.400 --> 53:29.240
is about taking value from the platforms and giving it to the users then all these

53:29.240 --> 53:35.720
billions that we discussed earlier, being made today by the gaming industry and being shared by a

53:35.720 --> 53:45.000
small group of companies that control it, we will flow through to the end

53:45.000 --> 53:54.760
users if and when we start finding self-sustainable economic models for that. A more

53:55.400 --> 54:00.440
fair criticism is that most games today seem to emphasize the tokenomics that I discussed

54:00.440 --> 54:07.640
earlier more than game design but we have to understand that for game design on blockchain we have

54:07.640 --> 54:15.320
huge technical challenges which at the moment prevent us from creating 100% decentralized

54:15.320 --> 54:22.120
games, remember the metaphor I used earlier, we are in the early days of the internet so as the first

54:23.080 --> 54:29.880
popular games in the internet era where months there were games that allowed many people to play

54:29.880 --> 54:36.920
together but they were text-based or storyboarded because you couldn't have sophisticated graphics

54:36.920 --> 54:43.640
in the primitive internet infrastructure we have the same thing here, we have blockchains that are

54:43.640 --> 54:51.160
very slow, transactions are public so you cannot have a real-time game, you cannot have game in

54:51.160 --> 54:56.680
which if I do something and this something creates a transaction on the blockchain and this

54:56.680 --> 55:04.360
is published you know 12 seconds later in Ethereum then my character will wait for 12

55:04.360 --> 55:11.080
seconds before it fires a bullet out of their weapon, this is a very bad user experience

55:11.080 --> 55:16.920
so we need to solve these technical problems but I'm not worried about technical problems like it

55:17.480 --> 55:24.360
happened in the early days of the internet and many people thought back then that this would be

55:24.360 --> 55:28.120
the lack of speed or security or whatever would be something that would

55:29.480 --> 55:35.880
condemn internet to oblivion and of course, it didn't happen, I am sure that the technical

55:35.880 --> 55:43.400
challenges will be solved. In the meantime we will be looking at games that are only partially

55:43.400 --> 55:50.520
decentralized and when I say partially I mean the characters, the avatars and the assets are

55:50.520 --> 55:56.840
decentralized they exist on public blockchains and they are truly owned by the players but the

55:56.840 --> 56:05.720
gameplay mechanics are still centralized and they happen on centralized servers. So concluding

56:07.480 --> 56:15.480
this session I would like to just emphasize four points: Number one is that gaming is huge

56:15.480 --> 56:23.560
and if gaming moves to blockchain and mass this will prove to be a killer application for

56:23.560 --> 56:31.800
NFTs I know that with (Punk) 6529 you've discussed a lot about art and generative art and PFPs and

56:31.800 --> 56:38.840
all these things and these are all fine applications but I think gaming is going to prove to be one

56:38.840 --> 56:44.600
of the killer application of NFTs and of course PFP collections and even generative and stuff like

56:44.600 --> 56:53.320
that has a huge role to play in gaming. The second takeaway is, I think that blockchain

56:54.040 --> 57:01.240
will act as the value layer in games providing three things, one is true ownership of assets by users,

57:03.000 --> 57:09.000
number two interoperability of assets so the ability to move assets across games and, number

57:09.000 --> 57:17.720
three, creating sustainable in-game and across-game economics. Take away number three, there are still

57:17.720 --> 57:24.200
significant challenges to be overcome many of them are technological and design oriented, we still

57:24.200 --> 57:33.480
haven't figured out ways in which we can move game mechanics to the blockchain and some challenges

57:33.480 --> 57:40.120
are economic we still haven't managed to find the perfect balance between governance,

57:40.120 --> 57:47.400
utility and non-fungible tokens to create a self-sustaining economy within a game.

57:48.360 --> 57:55.960
Finally, keep in mind and we'll discuss this next week with (Punk) 6529 in more detail that games

57:56.920 --> 58:00.760
can be thought of as early examples of metaverses and may

58:00.760 --> 58:06.760
yet prove to be the application type through which most people will have their first

58:07.640 --> 58:15.080
work-free exposure. As always we have some further reading for you and this concludes

58:15.640 --> 58:25.240
the slides for this week. If you have questions let me move to Discord. I mean as usual, you can

58:25.240 --> 58:33.080
see in the screen you can ask your questions in the OM Chat or on Twitter using the #NFTQnA

58:33.080 --> 58:42.680
hashtag my colleagues will have probably already started feeding questions on Discord for me so

58:42.680 --> 58:50.680
let me switch and see if I can find them there and I have my colleague Chris Christou from

58:50.680 --> 58:57.240
the UNIC Virtual Reality Lab with me in case there are questions that are more technical

58:57.240 --> 59:03.960
because as I said I don't come from a gaming background I might call him to join me in

59:03.960 --> 59:15.160
answering them so let me see. So there's one question that says "is it actually sustainable

59:15.160 --> 59:22.520
to release a token for a game that can be exchanged for fiat?" well that's a

59:22.520 --> 59:33.480
million dollar question. It's certainly this is the case we have it is proven by the gaming

59:33.480 --> 59:38.680
industry that people there's lots of people out there there's a big market for gaming so there's

59:38.680 --> 59:44.760
lots of people that would actually be able to open their wallet and pay money to play a game,

59:44.760 --> 59:53.560
they pay literally billions every year to play games. Whether this could translate into a sustainable

59:53.560 --> 00:03.720
mechanism through which money flows into an in-game economy in blockchain and allows that value

00:03.720 --> 00:10.360
to be multiplied between the users of that economy and somehow shared between those that

00:10.360 --> 00:18.520
create the game, those that play the game and those that provide the foundational infrastructure for

00:18.520 --> 00:28.760
security and scalability so the underlying blockchain is something we

00:28.760 --> 00:35.560
need to see how this could happen. I have to say that out of the examples that I showed you earlier

00:35.560 --> 00:42.920
and all the others that I've seen in the NFT gaming space this hasn't happened yet and I think it

00:42.920 --> 00:54.680
has happened for two reasons. One is that there hasn't been a game yet that would attract people

00:56.520 --> 01:03.080
for the intrinsic motivation, there have not been games like Minecraft or Roblox or

01:03.080 --> 01:09.160
the World of Warcraft or all the other games that have managed to create communities of millions of

01:09.160 --> 01:15.240
people that want to play the game for the shear pleasure of playing the game and even pay to play

01:15.240 --> 01:24.840
that game. Here we have mostly seen people that come in like "Kamikazes", getting into the game to

01:24.840 --> 01:33.400
make a quick gain out of it and this mentality does not help the community of a very particular game

01:34.120 --> 01:36.440
to create a lasting

01:40.360 --> 01:45.400
with real life with games

01:45.400 --> 01:51.400
games

01:51.400 --> 01:58.120
option that is more organic and less important people that play the game because they like it and

01:58.120 --> 02:04.760
they're not ready to leave it to go to the next game because they would make more money in the short term

02:04.760 --> 02:16.200
out of it. I'm not saying it's not

02:16.200 --> 02:19.400
I see myself

02:23.720 --> 02:26.920
some sort of internet

02:26.920 --> 02:27.560
let me know

02:27.560 --> 02:34.280
okay sweet okay I will continue saying that

02:38.920 --> 02:40.680
you know they will not do it

02:42.920 --> 02:50.040
maybe it's a process some of the games that we've seen become useful for a

02:50.040 --> 02:57.560
community or a longer amount of time like Axie Infinity or Stepping might make it

02:57.560 --> 03:04.280
but go through you know so what happened they went down now they will go up and find you know an

03:04.280 --> 03:12.200
equilibrium but I think to answer your question that we will see games and we will see games very soon

03:12.200 --> 03:23.560
that people would be willing to use their tokens inside the game and sell it outside the game for fiat

03:23.560 --> 03:29.080
and there will be a thriving demand

03:32.120 --> 03:36.760
and this is becoming the speed of blockchain transactions

03:36.760 --> 03:38.760
I mean

03:38.760 --> 03:40.760
yeah

03:40.760 --> 03:42.760
question

03:46.200 --> 03:52.280
blockchain scalability is a challenging thing I mean

03:53.800 --> 04:01.160
I've been in blockchain since the very beginning. Satoshi chose a 10-minute interval between

04:01.160 --> 04:13.240
blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain because it wasn't possible to propagate transactions in the network

04:13.240 --> 04:21.880
in a less amount of time so that all miners would know of the latest block

04:21.880 --> 04:26.360
and we'll be able to start working on the next one when the previous one was mineg so

04:26.360 --> 04:32.680
the Bitcoin blockchain had and still has a 10-minute interval between

04:36.440 --> 04:38.440
between blocks

04:40.920 --> 04:42.840
now moved to

04:45.560 --> 04:54.440
my 12 intervals between blocks so in 10 years time because Bitcoin started in 2009, we're not

04:54.440 --> 05:03.800
2022 so 13 years time we have gone from 10 minutes to 12 seconds and there are all sorts of solutions for

05:05.240 --> 05:14.280
scaling that further and new technologies are coming all the time either for Layer 2s like optimistic roll-ups or

05:14.280 --> 05:26.120
zero-knowledge snarks or other ways all for Layer 1s that have much much less demands in terms of

05:26.120 --> 05:39.720
space or computing power or synchronization of nodes and so on so I'm sure that in the future

05:39.720 --> 05:47.480
this problem will be solved but for the time being because games need near-instantaneous

05:49.000 --> 05:56.520
type of reactions, when I have a shooting game and you fire the weapon it's the bullet to go

05:56.520 --> 06:02.360
watch it its target of not hit it's targeting and do whatever it will do instantaneously I cannot

06:02.360 --> 06:11.480
wait 12 seconds I cannot even wait two seconds for the experience would be detrimental so

06:12.760 --> 06:22.680
my personal six times of game the first types of games will be becoming not going to be like

06:25.240 --> 06:30.680
huge requirements in terms of speed that's why we're seeing you know card-based games in which players

06:30.680 --> 06:36.920
play in terms so there's no real-time interaction we see the move to earn type of

06:37.480 --> 06:38.840
standard you get

06:40.040 --> 06:49.480
free for or stepping or whatever because these things do not have with and and real-time interaction

06:49.480 --> 07:01.640
requirements it will probably be a few years before we start seeing the migration of 

07:01.640 --> 07:09.720
interactive games to the blockchain today. I have to wait until the holographic technology comes out and

07:09.720 --> 07:17.240
then games will be the ultimate experience, that's very interesting and I think I will answer

07:17.240 --> 07:26.600
this question then we can probably wrap this up. In the reader science world there have been two

07:26.600 --> 07:34.840
technologies that (how can I say) invited radical of researchers at

07:36.120 --> 07:41.800
indifferent points in time one was artificial intelligence that started in the late 60s with

07:41.800 --> 07:49.880
lots of unfair and expectations never managed to deliver much until the

07:53.240 --> 07:58.120
the discovery of Neural Networks and Deep Learning a few years ago and suddenly we have a

07:58.760 --> 08:04.760
solution. The other technology is virtually everything that has to do with the virtualization of the reality

08:04.760 --> 08:13.480
around us, either pure virtual reality or of managed reality has up to nowbeen more hype

08:13.480 --> 08:24.040
than reality so to address the students comment I will say yes, I agree, if and when we see a holographic

08:24.040 --> 08:37.400
technology come out or be too heavy and difficult to use and we'll not have

08:37.400 --> 08:41.960
a huge latency and I will not get dizzy after using them for 10 minutes or whatever,

08:42.520 --> 08:48.120
yes, there's huge potential for virtual long-term reality and also to be extremely

08:48.120 --> 08:55.560
uh and this happened we'll discuss all these in a couple of weeks because we have a dedicated

08:55.560 --> 09:03.000
session in transiting visualization technology, I think Chris would have a lot to say then but

09:03.880 --> 09:09.720
until the time that these technologies become really
09:09.720 --> 09:23.160
let's say, come to go to standard in which they can be commercially deployed for the mass market

09:25.480 --> 09:34.040
need some time so we'll see. Another question is "what incentive do current game designers have

09:34.600 --> 09:39.400
to explore or adopt blockchain in their games, don't they currently benefit from their centralized

09:39.400 --> 09:45.880
approach?" The answer is a clear yes but that has never stopped the world from progressing it's you know

09:46.920 --> 09:53.240
heard this argument time and again and says "what incentive does Kodak have to

09:53.240 --> 09:59.800
invest in digital photography, don't they profit from analog photography?" The answer is yes

09:59.800 --> 10:06.120
they did profit but some competitors will disrupt them and will if they do not adapt to the new

10:06.120 --> 10:13.480
technologies they will die so for the studios and the game designers and the big technology companies

10:14.600 --> 10:20.280
that decide now it should be more to have a centralized approach I'm not looking at

10:20.280 --> 10:25.880
blockchain as an alternative they might be lucky and blockchain never makes it but if it does

10:25.880 --> 10:34.280
you know in 10 years' time many of the household names that we know today will be in history like

10:34.280 --> 10:43.480
Kodak or Fuji in the analog for those businesses and they will be substituted by others.

10:44.760 --> 10:52.760
So, i think this concludes today's lecture, thank you very much for being with us, next week we'll

10:52.760 --> 11:08.680
have a (Punk)6529 discussing the Metaverse, thank you very much for being here and see you next week. Bye bye

11:22.760 --> 11:25.400
you
