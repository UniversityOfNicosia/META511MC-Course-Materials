00:00.000 --> 00:17.880
 love you.

00:30.000 --> 00:38.520
 Hello, friends. Welcome to the University of Nicosia. Welcome to the Open Metaverse.

00:38.520 --> 00:45.280
 I'm George Giaglis and it's a real honor and a pleasure to welcome you all here today.

00:45.280 --> 00:52.240
 I'm really excited to see hundreds of people from all over the world joining us. This is

00:52.240 --> 00:58.800
 a truly historic day as we all come together for the first live session of the world's

00:58.800 --> 01:05.040
 first ever university level course that will take place entirely on-chain and in the metaverse.

01:06.080 --> 01:13.680
 I couldn't be prouder to have with me as a co-instructor in the 12-week journey that we start

01:13.680 --> 01:23.680
 today, Punk 6529, who is undoubtedly the world's leading authority and a visionary thinker in the

01:23.680 --> 01:32.400
 field of NFTs, the Open Metaverse and the future of our decentralized world. I am so proud to count

01:32.400 --> 01:42.080
 him among my mentors. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the more than 50 investors,

01:42.080 --> 01:49.200
 artists, collectors, entrepreneurs and thinkers that have kindly agreed to share their unique

01:49.200 --> 01:56.800
 insights into NFTs and the metaverse with us over the next weeks. I cannot honestly think of any

01:57.600 --> 02:04.320
 university course ever that has had such an impressive lineup of invited speakers

02:04.320 --> 02:08.720
 and I'm sure that I will be learning from them as much as everyone else here today.

02:10.240 --> 02:17.040
 Special thanks also to my amazing team at UNIC who are constantly breaking new ground

02:17.040 --> 02:22.720
 and always give their very best to support our students and the educational experience that

02:22.720 --> 02:29.440
 we'll be having over the coming weeks. And last but not least, a big thanks to Ryan,

02:29.440 --> 02:35.840
 Mungi and the whole team at Oncyber for making all this possible and for working around the clock

02:35.840 --> 02:41.920
 with 6529 and the UNIC team to create an awesome metaverse experience for everyone.

02:41.920 --> 02:48.400
 Right, so before we begin with session one, let me bring up our presentation to take you quickly

02:48.400 --> 02:56.800
 through the logistics of the course. So, as you know, the course will be running for 12 weeks.

02:57.280 --> 03:03.200
 Each week there will be a presentation like the one that you are looking at now. This will include

03:03.200 --> 03:08.880
 further reading material for those of you interested in it. We will also have a live session

03:08.880 --> 03:16.560
 like the one we're having today and we will have starting next week one or more additional

03:16.560 --> 03:23.760
 guest lecturers or interviews or panels. All material, including this live session, will be recorded.

03:24.400 --> 03:30.160
 Everything will be available to watch on demand for those of you that cannot attend live either

03:30.160 --> 03:36.640
 for due to time zone constraints or some other reason. At the end of the course, there will be

03:36.640 --> 03:43.360
 an assessment. The assessment will be different for those of you that are already students at the

03:43.360 --> 03:48.880
 University of Nicosia and want to take academic credit from this course. You will have to do to

03:48.880 --> 03:57.040
 take a qualitative assessment. Everybody else who simply wants to receive an NFT in the form of a

03:57.040 --> 04:03.360
 professional certificate issued by the University of Nicosia will have to pass an online multiple

04:03.360 --> 04:13.280
 choice test with a score of 60% or more. As I've said, the course is being led by Punk 6529

04:13.280 --> 04:20.640
 and I'm going to be helping him whenever I can, but obviously such an experimental new course

04:20.640 --> 04:27.600
 couldn't have been possible without the help of many people from our team, both at the University

04:27.600 --> 04:35.280
 of Nicosia and from the team of 6529. In this slide, you can see the members of the team

04:36.320 --> 04:45.520
 that are the main contacts for this course. We have introduced them in the pre-course last week.

04:45.520 --> 04:51.520
 You can find their Twitter, Handle and Discord username for all of them, so please refer to this

04:51.520 --> 04:59.520
 slide and talk to them either in Discord or on Twitter for anything that you need relating to

04:59.520 --> 05:05.120
 this course. All of them are with you today in the home and are monitoring the chat, so they will

05:05.120 --> 05:12.480
 be taking on questions that they can as we go along. Let me say a few words about the University

05:12.480 --> 05:18.160
 of Nicosia because I'm sure judging from the multitude of countries where everybody's coming

05:18.160 --> 05:25.200
 from, many of you might not know us. We are the largest English-speaking university in Southern

05:25.200 --> 05:33.280
 Europe. We are a comprehensive university. We have more than 14,500 students across more than 100

05:33.280 --> 05:42.000
 degree undergraduate and postgraduate programs. We are ranked top 3% globally and among the top

05:42.000 --> 05:50.000
 200 to 250 universities in the European Union. We are one of only 50 universities in the world

05:50.000 --> 06:00.240
 that have received five stars in the QS assessment about our online teaching. Our campus in Nicosia

06:01.280 --> 06:08.960
 consists of more than 20 different buildings, among them probably the world's most beautiful

06:08.960 --> 06:14.480
 and iconic student accommodation server. But apart from the people that we have

06:16.080 --> 06:23.200
 on site in the university, we are very active online and we are particularly active in the field

06:23.200 --> 06:29.520
 of crypto. We have always been a global pioneer in this space. We were the first university in

06:29.520 --> 06:36.880
 the world to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments. We were the first to launch a course in crypto,

06:36.880 --> 06:42.800
 our free MOOC, the introduction to digital currencies taught by Andreas Antonopoulos,

06:42.800 --> 06:48.480
 Antonis Polimitis and myself have been continuously running since 2013. It was the first course ever

06:48.480 --> 06:55.200
 in the world and we are proud to have trained more than 80,000 students from more than 120

06:55.200 --> 07:01.680
 countries until today. We were the first to offer a full academic degree in this area. Our master's

07:01.680 --> 07:07.840
 in blockchain and digital currency started in 2014 and is still the world's largest program in

07:07.840 --> 07:14.960
 crypto. We were the first university ever to issue our certificates as blockchain verifiable

07:14.960 --> 07:24.320
 credentials. We started in 2015 with our MOOC alumni. Then in 2017 we moved to issue all the

07:24.320 --> 07:29.840
 degrees that are awarded by the University of Nicosia. They are now awarded on the issued on

07:29.840 --> 07:36.240
 the blockchain. Last year we started issuing certificates also in the form of NFTs on the

07:36.240 --> 07:42.880
 Ethereum blockchain. We have the largest dedicated crypto team in academia globally, in our

07:42.880 --> 07:51.120
 Institute for the Future. We do basic and applied research working with many crypto projects as

07:51.120 --> 07:57.360
 well as institutional partners like the European Commission or the European Central Bank. We aspire

07:57.360 --> 08:04.000
 to become the first university in the metaverse having launched this course today in partnership

08:04.000 --> 08:11.520
 with Punk 6529 and hopefully we will be aiming a new full academic degree in metaverse systems

08:12.080 --> 08:19.200
 next year. Now having said that trying to be first at something is always a challenging

08:19.200 --> 08:27.840
 endeavor so this course and the whole learning experience is going to be a big bet for us and I

08:27.840 --> 08:32.480
 think it's going to be a learning experience for everybody. We've frequently said that this is the

08:32.480 --> 08:38.880
 first university course to be held on chain and in the metaverse. Let me take a second to explain

08:38.880 --> 08:48.080
 what we mean. By on chain we mean that our internal bet is to try to do as much as possible in this

08:48.080 --> 08:54.720
 course without touching upon any centralized information system of the university. That's why

08:54.720 --> 09:01.600
 we did not ask you to register in a web page and give us your full name and contact details and email

09:01.600 --> 09:08.720
 or whatever. We asked you to mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and this NFT will become

09:08.720 --> 09:19.120
 your ticket to access the class. We aim to have all material available in the form of NFTs so

09:19.120 --> 09:25.120
 everything will be air-dropped to your wallets so those of you that have minted the course access

09:25.120 --> 09:31.680
 token I would encourage you to transfer that token to a separate wallet that you control

09:31.680 --> 09:36.880
 because on that wallet will be air-dropping a number of things including this presentation,

09:36.880 --> 09:42.160
 interviews, panels, discussions, everything that we're going to be doing in this course.

09:42.960 --> 09:48.800
 By the end of this course you will have a full portfolio of material inside your Ethereum

09:48.800 --> 09:54.720
 wallet. That's what on chain means and in the metaverse obviously means that we're going to be

09:54.720 --> 10:05.840
 using the OM to do that. Today we are using the open space of OM. We are here in this beautiful park

10:05.840 --> 10:13.840
 but starting in the coming weeks we will be gradually revealing parts of the metacampus

10:13.840 --> 10:20.240
 that we are building in the OM. We're going to be holding future activities in auditoriums,

10:20.240 --> 10:25.440
 in special learning facilities, we're going to have exhibition rooms, we're going to experiment

10:25.440 --> 10:36.320
 with many modalities within the metaverse and we would like to have you with us in this journey.

10:36.320 --> 10:41.360
 We expect to have some hiccups at the beginning of the course and probably even later as we're

10:41.360 --> 10:48.640
 constantly breaking new ground. Please get back to us, tell us what you think, what works well

10:48.640 --> 10:54.640
 for you, what doesn't work well for you. If you have any feedback or ideas or you would like to

10:54.640 --> 11:02.880
 help us in making this experience better for everyone we are open to your suggestions on Discord,

11:02.880 --> 11:09.440
 on Twitter and in the chat here. A quick technical tip for those of you that

11:11.120 --> 11:15.600
 are connected through mobile you will make most of your experience if you connect through a desktop

11:15.600 --> 11:21.920
 environment and if you connect through a laptop please make sure that you set it up so that your

11:21.920 --> 11:30.560
 browser uses your dedicated graphics card if you have one to render the world that you are seeing

11:30.560 --> 11:37.120
 in the OM. Many laptops would by default use their internal graphics card and you might have

11:37.840 --> 11:44.000
 a lesser experience. Having said that because we have hundreds of people we have made the design

11:44.000 --> 11:52.800
 choice today to create separate rooms. Each room consists of around 300 people so that we do not

11:52.800 --> 12:00.720
 have hundreds and hundreds of people in the same space to avoid any performance issues.

12:00.720 --> 12:06.640
 In the future as we become more comfortable with the performance of the world and the environment

12:07.360 --> 12:12.880
 we will be bringing more and more people in the same instance as well. I'm saying that because

12:12.880 --> 12:21.920
 as we go along and especially in the Q&A session some of you might hear either 6529 or me talking

12:21.920 --> 12:27.440
 about a question in the chat that you might have not seen in the chat and will be wondering what's

12:27.440 --> 12:34.880
 happened. The reason is that there are separate chats in each of the rooms so each group of 300

12:34.880 --> 12:41.760
 people or less are looking at a different chat and we are combining everything together in our

12:41.760 --> 12:48.240
 current. Another thing that I would like to stress is that everything that you see in this

12:48.240 --> 12:54.720
 course coming from the University of Nicosia is released under a Creative Commons Attribution

12:54.720 --> 13:01.040
 License which means that you are totally free to reuse the presentation materials and everything

13:01.040 --> 13:05.840
 else that we produce in this course as long as you attribute back to the University of Nicosia.

13:05.840 --> 13:12.400
 So you can take this slide use them as they are or modify them so long as you attribute that the

13:12.400 --> 13:20.160
 source was the University of Nicosia in this course. Obviously, this release has to do only with

13:20.160 --> 13:26.880
 intellectual property that comes from UNIC and not intellectual property from other parties.

13:26.880 --> 13:32.160
 All the presentations will be available on our GitHub and all the presentations will be minted

13:32.160 --> 13:40.080
 as NFTs and air-dropped to your wallets. Obviously, this is an educational course only.

13:40.080 --> 13:45.920
 We will be discussing various projects, various people, various NFTs. None of this is an investment

13:45.920 --> 13:52.160
 advice. None of this is a recommendation to either buy or sell an NFT. I hope that this is

13:52.160 --> 13:58.960
 clear to everyone but I had to set it. If you are new to crypto, note that we are at the frontier

13:58.960 --> 14:05.600
 of investment classes here and any investments at all at Island should be made only after careful

14:05.600 --> 14:14.720
 research and probably after consulting a professional advisor. As you have seen in the website,

14:14.720 --> 14:21.200
 we have a 12-week schedule ahead of us. We are in the first week now so we're just going to be

14:21.200 --> 14:27.200
 laying the ground, and the background and making sure that everyone is on the same page about

14:27.200 --> 14:33.120
 what is an NFT and why all these things are important? Each week we're going to be dealing

14:33.120 --> 14:41.280
 with a specific subject either on NFTs until week seven or related to the metaverse from week eight

14:41.280 --> 14:50.320
 onwards. That was it in terms of the logistics of the course and let's go to session one.

14:50.320 --> 14:57.760
 Session one is a challenging session in the sense that we have a very diverse group of

14:57.760 --> 15:03.680
 students obviously. There have been more than 20,000 people that have minted the course access NFT

15:03.680 --> 15:11.920
 and we're super happy about that but obviously, some of you are very new to this area and some

15:11.920 --> 15:18.720
 others are at the other end of the spectrum. You might already be developing or collecting NFTs

15:18.720 --> 15:27.600
 and hence you know much of the background information. The goal for today is just to create

15:27.600 --> 15:33.280
 a common language about NFTs with everyone. Some of you will find today's presentation very

15:33.280 --> 15:40.480
 straightforward or even simplistic. Others might find it very difficult. The presentation will

15:40.480 --> 15:47.360
 consist of two parts. I will start with a brief technical overview to define NFTs and discuss

15:47.360 --> 15:52.720
 some of the standards for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain and then I'm going to hand over

15:52.720 --> 15:59.840
 to 6529 who will take us through the different types of NFTs, their use cases, examples of

15:59.840 --> 16:09.360
 interesting collections and explore the market size and structure for NFTs. Let me start with

16:09.360 --> 16:17.040
 a technical discussion. I'm going to try to keep it as simple as possible and not go through

16:17.040 --> 16:22.400
 everything that you see in the slides. You can read them on your own time. First of all,

16:23.520 --> 16:31.520
 I hope it's clear to everyone that NFTs live exist on blockchains. If you are not familiar

16:31.520 --> 16:37.920
 with the concept of a blockchain, a distributed network of computers processing transactions

16:37.920 --> 16:44.800
 in a peer-to-peer manner, grouping them into blocks and appending them into a chain, then I

16:44.800 --> 16:52.720
 would suggest that you follow our introduction to digital currencies MOOC, the link to which

16:52.720 --> 17:01.040
 you can find at the bottom of this slide. NFTs live on blockchains and so we could be

17:01.760 --> 17:08.800
 spending time here discussing the different types of blockchains, but we decided to keep things

17:08.800 --> 17:15.360
 simple to just base the discussion on one of them, the Ethereum blockchain. I'd like to start

17:15.360 --> 17:21.760
 by discussing what Ethereum is. Ethereum is what we could call a second-generation blockchain that

17:21.760 --> 17:28.240
 is capable of running applications. I'm using the term second-generation to differentiate it from

17:28.240 --> 17:35.520
 Bitcoin, which everybody considers as the prime example of the first-generation blockchain. Bitcoin

17:35.520 --> 17:42.080
 is an open public and permissionless network of computers. This means that anyone can join

17:43.040 --> 17:48.880
 just by downloading some software and connecting to the network, but Bitcoin is single-use.

17:48.880 --> 17:55.760
 The only thing that the Bitcoin blockchain is doing is effectively processing the Bitcoin token,

17:55.760 --> 18:01.440
 so the blockchain and the token have the same name. Ethereum is a second-generation blockchain

18:01.440 --> 18:07.600
 network that is similar and very different to Bitcoin at the same time. It's similar because

18:07.600 --> 18:14.400
 it's also an open permissionless public blockchain and also has its own token. It's called Ether.

18:14.400 --> 18:19.040
 Many people call the token Ethereum as well, but technically Ethereum is the blockchain and

18:19.040 --> 18:27.680
 Ether is the token. However, unlike Bitcoin, this is a blockchain in which we can program and run

18:27.680 --> 18:33.680
 applications. Very simplistically, you can think of Ethereum as the Internet of decentralized

18:33.680 --> 18:40.160
 applications, a global network of computers that can run any application without needs for

18:40.160 --> 18:46.400
 intermediaries. You can have the functionality of Facebook without having Facebook, the company

18:46.400 --> 18:52.560
 mediating the transactions. You can have e-commerce without Amazon or some other provider,

18:52.560 --> 18:58.400
 and this is what is most revolutionary about these types of blockchains. How is this possible?

18:58.960 --> 19:04.160
 It's possible because Ethereum and other similar blockchains run what we call smart contracts,

19:04.160 --> 19:11.520
 and smart contracts are computer programs that run on the blockchain and are immutable. Immutable

19:11.520 --> 19:18.800
 means that they cannot change, and this is a very powerful characteristic. I cannot overstate the

19:18.800 --> 19:25.200
 importance of this characteristic. We have programs that once we hit run and we deploy them on the

19:25.200 --> 19:34.800
 Ethereum blockchain, they cannot be stopped or modified or nothing even by their owner. Technically,

19:35.760 --> 19:44.880
 the owner can keep them in a state that is changeable, but I hope you will forgive the simplicity

19:44.880 --> 19:52.800
 here. The promise of having such immutable code running on a blockchain is nothing

19:52.800 --> 19:58.800
 short of revolutionary because now, for the first time in history, we have the ability to program

19:58.800 --> 20:04.880
 any interaction between parties that is automatable, program it in a smart contract,

20:04.880 --> 20:09.840
 and be trusted to run as programmed without intermediaries and without censorship,

20:09.840 --> 20:15.440
 without anyone being able to stop it. This opens up the possibility to all sorts of applications.

20:16.640 --> 20:20.400
 The other difference of Ethereum is that it is a multi-token network. As I've said,

20:20.400 --> 20:27.360
 it has its own native currency, Ether, but on Ethereum, we can also create additional tokens.

20:27.920 --> 20:32.880
 Some of these tokens are fungible and they follow a standard that we call ERC20,

20:32.880 --> 20:42.800
 and others are non-fungible or NFTs, and they follow different standards like ERC721 or ERC1155.

20:43.760 --> 20:51.600
 Fungibility is a property that has to do with whether different units of some asset are exchangeable

20:51.600 --> 20:58.320
 or not. When we say that a token is fungible, we mean that any two units of that token have the

20:58.320 --> 21:04.240
 same value. If you have one Ether and I have one Ether, this Ether, in theory, should have the same

21:04.240 --> 21:10.560
 dollar value, but non-fungible tokens are unique. They are different from each other. If you have

21:10.560 --> 21:16.480
 a CryptoPunk and I have a CryptoPunk, the value of our Punks is generally not the same because

21:16.480 --> 21:21.360
 each token has its own properties, so some of them might be more valuable than others.

21:21.360 --> 21:29.520
 As I've said, there are three major standards in Ethereum governing token creation.

21:30.240 --> 21:35.680
 One of them is outside the scope of this course. ERC20 is the most popular

21:35.680 --> 21:44.240
 standard and it deals with fungible tokens. The other two, ERC721 and ERC1155 were both

21:44.240 --> 21:53.200
 released in 2018 and they both deal with NFTs. ERC721 is the most widely used standard for NFTs

21:53.200 --> 22:03.760
 today. ERC11155 is a more complex version that allows us to create smart contracts that manage

22:03.760 --> 22:10.720
 multiple token types at the same time. These tokens could be fungible, non-fungible or hybrid.

22:10.720 --> 22:20.400
 ERC20 is, as I've said, outside the scope of this course, so tokens like Uniswap, Sushi,

22:20.400 --> 22:28.080
 Tether, USDC, Manna, or Raptether that you see in this slide basically deal with various types

22:28.080 --> 22:33.600
 of financial applications, so we're not going to be dealing with them. If you are interested

22:33.600 --> 22:39.600
 in fungible tokens, then we've got you covered. We have another MOOC that I'm also teaching with a

22:39.600 --> 22:46.000
 group of colleagues from the University of Nicosia on decentralized finance. You can access this

22:46.000 --> 22:51.200
 at the link that you see at the bottom of this page and it's a totally free course.

22:53.840 --> 22:59.680
 What we are going to be dealing with are the standards that are used to implement

22:59.680 --> 23:07.760
 non-fungible tokens. The simplest of that is ERC721. It provides basic standard functionality

23:07.760 --> 23:14.640
 that developers need in order to manage, track, and transfer NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.320
 Technically, you would need to write computer codes in a smart contract programming language

23:20.320 --> 23:25.840
 like Solidity to do that, but in practice, most creators today would use some third-party service

23:25.840 --> 23:32.800
 that would allow them to create their collections without writing code or with very little programming

23:32.800 --> 23:44.000
 involved. ERC1155 is Ethereum's multi-token standard. If you see the first three bullets in

23:44.000 --> 23:51.520
 this slide, they provide the basic difference between the main standards. If I wanted to create

23:51.520 --> 23:57.840
 an ERC20 token, a fungible token, I would create a different smart contract for each token.

23:57.840 --> 24:04.000
 So, Tether has its own smart contract and Uniswap has a totally different smart contract for the

24:04.000 --> 24:14.160
 Unit token. ERC721 allows me to have different tokens in a single contract. So, I have punk6529

24:14.160 --> 24:20.960
 and punk6530, which are different tokens, but are managed within the same contract

24:20.960 --> 24:29.280
 with different metadata, different attributes for each of the tokens. But all the attributes

24:29.280 --> 24:38.240
 are defined at the smart contract level. So, whether my crypto punk is male or female or alien

24:38.240 --> 24:49.760
 or an ape is defined in an attribute in the smart contract. And ERC1155 takes this idea of being

24:49.760 --> 24:56.400
 able to create metadata and attributes for your tokens, not at the collection level, but at the

24:56.400 --> 25:02.800
 level of the individual token, at the token ID. And this is something that is very important when

25:02.800 --> 25:08.880
 you want to create more complex applications, for example, in gaming. We'll discuss gaming later

25:08.880 --> 25:13.600
 in this course, so I'm not going to go into details. This is a table that summarizes the

25:13.600 --> 25:20.560
 differences between the two main standards for NFTs on Ethereum. Now, and I will finish with this,

25:21.120 --> 25:31.440
 if I wanted for you to take one thing away from today's lecture, the technical part of it at least,

25:31.440 --> 25:40.720
 is this slide. Many people, even people that are quite knowledgeable in NFTs, have a very

25:40.720 --> 25:49.520
 fuzzy idea or have never thought about how, where are their NFTs really stored. And what I would like

25:49.520 --> 25:57.200
 to emphasize here is that in most cases, storing big data on the blockchain is very expensive.

25:57.840 --> 26:04.720
 So, if I created a collection of 10,000 images that each of them, you know, is a few megabytes

26:04.720 --> 26:11.200
 worth of information, it would be very, very expensive to store the images themselves and

26:11.200 --> 26:18.640
 transact with the images on the blockchain. So, instead, the token that you own, when you own an

26:18.640 --> 26:24.800
 NFT token, like the course access token that you minted here, effectively you own a pointer

26:24.800 --> 26:35.120
 to a URI, a Uniform Resource Identifier, like a web page link, that points to where the actual image

26:35.760 --> 26:40.720
 or the actual content of the NFT, because it might not be an image, it might not be a video,

26:40.720 --> 26:49.040
 it might be this live session, is actually stored. And when dealing with storage, we have two options.

26:49.040 --> 26:58.960
 We can either store our NFTs in a centralized server or we can store them in a decentralized way.

26:58.960 --> 27:10.240
 And what usually happens is that in the NFT field, if we have to choose between centralized and

27:10.240 --> 27:19.360
 decentralized types of storages, always decentralized is better. So, two examples of

27:19.360 --> 27:26.480
 different philosophies that do the same thing, distributed storage of NFTs, is IPFS and RWEV.

27:26.480 --> 27:33.680
 RWEV is the standard that we are using in this course, but IPFS is equally good and they both

27:33.680 --> 27:44.880
 provide ways in which the actual image and its metadata for your NFTs are not stored in a single

27:44.880 --> 27:51.440
 central location, but are shared by thousands of computers worldwide so that you have additional

27:51.440 --> 27:58.160
 security that nobody can mess with your NFT unless the whole network goes down.

27:58.160 --> 28:05.600
 Now, in some rare cases, we might even see NFTs that are stored natively on chain and this means

28:05.600 --> 28:12.240
 that the actual image and its metadata are stored on the blockchain. This is obviously the best case

28:12.240 --> 28:18.160
 scenario. It preserves all the first order features of the blockchain, so you have really

28:18.160 --> 28:24.240
 immutable, decentralized NFTs with no single point of failure and all the other attributes that

28:24.240 --> 28:30.240
 those of you familiar with blockchains will know about, but they tend to be very expensive,

28:30.240 --> 28:38.960
 as I've said, so you would see them only when you can somehow compress the data. For example,

28:38.960 --> 28:44.480
 in generative art, as we will be discussing in a couple of weeks from now, this is a decent

28:44.480 --> 28:50.880
 choice to store your NFTs natively on chain. If you have one of one art or photography or

28:50.880 --> 28:58.880
 videography or anything else that creates large files, this is probably not feasible.

28:58.880 --> 29:07.600
 So what I want you to remember again is that when you own an NFT, effectively you own a token

29:07.600 --> 29:16.240
 that is a pointer to some location in which the actual file is saved and whether this is on chain,

29:16.240 --> 29:24.560
 off-chain decentralized or off-chain centralized matters a lot, this is going to be a big theme

29:25.440 --> 29:32.240
 in this course. Okay, so this concludes the technical primer and I'm going to be

29:33.920 --> 29:41.680
 handing over to the man that you've been waiting for. Punk 6529 is with us and I'm going to give

29:41.680 --> 29:53.120
 the floor to him to discuss what our NFTs are. So 6529, if you can hear us.

29:53.120 --> 30:21.120
 Okay, fantastic. Well, first of all, I want to do my own round of thank yous to

30:21.120 --> 30:30.640
 everyone who has brought us to this point. First of all, George and his team, the team on cyber,

30:30.640 --> 30:37.600
 the team at 6529, the broader team at the University of Nicosia that has helped even

30:37.600 --> 30:45.440
 folks who are not in the blockchain area have been helping. The audiovisual team is helping us

30:45.440 --> 30:54.000
 here today and of course all the incredible guests, lecturers, panelists that are going to be joining

30:54.000 --> 31:04.880
 during these next 12 weeks. So thank you. This is a group effort. It's a team effort and the

31:04.880 --> 31:11.360
 overall experience is going to be not just a group and team effort among the people who are working

31:11.360 --> 31:21.040
 on this course but also with the students. One of the things we are trying to understand here,

31:21.920 --> 31:29.440
 one of my deep interests in trying to understand, is in fact what we can do on chain and in the

31:29.440 --> 31:38.960
 metaphors. My general perspective is that we have been a little bit intellectually lazy in the

31:38.960 --> 31:46.560
 crypto world about how much we can actually use decentralized systems. The vast majority of people

31:47.440 --> 31:58.720
 use cryptocurrency for realistically financial speculation and sometimes things like transactions.

32:00.080 --> 32:06.480
 Part of what got me very excited about NFTs in addition to seeing great art and wonderful

32:06.480 --> 32:13.920
 artists was that the NFT world in great contrast to the fungible token world was spending a lot

32:13.920 --> 32:23.360
 of time on chain and was doing new functions on chain. Last week we were minting QQLs at

32:23.360 --> 32:29.760
 6.5 to 9. That was fun and it was an activity that I don't remember doing three or four years ago

32:29.760 --> 32:37.040
 in cryptocurrency and I believe for cryptocurrency to make it, for decentralized walkchains to make

32:37.040 --> 32:45.840
 it, we have to have real-life usage cases that are something more than we're going to hold on to

32:45.840 --> 32:55.680
 these tokens and the number is going to go up. I've mentioned this before on Twitter, I learned

32:55.680 --> 33:01.840
 by doing things and yes I'm going to be sharing some material and I think the students will learn

33:01.840 --> 33:07.440
 some things from the material that I will share but I also hope to learn from this course and

33:07.440 --> 33:15.200
 specifically what I want to learn is what does it mean to have a large group of people engage in

33:15.200 --> 33:22.720
 you know broadly a course and do it without using a centralized database. What does it mean if we're

33:22.720 --> 33:31.280
 doing a class in the metaverse but more importantly what does it mean if we're going to run a community

33:31.280 --> 33:38.480
 focused on learning about NFTs or working in the NFT space or thinking of new ideas in the NFC space

33:38.480 --> 33:41.760
 and what does that mean in a persistent three-dimensional environment.

33:43.520 --> 33:50.800
 While I think today's experience is super interesting and I've been enjoying watching it and watching

33:50.800 --> 33:58.560
 George and lurking in the background in one of the rooms I think the more interesting thing over

33:58.560 --> 34:05.200
 the course of the next few months is what we are all as a group going to do outside the classroom.

34:06.960 --> 34:12.320
 I think there will be an exercise an iterative exercise of seeing what people want to do

34:12.320 --> 34:21.280
 trying to build these spaces that enable them to do it. George mentioned the campus is being

34:22.400 --> 34:28.320
 built and the OM teams doing a lot of support there and one of the reasons the campus is not ready

34:28.320 --> 34:35.920
 is just because it's not ready but the other reason that it's not ready is we want to take a design

34:35.920 --> 34:42.480
 iterative design approach there and launch a certain set of spaces see how we use them see what other

34:42.480 --> 34:49.840
 needs we have see what spaces are needed to support those needs and what would be a great success

34:51.600 --> 34:58.240
 for me at the end of the year is not only that we've had some nice panels and lectures

34:58.240 --> 35:05.280
 but there are groups of people who have met in this course have become a part of this community

35:05.920 --> 35:12.240
 and are planning all types of interesting things to do together that we can find people to

35:13.840 --> 35:21.600
 also educate in parallel with this course. We stopped at 50-ish

35:21.600 --> 35:27.840
 lectures because the logistics were starting to get out of hand but there's a lot more people who

35:27.840 --> 35:32.240
 want to contribute and part of what we're trying to figure out once we get past these first couple

35:32.240 --> 35:42.320
 of weeks is how to let them contribute in parallel with the course. I noticed this when I was working

35:42.320 --> 35:50.160
 on my set of slides. These slides if you're deep into the crypto space today's are the NFT space

35:50.160 --> 35:54.320
 and you have a crypto background today's session is super easy but I was trying to think if we're

35:54.320 --> 36:01.680
 trying to onboard someone new here someone who is excited about the NFT world or the metaverse world

36:01.680 --> 36:09.200
 but does not have a deep understanding of crypto well we are trying to cover everything from bitcoin

36:09.200 --> 36:18.000
 to Ethereum to smart contracts to where do you store an NFT to what is the market cap of the

36:18.000 --> 36:24.240
 space what are the subsections of space in a few slides it's not possible and so what I'd like to

36:24.240 --> 36:31.280
 get to is parallel tracks people doing not every single person has to come to every session but

36:31.280 --> 36:40.080
 that over the next few weeks we have a campus an educational area where people are learning all the

36:40.080 --> 36:49.040
 time there's no bigger barrier to our development and education there's never a limit on how much

36:49.040 --> 36:53.840
 we can learn I've been in the space for a very long time and I learn new things literally every day

36:54.720 --> 36:58.640
 and there's people at different levels of development and they're going to learn things

36:58.640 --> 37:04.560
 every day as well and so we're trying to enable something like a

37:04.560 --> 37:13.040
 university of old right where you went there and you're learning you're living there and you are

37:13.600 --> 37:20.960
 aiming to learn from your colleagues and those students and the faculty and the visitors but

37:20.960 --> 37:27.200
 with the great benefit that we can do it globally for the whole world at the same time and so

37:27.200 --> 37:36.720
 this is the spirit of this course and this means that we're going to need your feedback for sure

37:37.280 --> 37:42.720
 your help for sure and your initiatives for sure to figure out how to do all these things and figure

37:42.720 --> 37:51.360
 out what are the things you want to do and so where you know reach out on Twitter on discord

37:51.360 --> 37:57.040
 feel free to organize things I think in two to three weeks once we have the basics working

37:57.600 --> 38:02.240
 we're going to be very open to people coming and saying hey I want to do a

38:04.800 --> 38:14.400
 special lecture specifically on the details of how IPFS works and we will say yes the answer is

38:14.400 --> 38:20.000
 going to be yes the answer is let's do more let's find a way for everyone to be able to share the

38:20.000 --> 38:25.440
 knowledge that they have and for people to learn that knowledge so this is my view of let's say the

38:25.440 --> 38:37.040
 course philosophy now in this and the time that I have today I'd like to do one and a half things

38:38.720 --> 38:47.200
 what I really want to focus on is my big picture conceptual idea of what NFTs are

38:47.200 --> 38:54.720
 conceptual the rest of my slides are things like well what are the sectors of the NFT space PFPs

38:54.720 --> 39:00.880
 or generative art one of ones we're going to fly through this fly through those today because for

39:00.880 --> 39:06.720
 each of those areas we have a session later in the course so I'm not going to spend almost

39:06.720 --> 39:12.800
 any time on PFPs today because we have a whole session in two weeks on PFPs and we'll dig into

39:12.800 --> 39:21.600
 the micro details there so I'm going to focus on the first set of my slides and see if we can get

39:21.600 --> 39:27.840
 some big picture ideas communicated with that's a great lead into this slide

39:29.680 --> 39:36.480
 in a way the way I see NFTs it is the most absurdly trivially simple idea

39:36.480 --> 39:46.640
 literally the only thing an NFT actually is is a token with a number they are enumerated tokens

39:47.680 --> 39:55.040
 they are tokens where you can identify one token and it is different than another token

39:55.040 --> 40:08.720
 um this sounds I mean if you think about it at this most basic level and if you

40:11.520 --> 40:19.840
 think about if this is important it sounds very unimportant I'm trying to imagine if this was

40:19.840 --> 40:30.080
 several years ago and someone told me oh this is a really important idea you know what's the idea

40:30.080 --> 40:35.680
 we're going to have tokens and we're going to put numbers on them I'm pretty sure okay well

40:35.680 --> 40:42.080
 that doesn't sound very important why is that important okay cool I guess right what we're

40:42.080 --> 40:49.840
 seeing here on the slide are the three six sequential tokens that on the crypto punks contract that

40:49.840 --> 41:01.520
 includes 6529 so in my theorem wallet is punk 65 crypto punk tokens 6529 and there's also 6528

41:01.520 --> 41:10.480
 and there's a 6530 that's all NFTs are and it's weird because it's one of those that is deceptively

41:10.480 --> 41:19.040
 simple because it actually enables a huge number of things let's go to the next slide

41:22.640 --> 41:31.760
 because the other part of NFTs you will not find on a blockchain the other important part of NFTs

41:31.760 --> 41:40.480
 is a social convention people who don't understand NFTs well often make criticisms of

41:42.000 --> 41:50.400
 the following genre but NFTs are just a receipt they're just a pointer they're not the thing

41:50.400 --> 41:55.920
 they're the thing that points to the thing George earlier pointed out that most NFTs the

41:55.920 --> 42:01.360
 actual image is not on the blockchain it's somewhere else it's on IPFS for example

42:03.200 --> 42:09.920
 and people say it as if this is some type of big gachu and that's because people haven't spent

42:09.920 --> 42:15.520
 any time thinking how any advanced society works and every single advanced society

42:16.960 --> 42:22.400
 works primarily by manipulating pointers not underlying objects

42:22.400 --> 42:30.160
 I have a big tweet storm about real estate and people say oh you know real estate is a super

42:30.160 --> 42:36.960
 tangible thing like when you very different than NFTs you own a house you own a piece of land you

42:36.960 --> 42:46.640
 own an office building but when you own a piece of land what does it actually mean what it actually

42:46.640 --> 42:52.080
 means is that the land registry office for your jurisdiction there is a title deed and that title

42:52.080 --> 43:01.200
 deed says plot 123456 is owned by Mike Smith and if Mike Smith wants to sell it to George

43:03.120 --> 43:09.760
 they're going to go to the title office and maybe some other places and maybe their lawyers will

43:09.760 --> 43:16.880
 put some documents together and they'll sign all these documents and the pointers will change hands

43:16.880 --> 43:23.040
 nothing is actually going to happen on the land itself right the land is just going to be sitting

43:23.040 --> 43:27.280
 there the land doesn't have the slightest idea the land's been there for billions of years right

43:27.280 --> 43:33.680
 that's the slightest idea that there are some overgrown monkeys us who are trading pieces of paper

43:33.680 --> 43:40.640
 or in modern times entries in a database and saying this land is my land this land is your land

43:40.640 --> 43:47.760
 we've now changed who's landed as the land's just there very much off-chain hanging out but Mike

43:47.760 --> 43:59.200
 Smith and George are trading a pointer to the land and when that pointer moves we all collectively

43:59.200 --> 44:07.600
 pretend that George owns the land just like we all collectively pretended that previously that Mike

44:07.600 --> 44:14.480
 owned the land this is the part where someone says yeah but the reason that works is society is

44:14.480 --> 44:20.720
 willing to enforce it like if George now owns the land and Mike won't get out George can call the

44:20.720 --> 44:28.720
 police and yeah that's just because society is respecting that social convention it's just a

44:28.720 --> 44:35.920
 social convention it didn't exist at some point at some point hundreds or thousands of years ago

44:35.920 --> 44:40.880
 it's one of these stories that other if it's actually true that people say about when the Europeans

44:40.880 --> 44:44.320
 came to North American the Native Americans were there they didn't really have this concept of land

44:44.320 --> 44:48.560
 ownership and they thought the Europeans were kind of nuts quite saying like oh I owned this river

44:48.560 --> 44:52.000
 and I owned this mountain I don't know if it's actually true or if it's one of those things

44:52.000 --> 44:59.360
 you learn in elementary school but in any case that is in fact how it is it's just an imaginary

44:59.360 --> 45:05.600
 social convention we have decided that the way to organize land ownership is by trading these

45:05.600 --> 45:13.680
 pieces of paper well that is exactly what NFTs are we have decided and today the people who care

45:13.680 --> 45:18.640
 about the social convention are maybe a million people or half a million people or two million

45:18.640 --> 45:26.400
 people but that number was going to grow every single year we have decided that a token and if

45:26.400 --> 45:32.320
 that token is in your wallet it is a pointer to something else and we're going to attribute

45:32.320 --> 45:42.160
 ownership to something else to the person who has that token it is also why the right click

45:42.160 --> 45:51.680
 save as argument is so very silly if you're deeply crypto native someone of course can go

45:51.680 --> 45:58.640
 right click save hug 6529 right now in fact when I first started tweeting a lot people would do it

45:58.640 --> 46:05.200
 to me all the time they'd come and say oh ha ha ha I've right click saved your punk and now I'm

46:05.200 --> 46:15.120
 going to use it okay have fun I mean you can use it but the reality is we all know that the

46:15.120 --> 46:24.560
 crypto punk token 6529 is in my wallet not in your wallet and if you want a market assessment of

46:24.560 --> 46:31.440
 how strong the social convention is the market assessment will pay exactly zero dollars for

46:31.440 --> 46:36.640
 your downloaded jpeg but would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for the token that's the

46:36.640 --> 46:43.040
 social convention at work that's why if you go just stand on someone's land you don't become an odor

46:43.040 --> 46:47.600
 of it you have to go buy the title deed right you have to go through the social convention

46:47.600 --> 46:56.720
 and let's go to the next slide please and so what does how do I see this where does this fit in

46:58.400 --> 47:07.040
 to the history of crypto assets it is all exactly the same idea as when we started with

47:08.320 --> 47:16.400
 bitcoin bitcoin is this concept for money currency you can argue which one of those two it is

47:16.400 --> 47:25.840
 is some type of commodity one of those things and what we have said in the bitcoin world is if you

47:26.480 --> 47:35.680
 own these certain outputs in your wallet you can that means something and the amount of

47:37.200 --> 47:43.360
 eye rolling that was happening a decade ago when bitcoin people would say that was gigantic

47:43.360 --> 47:48.800
 there's no question this mean anything at all why does this matter right now it has been established

47:48.800 --> 47:54.000
 that it matters and this doesn't nothing changes of bitcoin's worth two thousand dollars twenty

47:54.000 --> 48:00.080
 thousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars the it's clearly worth something people have clearly

48:00.080 --> 48:10.960
 subscribed value and monetary like value to bitcoin then the erc twenty tokens that george mentioned

48:10.960 --> 48:21.440
 earlier are more or less the same point but for financial instruments now you say well what do

48:21.440 --> 48:27.200
 you mean are they financial instruments are they securities are they not securities there's a lot

48:27.200 --> 48:33.280
 of dancing around on this topic because of the us regulations against secure against unregistered

48:33.280 --> 48:40.480
 securities so some erc twenty tokens look very much like financial instruments some go through

48:41.440 --> 48:48.800
 a variety of convoluted ideas to not look like financial instruments but basically that's what

48:48.800 --> 48:54.080
 they are right and some of them might be a security under the us definition some of them are not a

48:54.080 --> 49:00.560
 security under the us definition but what they are aiming to replicate is arbitrary financial

49:00.560 --> 49:07.440
 instruments so if bitcoin or maybe ether but you know the popular perception of bitcoin is

49:08.480 --> 49:16.320
 the underlying currency well an ERC20 token is something like a stock a bond a derivative

49:16.320 --> 49:25.360
 some weird new financial instruments that don't have great analogs in the fiat world but things

49:25.360 --> 49:33.120
 whose nature is primarily financial and they are fungible and that's how financial instruments

49:33.120 --> 49:40.400
 work right that's how financial instruments work in the real world they are all fungible

49:40.400 --> 49:46.880
 and they're traded around primarily for financial reasons and if you see how erc twenty tokens

49:46.880 --> 49:58.000
 work that's the context of their environment with this in mind we go to erc 721 switches

49:58.000 --> 50:06.000
 or 1155s in any case the NFT protocols this is the same concept for quite literally in my view

50:06.000 --> 50:12.240
 everything else in the world and it's interesting because everything else in the world is actually

50:12.240 --> 50:22.320
 a lot of things in a very big number most things in the world are non fungible there's a huge amount

50:22.320 --> 50:29.120
 of value embedded in fungible instruments in the world a huge and possibly well certainly hundreds

50:29.120 --> 50:34.080
 of trillions of dollars but there are even more hundreds of trillions of dollars embedded in

50:34.080 --> 50:38.160
 non fungible objects and with that let's go to the next slide

50:42.560 --> 50:57.360
 this is my highest level view of what nfts are what nfts can be and how nfts can develop

50:57.360 --> 51:05.760
 over the next decade and the first thing to see here is that split on the top between

51:06.800 --> 51:14.640
 natively digital intangible assets and physical or tangible assets where we're

51:14.640 --> 51:26.720
 making an abstract pointer to them nfts will first develop in the intangible natively digital

51:26.720 --> 51:38.400
 category the reason that is is because the blockchain world the online world the interoperable

51:38.400 --> 51:46.960
 with blockchain world does not need anything from the regulatory system from the government

51:46.960 --> 51:54.800
 from the enforcement mechanisms of the state in order to make the first part work so if

51:54.800 --> 52:12.560
 like uh i do on occasion we meant a meme card and there's i don't know 420 tokens and we assert

52:12.560 --> 52:25.440
 that that meme card each one of those tokens represents an addition of one out of 420 of

52:25.440 --> 52:37.120
 this piece of art and we the artists the issuer are going to treat them as such well that's it

52:37.120 --> 52:44.400
 but i don't need any other i don't need any other assistance from the state to do that

52:46.640 --> 52:51.520
 i can see where those tokens are i can interact with those tokens

52:53.280 --> 53:00.560
 permissionlessly i can say if you have one of these tokens you can come into this token gated

53:00.560 --> 53:08.640
 space in um if a person who does not currently have one of these tokens asks me how can i buy one

53:08.640 --> 53:14.480
 of the additions from this artist in the meme cards i can just point him to the meme cards

53:14.480 --> 53:19.760
 contract and say well buy one of these tokens and then they can buy it on a permissionless exchange

53:22.640 --> 53:27.520
 i never need to call the courts i never need to call the police i never need to use the

53:27.520 --> 53:34.640
 enforcement mechanism of the state that is required for physical goods because the wonderful thing with

53:35.360 --> 53:43.760
 cryptocurrency it is much easier to play defense than it is in the real world in the real world

53:44.400 --> 53:52.160
 if i was if there was no state and i had a piece of land and i'm just a normal type of guy

53:52.160 --> 54:01.440
 maybe someone who has more muscles or more guns or more friends says well i don't care about your

54:01.440 --> 54:10.880
 silly little title you have i'm moving in and you're moving out and in absence of a state

54:10.880 --> 54:16.240
 mechanism it's actually quite hard to prevent them you know if you did this with a normal

54:16.240 --> 54:21.040
 developed state you're going to call the police and the courts and someone will help get you your

54:21.040 --> 54:28.960
 property back but in absence of that you'll probably lose it with the encryption embedded in

54:28.960 --> 54:34.800
 crypto assets with the model embedded in crypto assets playing defense does not require any help

54:35.440 --> 54:41.520
 you can just have the token in your wallet and nobody can take it to you by force at a first

54:41.520 --> 54:47.760
 approximation and yeah there's hacking and things like that but at a first approximation nobody

54:47.760 --> 54:58.800
 can take it by force so what this means is anything that can be digitally linked to an NFT

55:00.400 --> 55:07.040
 can start developing now the regulatory state the normal

55:08.480 --> 55:14.640
 society is slow on innovation they'll eventually get there but it might take five years 10 years

55:14.640 --> 55:22.000
 15 years fortunately we don't need to wait for Washington or Brussels to make a decision in

55:22.000 --> 55:29.680
 order to put an intangible asset like a police of art on an NFT so in this bucket what do i say

55:29.680 --> 55:38.880
 well NFT started with what weren't something like collectibles or things that straddled the

55:38.880 --> 55:46.320
 line between collectibles and art they have gone very strongly into the art space as well

55:46.960 --> 55:53.600
 so collectibles and art are the majority of the market today what most people expect is going

55:53.600 --> 56:02.320
 to come in the next phase as greater usage in gaming assets in metaverse assets buildings

56:02.320 --> 56:12.080
 lands trees things of that nature what will come after that is more real world intellectual property

56:12.640 --> 56:20.080
 right well intellectual property that might not be directly linked to a visual on an NFT

56:20.080 --> 56:29.200
 brand's cultural society all of this type of intangible assets can come on board now there's

56:29.200 --> 56:36.800
 no technical challenge stopping it there's no regulatory framework that is needed all you need

56:36.800 --> 56:43.680
 is education onboarding and you might say well okay i mean that stuff sounds small it is not

56:43.680 --> 56:53.440
 small at all intangible assets there is a very large report and in fact George we should add it

56:53.440 --> 57:02.320
 to the reading and maybe next week that every year counts the amount of intangible assets on

57:02.320 --> 57:10.640
 corporate balance sheets and it's over 75 trillion dollars and that doesn't even capture intangible

57:10.640 --> 57:18.880
 assets that are not on balance sheet you know the American flag the statue of liberty the land of

57:18.880 --> 57:24.000
 the free and the home of the brain that's an intangible asset but you're not going to find it

57:24.800 --> 57:28.960
 written down on a financial statement somewhere but it certainly makes the united states more

57:28.960 --> 57:36.160
 valuable than if it didn't have this type of branding so we are looking already at a

57:38.000 --> 57:44.320
 existing stock of intangibles that's larger than the money supply and there's no obvious

57:44.320 --> 57:52.160
 barrier to me for some of that migrating on chain this is kind of bucket one bucket two which is my

57:54.000 --> 57:58.640
 mission for being at six five two nine's mission for being we'll cover this in later

57:58.640 --> 58:05.520
 sessions in more detail i believe NFTs can be the underlying database for an open metaverse

58:05.520 --> 58:09.520
 but i don't want to get into that today that's a longer story we'll pick that up towards the

58:09.520 --> 58:18.880
 end of the course then at some point we will start migrating non-fungible physical world assets

58:19.440 --> 58:24.640
 and services to NFTs and these are all the examples that people talk about now but nobody

58:24.640 --> 58:32.880
 does because it's going to take time oh i can buy a house by buying an NFT i can rent a holiday villa

58:32.880 --> 58:39.920
 by buying an NFT for these certain dates i can rent a digital billboard in times square for these

58:39.920 --> 58:48.800
 hours by buying an NFT and what it means once this happens you can move all of these interactions

58:48.800 --> 58:53.200
 out of a bunch of fragmented proprietary databases which is where they are now

58:53.200 --> 58:59.920
 if you want to book a night at the midtown Hilton on six avenue you have to call Hilton

58:59.920 --> 59:05.920
 which nights are available are in the Hilton database and these things are going to end up

59:05.920 --> 59:11.680
 a decade from now in the open sea of that which might be open here might be someone else so

59:11.680 --> 59:19.120
 i want to go to the Hilton let me see what the floor is for Hilton upper room prices on these

59:19.120 --> 59:29.680
 days on sixth avenue for these things to happen you'll need some more let's call it enforcement

59:29.680 --> 59:37.760
 counterparty regulatory certainty now you have the token you show up and say hey this house is mine

59:38.400 --> 59:46.080
 someone says no it's not well we're back to the physical world issues the mechanism by

59:46.080 --> 59:50.640
 which you bought the house has to be recognized by the state so you can say look Mike you've

59:50.640 --> 59:55.680
 got to leave the house i have the token i can prove to a court that i have the token and

59:55.680 --> 1:00:02.560
 you're going to get evicted so i see these coming closer to the end of the decade

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:10.320
 both will happen and when both happen you're discussing an addressable market of several

1:00:10.320 --> 1:00:19.360
 hundred trillion dollars but the natively visual ones will happen first let's go to the next slide

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:28.720
 i think this one straightforward i put it here in case anyone

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:35.520
 you know if it was helpful after the prior slides but this is in fact the kind of two

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:43.520
 by two matrix that fits here there are things that are tangible and intangible right so commodities

1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:51.760
 oil wheat etc is tangible and fungible a bushel of wheat is a bushel of wheat at a first approximation

1:00:52.880 --> 1:01:00.800
 there are things that are tangible and non fungible my house is different than your house my

1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:08.160
 painting on my wall is different than your painting on your wall there might be things

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:15.760
 that are semi fungible right my nakey sneakers are different than a lot of nakey sneakers but

1:01:15.760 --> 1:01:23.680
 similar to some nakey sneakers and well it's a joke but it's not a joke i mean us right all of us

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:31.200
 are tangible non fungible objects towards is different than me and we're very much tangible

1:01:31.200 --> 1:01:39.120
 and then on the intangible side the intangible fungibles are the ones who said before money

1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:47.040
 and financial instruments these are these are where we see the l1 the tokens of the major

1:01:47.040 --> 1:01:53.680
 blockchains and the ERC 20 tokens or their equivalent that right above them and then

1:01:53.680 --> 1:02:01.760
 tangibles and non fungible intangible non fungibles are culture society a lot of services are

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:06.240
 intangible digital goods obviously like the ones we've been describing a lot of intellectual

1:02:06.240 --> 1:02:12.560
 property and so fungible tokens will work on the first row here non fungible tokens will work on

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:24.400
 the second row short of public blockchains public cryptocurrencies getting banned by the regulators

1:02:24.400 --> 1:02:28.960
 which spending a lot of time and effort to make sure that does not happen all of this is going

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:33.680
 to happen over the course of decade and all of it is going to be actively good for society

1:02:34.880 --> 1:02:40.640
 there's no reason they'll be actively good for society in the same way that the internet was

1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:45.520
 better than filing cabinets or a bunch of independent content management systems were

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:52.480
 the internet gave you a unified platform a single standards-based interoperable way to

1:02:52.480 --> 1:03:01.200
 transmit information crypto assets give us a uniform interoperable public commons

1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:10.080
 to trade things of value whether they're fungible or non fungible so let me see which is the next

1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:20.720
 slide is one more high-level model and people who follow me on twitter hear me talking all the time

1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:29.360
 about memes and how we need to seize the memes or how the memes are the most important thing in the

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:34.320
 world and i think some people think i'm joking but i'm actually not joking at all

1:03:34.320 --> 1:03:48.160
 there's a great book called sapiens by Yovall Hariri which talks about myth how society works with

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:54.880
 myths or stories if you prefer or if you prefer if you're a sociologist inter subjective

1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.760
 realities and objective things are things like the computer i'm speaking to and the microphone

1:04:01.760 --> 1:04:09.040
 i'm speaking to objectively they're here subjective things are kind of non tangible

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:14.400
 things that i feel right i feel happy right now i'm telling you that i feel happy but i you know

1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:20.880
 there's really no way for you to see it or feel it inter subjective things are imaginary things

1:04:20.880 --> 1:04:34.560
 we believe together so imaginary things we believe together are that the Nike is a good brand

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:42.240
 but just do it makes us feel happy but just do it makes you want to buy a pair of shoes for more

1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:48.560
 money than you would have otherwise but wearing shoes with a swoosh on them might make you more

1:04:48.560 --> 1:04:56.400
 likely to jump higher or further or faster so these inter subjective myths

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:07.600
 are basically not different from the memes they're basically not and you can say okay well

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:15.440
 that's fine but that's not the important stuff the important stuff is trucks and guns and oil and

1:05:15.440 --> 1:05:24.960
 and physical resources and cash flows and investment bankers and i disagree

1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:34.560
 all of those things are downstream from memes and myths

1:05:36.240 --> 1:05:42.560
 Nike has a lot of revenue and a lot of factories and a lot of distribution

1:05:42.560 --> 1:05:48.160
 but the reason it has all these things is because people believe in the solution just do it and the

1:05:48.160 --> 1:05:55.600
 general brand that has been built and if that brand didn't exist those would be less important and

1:05:55.600 --> 1:06:04.160
 less successful it's easy to see at a national level at a national level people are willing to

1:06:04.800 --> 1:06:11.520
 unfortunately die for national memes and myths and that might be good it might be bad it might be

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:16.080
 bad it might be noble it might not be but it's clearly the case that people are going to know

1:06:17.600 --> 1:06:26.560
 if you're very good medically if you're Obama and you say yes we can and you repeat it thousands of

1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:33.600
 times or if you're Donald trump and you say make America great again and you repeat it thousands

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:43.680
 of times and your meme your myth that yes we can all do it together with solidarity or

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:50.640
 that America's on the decline but if we change how we operate it will be ascendant again these

1:06:50.640 --> 1:06:58.080
 are intersubjective myths their memes right that red hat make America red hats a meme

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:07.360
 meme if you're very good at memes the population of the united states will reward you by making

1:07:07.360 --> 1:07:14.160
 you the most powerful person in the world who can direct trillions of dollars of economic resources

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:19.920
 and give you the power to end human life on earth

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:31.680
 and yes armies are an important tangible thing they're not a meme but who gives instructions

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:40.080
 to the army is the person who's good at memes that's how you get elected and i think in the last

1:07:42.240 --> 1:07:48.720
 16 years of us politics if anyone previously had delusions that the reason you get elected is

1:07:48.720 --> 1:07:53.360
 because you write very good policy papers um that should be over now right though

1:07:54.720 --> 1:08:02.160
 well you get elected is by getting people to feel a certain way to organize a certain way to believe

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:09.760
 in a common reality a common intersubjective reality a myth a meme and then human behavior

1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:21.680
 organizes downstream from that long-winded way of saying nfts can be very important socially as well

1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:29.440
 because they give us direct access to the underlying meme

1:08:31.840 --> 1:08:35.040
 i don't think this has even played out one percent what am i about to say

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:40.560
 like if you are Nike and you are now the holder of a powerful myth

1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:50.880
 you have to go through an extremely complicated set of activities designing shoes hiring athletes

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:57.280
 who are putting them on tv running factories in Vietnam shipping shoes across the ocean

1:08:57.280 --> 1:09:02.880
 shipping shoes across the country having retail employees sell them to you accountants lawyers

1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:09.200
 taxes money and bank accounts financial statements shareholder resolutions and you pay a dividend

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:15.440
 at the end you monetize that with a vastly complicated set of activities you take the

1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:20.320
 meme that is intangible you make it tangible through a huge amount of human effort and billions of

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:31.120
 dollars of dividends got there here we can short circuit here we can hold the intellectual property

1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:35.120
 directly the meme directly i say well why does it matter what can you do with it i think we're

1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:40.640
 figuring that out i don't think it's actually this is not something where i can say on the next

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:45.200
 five slides i'm going to tell you what you can do when you see the meme no we're figuring that part

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:54.480
 out along the way and i believe this gives us the opportunity to change society for the better

1:09:55.520 --> 1:10:00.400
 that when people say well i'm not happy with this societal system or i'm not happy with that

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:05.920
 societal system well societies are just made out of people right voters are just the people

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:14.560
 you go to work with or go for drinks with or hang out with or i don't know go to sports games with

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:21.040
 those are those are the fellow voters everyone believes in memes everyone believes in myths

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:27.760
 and when you change a medium you know the medium is the message every time there's a shift in medium

1:10:27.760 --> 1:10:34.560
 there's an opportunity for new messages to emerge and perhaps we have an opportunity for

1:10:34.560 --> 1:10:43.120
 more pro-social messages to emerge for messages that are more decentralized in nature that a society

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:53.680
 that gives more trust to people and spreads power more diffuser i think there is that level

1:10:53.680 --> 1:11:02.880
 of opportunity it's not easy the opposite could also happen right NFTs are politically neutral

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:11.040
 someone could use them to very effectively promote memes that are against perhaps the values

1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:15.520
 the crypto community believes in so they're politically neutral like every other technology

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:26.160
 but i think we will see a different way of organizing human activity just like tv organized

1:11:26.160 --> 1:11:32.640
 human activity in a different way right tv was a centralized force in american culture all of a

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:40.080
 sudden once broad network tv crossed across the country at the same time at the same hour across

1:11:40.080 --> 1:11:46.320
 the gigantic country all people could watch the same show or listen to the same news anchor and

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:54.640
 that formed a form of certain social construction now we have the ability to form social construction

1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:00.640
 in the natively digital environment that we live in and without the centralization that

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:06.320
 has happened with social media companies but it's not a sure thing this part's not a sure thing

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:12.080
 this part we have to work for this part we have to figure out how to do it but i have a

1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:22.320
 very very gut sense that it is possible um i think this is it on my high concept slides and

1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:26.400
 hopefully this was comprehensible can we see the next slide please

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:34.160
 yeah i'm going to run through the rest of these slides quickly because i think for some of you

1:12:34.160 --> 1:12:38.400
 these are over basic and in any case we're going to cover this in much more detail in future sessions

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:44.960
 early nft collections did have a collectible slash gaming flavor and you know now there's a big

1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.680
 debate you know our punk's art or the collectibles or pepe's art and the collectibles they certainly

1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:53.680
 have some collectible type characteristics right even if they're art they certainly have

1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:58.720
 collectible type characteristics and this is where the space started next slide please

1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:06.960
 PFPs are by far the largest market category today we'll talk about that in a couple weeks next slide

1:13:09.200 --> 1:13:15.760
 of the more art oriented NFTs generative art has found its natural medium on chain

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:21.040
 we'll have a whole session on generative art it's probably my favorite area of

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:26.480
 NFTs and i'm very much looking forward to that we have some of the greatest

1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:32.960
 generative artists in the world joining us to talk about generative art next slide

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:40.480
 one of one art is really interesting it's such a token-based term right it's because the

1:13:41.600 --> 1:13:47.840
 a lot of other tokens are not one of one but one of one art in the world at large is just called

1:13:47.840 --> 1:13:56.560
 art by a painting not an addition but one of one art is not one type of thing it's many types of

1:13:56.560 --> 1:14:01.360
 things again we have some great artists joining there we'll talk about that in five weeks i think

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:08.800
 next slide gaming nfts metaverse oriented nfts

1:14:08.800 --> 1:14:19.360
 this is not to say that we don't have these now we do but these are areas where people believe

1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:26.800
 that there's going to be tremendous growth and there's going to be tremendous growth in

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.880
 the coming years if you notice venture capital firms like entrees and Horowitz are funding

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:40.400
 an endless number of gaming studios to build blockchain centric gaming companies so i suspect

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:44.960
 we'll see a lot of development over the next few years here and learn a lot more than we know today

1:14:44.960 --> 1:14:55.200
 next slide utility-based NFTs are also an area that has not just a ton of potential but

1:14:55.200 --> 1:15:02.960
 almost completely unexplored the most famous one is bns the Ethereum name service where

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:10.080
 it is in some ways one of the most successful nfts collections the domains are nfts

1:15:13.760 --> 1:15:21.520
 and it is a blockchain based domain service where the domain itself is an NFT it's fabulously

1:15:21.520 --> 1:15:27.120
 smart it's super successful but you know the mint pass that you will use to attend this course

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:32.560
 that's also utility-based NFT there's a nice piece of art associated with it but the primary use of

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:37.280
 it is to be able to enter the core spaces to be able to mint your certificate at the end

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:45.280
 there's a lot of potential utility-based nfts that we mostly have not yet fully explored next

1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:58.400
 this is the back end of my prior chart when we start representing real world objects on chain

1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:08.000
 as i said for big important objects like real estate we need regulatory bridges or some type

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:11.600
 of enforcement bridges for people to feel comfortable what you're saying now is super

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:18.160
 interesting experimentation this is a project by gmoney where you mint an nft that nft represents

1:16:19.360 --> 1:16:24.160
 apparently an extremely fancy t-shirt i understand you can actually take possession of your

1:16:24.160 --> 1:16:29.040
 t-shirt or they can store it for you i don't i haven't dug into it in detail but we're at the

1:16:29.040 --> 1:16:37.280
 beginning of representation of visual objects as NFTs and it's logically going to start with

1:16:37.280 --> 1:16:43.520
 less expensive items like 300 t-shirts or expensive t-shirts but they are not actually

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:49.760
 highly expensive items in the house and as we learn more we'll move up the value chain into

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:54.400
 more and more expensive objects but this area has been truly almost completely unexplored

1:16:54.400 --> 1:17:00.400
 it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out next slide okay all of those are

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:06.000
 topics we are going to cover in the coming weeks i want to talk just for a couple of minutes on

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:14.320
 market structure to give a sense of where we are in overall size area of development what have you

1:17:15.440 --> 1:17:22.880
 the point that out this is in no way a comprehensive list of exchanges there are many more exchanges

1:17:22.880 --> 1:17:26.160
 but to me the most interesting thing about exchanges

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:38.240
 is in the nft space is that almost all of them operate on chain

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:44.480
 which means you have data that you just didn't have

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:49.840
 with traditional centralized exchanges

1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:56.080
 and traditional centralized exchanges report some data they might have an api they might

1:17:57.040 --> 1:18:05.360
 they might share some stats and figures but they're not showing you every trade

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:13.280
 that's in their own matching engine or whether it's open seer super rare looks rare

1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:20.640
 you can just go on the theorem blockchain and see every trade it's a level of transparency

1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:26.720
 that i don't think we've ever seen in markets and so this allows for a lot of data collection

1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:32.080
 to minimum but it also allows i think for a more interesting and competitive environment

1:18:32.800 --> 1:18:39.440
 looks rare when it launched in a form of what is known as a vampire attack on open sea it basically

1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:45.920
 dropped tokens on the large customers of open sea in the hope that this would

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:49.280
 incent them to move their business looks rare

1:18:51.360 --> 1:18:53.840
 well you can't actually do that in the centralized one right like

1:18:56.080 --> 1:19:03.600
 finance can't call up coinbase and say hey brian i'd really appreciate it if you'd send me your

1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:10.080
 customer list and in fact not just your customer list and their contact information but their bank

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:18.080
 accounts and also if you could be so kind as to rank all your customers in order profitability

1:19:18.080 --> 1:19:21.520
 because i really want to go after your profitable customers and take them from you

1:19:21.520 --> 1:19:27.360
 it'd be very much appreciated just just email it over me to hear yeah cz at finance.com right

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:34.880
 that's how it works this is like the most closely guarded data at one of these companies and in the

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:39.840
 nft world it's all out there in the open not only it's not closely guarded it is literally not

1:19:39.840 --> 1:19:47.840
 guarded at all it's on a public blockchain and once you've seen this it actually feels strange to

1:19:47.840 --> 1:19:57.120
 go back and if you're truly a believer in free markets if our regulatory system could get past

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:05.600
 its one-sided view of crypto we'll talk about that later and think about what this can mean for

1:20:05.600 --> 1:20:14.480
 capitalism for consumer surplus for actual free markets it's very good for consumers there's a

1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:20.000
 reason that transaction fees are low and dropping in these marketplaces they'll continue to drop

1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:27.760
 because you can compete and you can compete in a way that you know nobody can compete with the apple

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:35.200
 app store for apple devices so i think it's interesting that we'll have a pretty open and

1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:52.560
 transparent view of the trading in this space let's go to the next chart so this is a chart that

1:20:52.560 --> 1:21:02.720
 comes from a team at the University of Nicosia called nft valuations.com i'm an advisor to the

1:21:02.720 --> 1:21:08.400
 team a bunch of other six five to nine people advise the team they're trying to build up market

1:21:08.400 --> 1:21:20.320
 caps of various collections token by token and the market cap in a fungible collection is easier

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:23.840
 right you just take the number of bitcoins you take the last trades you multiply those two

1:21:23.840 --> 1:21:28.800
 together as you know that the market cap of bitcoin is 385 billion dollars or whatever it is

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:36.000
 the market cap of the crypto punks is hard because sometimes some are alien some are zombies some

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:44.160
 are humans some have hoodies some have mohawks some have the dreaded spotty face i mean what you need

1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:49.360
 to do is calculate the value of each one and then add it up and it's hard and on any given

1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:56.720
 and on any given token you might be wrong but i've seen the data that underlies this

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:01.520
 it's certainly more than good enough for the purposes of this chart right any particular token

1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:08.400
 might be wrong but in aggregate i think the mistakes cancel out and what it says that for

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:16.080
 pfps and generative art and this data does not include one of one art yet it does not include

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:23.600
 metaverse land except i think the other side land is in there um it does not include utility

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:32.400
 based which mostly don't exist except for ens and it does not include gaming but it does have

1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:38.960
 most of the major pfp and generative art collections the overall market cap is around 10 billion

1:22:38.960 --> 1:22:47.840
 dollars today at peak happiness in the crypto markets it was around 30 billion dollars

1:22:47.840 --> 1:22:59.520
 this matches my sense and so it's 10 billion maybe with the other sectors in it's 15 billion

1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:09.280
 something like that what is my takeaway from this the space is still absolutely tiny tiny

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:15.760
 fungible tokens are we're flirting with a trillion dollars recently in the peak they went almost

1:23:15.760 --> 1:23:22.880
 at three trillion i say this all the time to everyone i can find the only thing i'm a hundred

1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:30.480
 percent sure of is the current ratio of fungible token market cap and non fungible token market

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:38.960
 cap which is today about about a hundred to one that ratio is wrong i think that ratio is going

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:44.160
 to get closer every year i think one year they eventually they're going to be more or less the

1:23:44.160 --> 1:23:50.640
 same that might take a decade but they're going to be more or less the same and they're probably

1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:54.240
 going to be more or less the same at a higher number than we are today now

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:07.520
 i got pretty active in the bitcoin world in summer 2013 and in those days the market cap of bitcoin

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:16.160
 would you know go to five billion dollars and maybe all of the other altcoins maybe you'd get to 10

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:22.800
 billion i don't remember the details but it's in that range and this is what it actually feels to

1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:29.360
 me this is what the maturity of the space feels to me like it feels like 2013 era bitcoin it's

1:24:29.360 --> 1:24:37.280
 about that size it's still a fairly close community i tell people sometimes enjoy this is the time

1:24:37.280 --> 1:24:41.840
 where if you're really active in the space you can sort of kind of feel like you know everyone

1:24:41.840 --> 1:24:48.640
 you might not know them individually but you know of them that's going to change it's going to change

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:52.400
 fairly soon and it's going to change because the space is going to get bigger and it's a good thing

1:24:53.280 --> 1:25:00.400
 the space will get bigger it's a healthy thing but fairly soon you there'll be hundreds of things

1:25:00.400 --> 1:25:05.520
 going on all over the world in all types of sectors and sub sectors of NFTs and you'll have no idea

1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:10.640
 about them because you'll be focused on you know generative art in south america or something

1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:19.840
 but so i think the important takeaway it's still very early it means the space is also going to

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:27.680
 be hugely volatile all crypto assets are volatile bitcoins the least volatile theorems a little bit

1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:32.800
 more volatile the altcoins are more volatile than a theorem NFTs are more volatile than all of them

1:25:32.800 --> 1:25:38.640
 and that has to do with their level of maturity which is not very mature and by the way i just

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:44.880
 want to be clear and i reiterate George's not financial advice from the beginning

1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:52.880
 just because the NFT space today is 10 billion dollars and i think one day it's going to be

1:25:52.880 --> 1:25:57.600
 100 billion or a trillion it does not mean your NFTs are going to go up 10x or 100x

1:25:57.600 --> 1:26:03.360
 your specific NFT might go to zero and that market cap could be in a new NFT collection

1:26:04.080 --> 1:26:10.960
 NFTs do not have the same network effects that bitcoins right with bitcoin most of the value of

1:26:10.960 --> 1:26:18.320
 the money currency commodity store value usage case coalesced in one token that's definitely

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:24.160
 not going to happen in the NFTs space um NFTs represent a wide range of things we've been

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:30.160
 discussing so there's going to be a broad set of NFT tokens and collections that are carrying this

1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:37.680
 market cap the vast majority of them not yet invented so certain of course NFTs will do well

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:43.520
 over time but my perspective is not that the average NFT will do well over time economically

1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:47.120
 in fact my perspective is actually close to the opposite the average NFT will not do well over

1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:53.520
 time some of them will but most of them won't but what is absolutely the case is that NFTs

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:59.840
 as a category will do better and better and better every year um you know subject to the normal

1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:05.040
 macroeconomic and crypto market cycles let's go to the next page

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:19.920
 so these are the two different ways that they calculate market cap anyway there for these

1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:25.840
 purposes the same the interest is the thing i would point out is among the two categories

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:33.360
 PFPs and generative art most of the market caps and PFPs and it'll be very interesting

1:27:35.280 --> 1:27:38.880
 if anyone can come up with a reasonable estimate for the value of one of one art

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:43.840
 that's a very difficult problem because it basically never trades so we'll see what that looks like

1:27:43.840 --> 1:27:49.120
 but i'll be surprised if it's more than generative art right now i guess it's in the same range so

1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:53.760
 it does mean that even though a lot of people say like oh i don't know about PFPs maybe they're not

1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:59.120
 great most of the market cap the market in aggregate values PFPs more than anything else

1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:05.120
 that might be wrong we'll see but it's what the case is today an interesting sub point a lot of

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:13.840
 that market cap is in the Yuga collections or Bored mutant apes punks we have one of the co-founders

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:18.320
 of Yuga coming in a couple weeks we're going to discuss that and if that's healthy not healthy

1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:25.120
 what it means how that space evolves but today the things you should take away is the space is

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:30.960
 10 15 billion dollars most of it PFPs and as we'll see when we do the more detailed PFPs

1:28:30.960 --> 1:28:37.520
 most of it in fact yuga labs uh manage PFPs so let's go to the next bench

1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:44.320
 let's go to conclusions

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:54.560
 okay very very high level uh summary and i think we cover this in more detail but

1:28:55.520 --> 1:29:02.320
 NFTs are unique enumerated contracts that can live on smart contract blockchains

1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:09.760
 they will certainly there's already certainly representing a lot of intangible objects and

1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:15.840
 represent a lot more intangible objects and in time tangible objects the potential addressable

1:29:15.840 --> 1:29:29.280
 market is gigantic but the current NFT market is tiny so many exciting things have happened but it

1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:36.480
 is still super immature super experimental many things are going to fail there are many new things

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:41.920
 that we're going to invent along the way that have not been invented and so we're at the beginning

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:48.240
 of the beginning we'll have several cycles of up down and new inventions along the way over the

1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:53.600
 next you know over the next decade um let's see the next slide

1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:04.960
 we have put a little bit of extra greeting for those a little bit more technical you know

1:30:04.960 --> 1:30:12.160
 or you can go see some of these standards of how an NFT token is designed what are the design

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:18.480
 standards if you're not technical i think you're going to find the first four licks borderline

1:30:18.480 --> 1:30:24.960
 incomprehensible and i wouldn't worry about it you know if you're more technical and you'll want

1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:32.320
 to see the protocols it could be interesting a lot of these big picture ideas i tweet a lot

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:39.760
 and tweet storms and that's the link to all the tweet storms but we're working on trying to get

1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:44.240
 them in a format that people can read easier so at some point during the course we'll have

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:50.960
 that and i'll share it and some of these topics you know real estate and memes and what have you

1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:57.840
 are covered well in the tweet storms and so we'll make that available and then the data we just saw

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:05.040
 on market cap came out of a report that the nft valuations teams does have recorder

1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:11.200
 it's online there's a link there they have not learned to make it an nft yet we should harass

1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:18.400
 them to make it an nft um but right now it looks like it's just a pdf uh on their server but there

1:31:18.400 --> 1:31:24.640
 are some interesting facts and figures there to look at okay i think these are our official

1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:33.360
 slides i think incredibly George is going to come back here and what we're going to do is

1:31:34.160 --> 1:31:40.800
 answer some questions and hopefully the because hopefully the team has been pulling together

1:31:41.840 --> 1:31:50.400
 questions while we chat and um maybe we can spend George on 15 20 minutes answering questions

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:57.360
 something with them i think first of all thank you very much for this this was as always hugely

1:31:57.360 --> 1:32:03.760
 enlightening we are at the beginning of the beginning this is this is what what what i've kept

1:32:03.760 --> 1:32:10.480
 and i think we're gonna be coming back to this thing later on so first of all the team has been

1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:15.200
 active in the chat and they have been responding to people's questions

1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:24.720
 uh and covered many of them uh there are a couple of questions i can i could relate them to you

1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:30.720
 one is what are your thoughts about Manifold launching a gallery-themed marketplace yesterday

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:40.560
 um well first of all i would say i think manifold is great i think they have done

1:32:40.560 --> 1:32:51.840
 the best work of anyone in terms of helping the community realize it is doable manageable and

1:32:51.840 --> 1:33:03.920
 with the help of their tools easy enough to get um to launch on your own contract the I've used

1:33:03.920 --> 1:33:10.560
 Manifold contracts for several things i found their tools helpful so i think Manifold's great

1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:14.160
 i saw their announcement that they're going to make a marketplace

1:33:16.480 --> 1:33:20.320
 i think it's a logical move for them i think it is also

1:33:23.760 --> 1:33:29.360
 always a challenging business model marketplaces are very successful when they're successful

1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:39.040
 and tough to break into when you're new right so right now most

1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:47.360
 over the volume by far is on Opensea and that makes open sea an extraordinarily valuable

1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:58.320
 marketplace and there are endless teams coming from different angles to try and take some of

1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:05.520
 that market share and some of them have taken some market share but the competitive dynamics of

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:12.720
 who gets to be which win which part of the marketplace market share is probably the

1:34:12.720 --> 1:34:17.120
 single most competitive thing in NFTs right because it's the single most valuable prize

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:22.800
 if you can win it so i understand why they're doing it and i wish them luck because i think

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:28.560
 they're you know they're very good operators in the space they're promoting the right values but

1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:33.920
 it's also not a sure thing because breaking the liquidity of another marketplace is hard

1:34:37.600 --> 1:34:43.200
 okay thank you uh there's another question that i think i can take it's uh it's technical about

1:34:43.200 --> 1:34:48.880
 the course when will the airdrop occur i guess the question is about the airdrop of the material

1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:57.840
 for week one the answer is that we have already started airdropping course material the first

1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:04.480
 400 of you have already gotten the material this presentation in their wallets the reason

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:12.640
 for the delay has been that we basically broke the limit anything about the 19 000 airdrops

1:35:13.280 --> 1:35:18.160
 needed a special handling from us so we're doing it in batches so those of you that

1:35:18.160 --> 1:35:25.760
 have minted the course NFT you should expect this presentation dropping to your wallet in the next

1:35:25.760 --> 1:35:33.600
 couple of hours and then we're gonna be having multiple airdrops for the videos and everything

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:41.760
 else in the course please monitor our discord and Twitter you see both in the slide here because

1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:49.120
 we're gonna be announcing uh every time we're doing a an airdrop next question is actually very

1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:59.040
 interesting um is there a pull-up proof of attendance protocol uh uh to admit yeah

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:09.760
 i mean i think the answer is no right now right but it's a very good idea but it's a good idea

1:36:09.760 --> 1:36:16.400
 it's a very good idea and so um and so the

1:36:19.040 --> 1:36:25.440
 we should do it for some event yeah yeah let's make a note let's make a note for that and

1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:30.240
 get back to it it's a very good idea i think and some of the things that we are doing

1:36:31.200 --> 1:36:38.160
 especially with our guests might uh it might be a good thing for people to to have a proof

1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:44.480
 of attendance on on on these events and i think as we roll out the campus over the next few weeks

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:54.080
 this is going to become more pertinent um i can actually see the question chance myself so

1:36:54.640 --> 1:37:04.080
 oh nice nice um the our Amazon web service is responsible for storing all of our nfts well i

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:08.080
 don't know who our NFTs are but certainly not the ones for this course right the ones for these

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:17.200
 course are on our wave i believe correct so no no we are we're all about decentralization

1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:21.760
 and setting best practices so we will not be putting your NFTs on Amazon web services

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:28.800
 another similar technical question people asked why did we make the mint passes

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:36.800
 as prc 720 ones not 1155s and the answer is so we can track individuals right like so people can

1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:47.360
 say this is the one that i got here and i did this over time when an 1155 doesn't 1155 is

1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:54.000
 non fungible within is fungible within the context of a specific token right so if we want to say

1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:00.880
 a student one two three four did these 18 things over the course of the semester

1:38:02.080 --> 1:38:10.160
 we need a 721 to do that George is that correct sir accurate yes yes i think it's a it's an accurate

1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:17.040
 description uh there's a similar question that says if i transfer my course nft to another

1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:24.480
 wallet where the airdrops come to the new wallet the answer is they should we as i've said in the

1:38:24.480 --> 1:38:31.680
 beginning we are we're experimenting there we've done our tests at limited scale today if i'm not

1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:40.720
 mistaken we have had up to 3000 people joining us live we have more than 20 000 wallets uh connected

1:38:40.720 --> 1:38:47.920
 and uh minting the the course access token so what we're doing is we are we're querying uh the

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:57.840
 contract and we're looking at transfers so we should be able to airdrop the uh the nfts to the

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:06.400
 current holder of the token this means that if you have minted your course access nft and then

1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:14.160
 you transferred it to another wallet all future airdrops will happen to the new wallet however

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:18.960
 if there have been airdrops to the previous one obviously these are not going to be automatically

1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:24.400
 transferred you would have to either leave them in the old wallet or manually transfer them there

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:31.440
 i don't see why the team couldn't snapshot the new wallets for airdrops allow lists things like

1:39:31.440 --> 1:39:39.920
 that so i think we'll be okay yeah i think uh on that topic the oh i lost the chat

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:49.360
 oh here's a very good question are you going to issue soulbound nfts for students who have

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:56.240
 completed the course very good it's a very good question we have our initial view but we're going

1:39:56.240 --> 1:40:01.360
 to think about it over the course of the semester and give a final answer at the end of the semester

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:10.240
 but my general view is no we will not make them soulbound because my general view is let's say

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:20.640
 you want to hold this uh certificate for the next 40 years of your life there's zero chance you will

1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:26.880
 not change wallets during that period in fact you will probably change wallets many many many

1:40:26.880 --> 1:40:32.640
 times during that period and if you want so either that means you're going to be stuck

1:40:33.200 --> 1:40:40.320
 maintaining an old wallet for the rest of your life just to hold a course nft or the University

1:40:40.320 --> 1:40:47.520
 of Nicosia is going to have to provide customer support for the rest of your life where they'll

1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:53.680
 have to verify that you are now that new person in another wallet to transfer which seems quite

1:40:53.680 --> 1:41:02.480
 difficult so we um we think they will not be soulbound but probably once we get to the last

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:08.000
 few weeks of the course we'll come out with our logic on that and how specifically we think about

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:18.400
 doing that fair George yeah i think it's fair i as you said i too haven't made up my mind 100

1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:25.040
 percent about the uh the applicability of soulbound tokens for university degrees and

1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:32.400
 certificates but given that long term there's as you said zero chance that people will not be

1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:39.360
 migrating to new wallets and so on and so forth i think the default option should be that these

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:47.440
 things should be transferable uh now we need to figure out how we can make them transferable but

1:41:47.440 --> 1:41:53.840
 not sellable because obviously we don't want people to to to go in a marketplace and sell

1:41:53.840 --> 1:42:00.000
 their their degree to others uh that's that's totally an open question uh we have some

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:08.480
 thoughts on that too but i think we should start with with a non soulbound token and and uh you

1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:19.520
 know be convinced otherwise um next question are you scared of big brand style of centralization

1:42:20.240 --> 1:42:26.080
 or should we embrace because there's truly room for both so the answer that question is yes and yes

1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:37.200
 i had many arguments discussions healthy debate vigorous debate on Twitter about this topic when

1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:43.120
 big brands issued nfts right and a lot of people said well we don't like it that Adidas did an

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:51.760
 nft draw we want to be here for the independent artists right and i'll answer the second question

1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:56.800
 first first of all it's a permissionless network anyone just like an independent artist can

1:42:56.800 --> 1:43:01.920
 issue an nft Adidas can issue an NFT and they don't have to ask our permission to do so right

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:07.360
 and if a lot of people went and spend a lot of money on the Adidas NFT and it suggests that people

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:13.040
 want the Adidas NFT right if everyone really didn't want the Adidas NFT it wouldn't have been to them

1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:19.920
 right it can't be like it's very very bad a lot of people bought it if a lot of people bought it

1:43:19.920 --> 1:43:25.520
 a lot of people wanted but to me and my things that i care about which is ensuring that our

1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:34.080
 digital world in the future the metaverse is decentralized well if Adidas doesn't issue an nft

1:43:35.360 --> 1:43:41.120
 it's not like the alternative is Adidas will not participate in the digital economy Adidas

1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:46.000
 will participate in the digital economy anyway and they will issue some type of digital collectible

1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:52.160
 on Facebook and the same people who like Adidas and buy Adidas shoes will buy the digital collectible

1:43:52.160 --> 1:44:00.240
 on facebook and adidas will earn the same amount of money from doing this and promote centralization

1:44:00.880 --> 1:44:09.600
 whereas if Adidas issues on an nft instead Adidas and its market power is promoting decentralization

1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:15.840
 so between the two there's no actual option to say Adidas should stop earning revenue and people

1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:20.320
 should stop spending money on Adidas right they will this is going to happen and so if that's

1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:26.080
 the case do we want them on our decentralized quote unquote rails or do we want them on someone

1:44:26.080 --> 1:44:35.200
 else's centralized rails i prefer that they come with us now does this create a risk that people might

1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:45.040
 or big brands might successfully centralize the space yes for sure the big brands are excellent

1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:50.960
 meme makers they're excellent myth makers they have millions of customers they have years of

1:44:50.960 --> 1:45:00.400
 marketing people like them and so there is a window now where new crypto native communities brands

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:05.440
 ideas can emerge but that window won't be open forever right eventually the big brands are going

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:11.520
 to come and they are going to be successful and we have to in the meantime stand up some of our own

1:45:11.520 --> 1:45:19.280
 brands some of our own communities some of our own ethos to be able to hold their own with them

1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:28.800
 it's also why i sometimes laugh when you know people think that certain artists and

1:45:31.360 --> 1:45:38.400
 certain artists are minting too much or becoming too big none of this is true

1:45:38.400 --> 1:45:45.600
 everything in the nft space all together is still a rounding error versus the big brands big

1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:55.520
 society centralized society and so forth um this if we want to be successful in the world of large

1:45:55.520 --> 1:46:02.640
 we have to get bigger all of the big nft native brands need to get bigger so that when we're 15

1:46:02.640 --> 1:46:08.400
 years talking about Disney and Nike and Adidas and apple we're also talking about 10 other

1:46:09.360 --> 1:46:15.120
 brands that got built in this era and that have decentralization as their underlying ethos

1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:21.120
 otherwise all that's going to happen is only the big brands will go away there's no version

1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:34.160
 where we can only stay small i don't i don't think that actually happens

1:46:36.800 --> 1:46:42.320
 okay i think there's a related question regarding to regarding big brands uh whether

1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:48.000
 they will be in the path of decentralization the future so for example if you see Facebook

1:46:48.000 --> 1:46:52.400
 or Twitter become decentralized in a few years from now what are your thoughts on this

1:46:53.280 --> 1:47:01.200
 well is that the question about tech companies being decentralized or is it about brands being

1:47:01.200 --> 1:47:05.760
 decentralized so i think well the first part of the question is about brands and then the example

1:47:05.760 --> 1:47:11.120
 that the student offers is about Facebook and Twitter but i think we can take both um

1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:23.600
 um okay one second so let's take brands first because this is

1:47:26.640 --> 1:47:36.640
 a very interesting topic the i think of something like nouns right nouns is trying to build

1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:44.960
 a very decentralized brand right they are they have their nouns glasses and they're of course token

1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:58.880
 based and the actual imagery is cc zero public domain imagery and so anyone can use their brand

1:47:58.880 --> 1:48:04.640
 imagery and punk 4156 who's one of the founders there is going to come on the course later in

1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:12.160
 the semester to talk about this and i think his view is that network brands that take advantage

1:48:12.160 --> 1:48:19.200
 of tokens and social media and public domain ip will actually emerge and be able to compete with

1:48:19.200 --> 1:48:24.880
 big brands because they'll use the power of networks it's a very interesting question it's a very

1:48:24.880 --> 1:48:32.160
 interesting experiment nobody has nobody knows how it's going to play out but i very much look forward

1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:37.040
 to seeing it now to another question you know will we have decentralized social media in effect

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:48.880
 i think the answer is yes i've also thought that for many years and i think it's less likely that

1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:55.520
 it's because Twitter will become decentralized on the blockchain or have you in fact ilan must

1:48:55.520 --> 1:49:01.920
 yesterday said specifically that he does not want to do that he does not think the scalability is

1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:07.360
 there uh to run a Twitter like service on blockchain whether he's right or wrong that's what he believes

1:49:07.360 --> 1:49:17.840
 sounds to me that ilan wants to build the western we chat uh but i do think some version will emerge

1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:24.000
 but it's like the marketplace question Twitter has gigantic network effects

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:29.920
 Facebook has gigantic network effects what is the thing that is interesting enough

1:49:29.920 --> 1:49:36.000
 to pull people away and my guess is with always these things it's not going to be twitter 2.0

1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:40.800
 and there's a lot of people trying to make Twitter 2.0 trying to make twitter but decentralized

1:49:40.800 --> 1:49:48.880
 and i wish them the best and i hope it works but my gut sense is people get disrupted not by just

1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:53.680
 the exact same version of what they are but decentralized they get disrupted by something

1:49:53.680 --> 1:49:58.560
 that they don't think is a competitor at first they look at something say okay this is not a

1:49:58.560 --> 1:50:02.800
 competitor i think the thing that will disrupt Twitter is something that when twitter sees it

1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:07.120
 on day one and year one i was saying this is not a competitor to me at all i don't have to worry about

1:50:08.080 --> 1:50:12.320
 and it's going to come from a completely different angle that architecture will be decentralized

1:50:12.880 --> 1:50:18.320
 and then one day it will be taking market share from Twitter in the same way that Twitter today

1:50:18.320 --> 1:50:23.520
 takes market share from the new york times and at some point you know 15 years ago if you told the

1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:30.720
 new york times you are going to lose market share and brand share and setting the agenda for the

1:50:30.720 --> 1:50:38.640
 world share to Twitter it would be a laughable proposition and yet it happened and so i think

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:45.040
 it won't happen but probably not in a direct clone but i wish the direct clones luck and maybe

1:50:45.040 --> 1:50:49.680
 hopefully some of them will work i've supported some of them a direct clone would also be helpful

1:50:49.680 --> 1:50:54.480
 and but i think it's going to look a little different

1:50:58.400 --> 1:51:05.280
 okay we are we're closing to two hours i know we've said that its live session would be one hour

1:51:05.280 --> 1:51:12.320
 long but I guess this one was would have to be longer anyway because we needed to cover the

1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:18.960
 course logistics as well i think we've covered most of the questions that were related to this

1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:26.800
 week's material i see a number of questions in the chat but they are related to stuff that we will

1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:36.640
 cover in the future we have another 11 weeks ahead of us so let's not cover everything today

1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:45.520
 i guess we could wrap it up at this point uh six five to nine any final parting thoughts

1:51:45.520 --> 1:51:53.200
 because before i give people a few uh practical pointers to the future no i think it's great

1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:58.320
 look we have i don't know 30 40 50 sessions in bound so we'll have plenty of time to cover a lot

1:51:58.320 --> 1:52:05.760
 of topics if you are not following the unique metaverse Twitter account and discord please do

1:52:05.760 --> 1:52:10.640
 for now this is probably the only centralized part in the infrastructure and we're trying to think

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:15.600
 about how to eliminate that as well but for the next few weeks i think that is real it's a real

1:52:15.600 --> 1:52:24.000
 thing and so do follow it and there are going to be ongoing developments every few days so keep an eye

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:31.040
 there so you know you know what's going to happen absolutely we're going to be using both

1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:37.040
 twitter and discord to announce things almost on a daily basis because we're we're building

1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:43.280
 uh around the clock so as six five to nine said please follow us on Twitter and make sure that you

1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:49.600
 uh keep an eye on discord especially in the announcements uh discord is our primary

1:52:50.240 --> 1:52:57.360
 course support channel as well uh you can email us at metaverse@unic.ac.cy

1:52:58.320 --> 1:53:05.120
 although i would uh say that discord will probably result in an in a faster resolution

1:53:05.120 --> 1:53:11.920
 of whatever issue you have uh i would like to remind everyone that the next live session for week

1:53:11.920 --> 1:53:17.520
 two which uh is going to be about copyright and provenance will take place on Wednesday

1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:26.240
 so that's October the 12th same time five p.m eastern European standard time Cyprus time uh so

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:34.000
 looking forward to seeing everyone then uh in the meantime uh have fun and uh keep an eye on your

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:39.440
 wallets because we're going to be air dropping uh lots of things uh to to your wallets in the coming

1:53:39.440 --> 1:53:57.280
 days bye bye everyone bye bye bye
