Hello, friends. Welcome to the University of Nicosia. Welcome to the Open Metaverse.I'm George Giaglis and it's a real honor and a pleasure to welcome you all here today.I'm really excited to see hundreds of people from all over the world joining us. This isa truly historic day as we all come together for the first live session of the world'sfirst ever university level course that will take place entirely on-chain and in the metaverse.I couldn't be prouder to have with me as a co-instructor in the 12-week journey that we starttoday, Punk 6529, who is undoubtedly the world's leading authority and a visionary thinker in thefield of NFTs, the Open Metaverse and the future of our decentralized world. I am so proud to counthim among my mentors. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the more than 50 investors,artists, collectors, entrepreneurs and thinkers that have kindly agreed to share their uniqueinsights into NFTs and the metaverse with us over the next weeks. I cannot honestly think of anyuniversity course ever that has had such an impressive lineup of invited speakersand I'm sure that I will be learning from them as much as everyone else here today.Special thanks also to my amazing team at UNIC who are constantly breaking new groundand always give their very best to support our students and the educational experience thatwe'll be having over the coming weeks. And last but not least, a big thanks to Ryan,Mungi and the whole team at Oncyber for making all this possible and for working around the clockwith 6529 and the UNIC team to create an awesome metaverse experience for everyone.Right, so before we begin with session one, let me bring up our presentation to take you quicklythrough the logistics of the course. So, as you know, the course will be running for 12 weeks.Each week there will be a presentation like the one that you are looking at now. This will includefurther reading material for those of you interested in it. We will also have a live sessionlike the one we're having today and we will have starting next week one or more additionalguest lecturers or interviews or panels. All material, including this live session, will be recorded.Everything will be available to watch on demand for those of you that cannot attend live eitherfor due to time zone constraints or some other reason. At the end of the course, there will bean assessment. The assessment will be different for those of you that are already students at theUniversity of Nicosia and want to take academic credit from this course. You will have to do totake a qualitative assessment. Everybody else who simply wants to receive an NFT in the form of aprofessional certificate issued by the University of Nicosia will have to pass an online multiplechoice test with a score of 60 % or more. As I've said, the course is being led by Punk 6529and I'm going to be helping him whenever I can, but obviously such an experimental new coursecouldn't have been possible without the help of many people from our team, both at the Universityof Nicosia and from the team of 6529. In this slide, you can see the members of the teamthat are the main contacts for this course. We have introduced them in the pre-course last week.You can find their Twitter handle and Discord username for all of them, so please refer to thisslide and talk to them either in Discord or on Twitter for anything that you need relating tothis course. All of them are with you today in the OM and are monitoring the chat, so they willbe taking on questions that they can as we go along. Let me say a few words about the Universityof Nicosia because I'm sure judging from the multitude of countries where everybody's comingfrom, many of you might not know us. We are the largest English-speaking university in SouthernEurope. We are a comprehensive university. We have more than 14,500 students across more than 100degree undergraduate and postgraduate programs. We are ranked top 3% globally and among the topthat have received five stars in the QS assessment about our online teaching. Our campus in Nicosiaconsists of more than 20 different buildings, among them probably the world's most beautifuland iconic student accommodations ever. But apart from the people that we haveon site in the university, we are very active online and we are particularly active in the fieldof crypto. We have always been a global pioneer in this space. We were the first university inthe world to accept Bitcoin for tuition payments. We were the first to launch a course in crypto,our free MOOC, the introduction to digital currencies taught by Andreas Antonopoulos,Antonis Polimitis and myself has been continuously running since 2013. It was the first course everin the world and we are proud to have trained more than 80,000 students from more than 120countries until today. We were the first to offer a full academic degree in this area. Our master'sin blockchain and digital currency started in 2014 and is still the world's largest program incrypto. We were the first university ever to issue our certificates as blockchain verifiablecredentials. We started in 2015 with our MOOC alumni. Then in 2017 we moved to issue all thedegrees that are awarded by the University of Nicosia. They are now awarded on the issued onthe blockchain. Last year we started issuing certificates also in the form of NFTs on theEthereum blockchain. We have the largest dedicated crypto team in academia globally, in ourInstitute for the Future. We do basic and applied research working with many crypto projects aswell as institutional partners like the European Commission or the European Central Bank. We aspireto become the first university in the metaverse having launched this course today in partnershipwith Punk 6529 and hopefully we will be aiming a new full academic degree in metaverse systemsnext year. Now having said that trying to be first at something is always a challengingendeavor so this course and the whole learning experience is going to be a big bet for us and Ithink it's going to be a learning experience for everybody. We've frequently said that this is thefirst university course to be held on chain and in the metaverse. Let me take a second to explainwhat we mean. By on chain we mean that our internal bet is to try to do as much as possible in thiscourse without touching upon any centralized information system of the university. That's whywe did not ask you to register in a web page and give us your full name and contact details and emailor whatever. We asked you to mint an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain and this NFT will becomeyour ticket to access the class. We aim to have all material available in the form of NFTs soeverything will be air-dropped to your wallets so those of you that have minted the course accesstoken I would encourage you to transfer that token to a separate wallet that you controlbecause on that wallet will be air-dropping a number of things including this presentation,interviews, panels, discussions, everything that we're going to be doing in this course.By the end of this course you will have a full portfolio of material inside your Ethereumwallet. That's what on chain means and in the metaverse obviously means that we're going to beusing the OM to do that. Today we are using the open space of OM. We are here in this beautiful parkbut starting in the coming weeks we will be gradually revealing parts of the metacampusthat we are building in the OM. We're going to be holding future activities in auditoriums,in special learning facilities, we're going to have exhibition rooms, we're going to experimentwith many modalities within the metaverse and we would like to have you with us in this journey.We expect to have some hiccups in the beginning of the course and probably even later as we'reconstantly breaking new ground. Please get back to us, tell us what you think, what works wellfor you, what doesn't work well for you. If you have any feedback or ideas or you would like tohelp us in making this experience better for everyone we are open to your suggestions on Discord,on Twitter and in the chat here. A quick technical tip for those of you thatare connected through mobile you will make most of your experience if you connect through a desktopenvironment and if you connect through a laptop please make sure that you set it up so that yourbrowser uses your dedicated graphics card if you have one to render the world that you are seeingin the OM. Many laptops would by default use their internal graphics card and you might havea lesser experience. Having said that because we have hundreds of people we have made the designchoice today to create separate rooms. Each room consists of around 300 people so that we do nothave hundreds and hundreds of people in the same space to avoid any performance issues.In the future as we become more comfortable with the performance of the world and the environmentwe will be bringing more and more people in the same instance as well. I'm saying that becauseas we go along and especially in the Q&A session some of you might hear either 6529 or me talkingabout a question in the chat that you might have not seen in the chat and will be wondering what'shappened. The reason is that there are separate chats in each of the rooms so each group of 300people or less are looking at a different chat and we are combining everything together in ourcurrent. Another thing that I would like to stress is that everything that you see in thiscourse coming from the University of Nicosia is released under a Creative Commons AttributionLicense which means that you are totally free to reuse the presentation materials and everythingelse that we produce in this course as long as you attribute back to the University of Nicosia.So you can take this slide use them as they are or modify them so long as you attribute that thesource was the University of Nicosia in this course. Obviously this release has to do only withintellectual property that comes from UNIC and not intellectual property from other parties.All the presentations will be available on our Github and all the presentations will be mintedas NFTs and air-dropped to your wallets. Obviously this is an educational course only.We will be discussing various projects, various people, various NFTs. None of this is investmentadvice. None of this is a recommendation to either buy or sell an NFT. I hope that this isclear to everyone but I had to set it. If you are new to crypto, note that we are at the frontierof investment classes here and any investments at all at Island should be made only after carefulresearch and probably after consulting a professional advisor. As you have seen in the website,we have a 12-week schedule ahead of us. We are in the first week now so we're just going to belaying the ground, the background and making sure that everyone is on the same page aboutwhat is an NFT and why all these things are important. Each week we're going to be dealingwith a specific subject either on NFTs until week seven or related to the metaverse from week eightonwards. That was it in terms of the logistics of the course and let's go to session one.Session one is a challenging session in the sense that we have a very diverse group ofstudents obviously. There have been more than 20,000 people that have minted the course access NFTand we're super happy about that but obviously some of you are very new to this area and someothers are at the other end of the spectrum. You might already be developing or collecting NFTsand hence you know much of the background information. The goal for today is just to createa common language about NFTs with everyone. Some of you will find today's presentation verystraightforward or even simplistic. Others might find it very difficult. The presentation willconsist of two parts. I will start with a brief technical overview to define NFTs and discusssome of the standards for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain and then I'm going to hand overto 6529 who will take us through the different types of NFTs, their use cases, examples ofinteresting collections and explore the market size and structure for NFTs. Let me start witha technical discussion. I'm going to try to keep it as simple as possible and not go througheverything that you see in the slides. You can read them at your own time. First of all,I hope it's clear to everyone that NFTs live exist on blockchains. If you are not familiarwith the concept of a blockchain, a distributed network of computers processing transactionsin a peer-to-peer manner, grouping them into blocks and appending them into a chain, then Iwould suggest that you follow our introduction to digital currencies MOOC, the link to whichyou can find at the bottom of this slide. NFTs live on blockchains and so we could bespending time here discussing the different types of blockchains, but we decided to keep thingssimple to just base the discussion on one of them, the Ethereum blockchain. I'd like to startby discussing what Ethereum is. Ethereum is what we could call a second-generation blockchain thatis capable of running applications. I'm using the term second-generation to differentiate it fromBitcoin, which everybody considers as the prime example of the first-generation blockchain. Bitcoinis an open public and permissionless network of computers. This means that anyone can joinjust by downloading some software and connecting to the network, but Bitcoin is single-use.The only thing that the Bitcoin blockchain is doing is effectively processing the Bitcoin token,so the blockchain and the token have the same name. Ethereum is a second-generation blockchainnetwork that is similar and very different to Bitcoin at the same time. It's similar becauseit's also an open permissionless public blockchain and also has its own token. It's called Ether.Many people call the token Ethereum as well, but technically Ethereum is the blockchain andEther is the token. However, unlike Bitcoin, this is a blockchain in which we can program and runapplications. Very simplistically, you can think of Ethereum as the Internet of decentralizedapplications, a global network of computers that can run any application without needs forintermediaries. You can have the functionality of Facebook without having Facebook, the companymediating the transactions. You can have e-commerce without Amazon or some other provider,and this is what is most revolutionary about these types of blockchains. How is this possible?It's possible because Ethereum and other similar blockchains run what we call smart contracts,and smart contracts are computer programs that run on the blockchain and are immutable. Immutablemeans that they cannot change, and this is a very powerful characteristic. I cannot overstate theimportance of this characteristic. We have programs that once we hit run and we deploy them on theEthereum blockchain, they cannot be stopped or modified or nothing even by their owner. Technically,the owner can keep them in a state that is changeable, but I hope you will forgive the simplicityhere. The promise of having such immutable code running on a blockchain is nothingshort of revolutionary because now, for the first time in history, we have the ability to programany interaction between parties that is automatable, program it in a smart contract,and be trusted to run as programmed without intermediaries and without censorship,without anyone being able to stop it. This opens up the possibility to all sorts of applications.The other difference of Ethereum is that it is a multi-token network. As I've said,it has its own native currency, Ether, but on Ethereum, we can also create additional tokens.Some of these tokens are fungible and they follow a standard that we call ERC20,and others are non-fungible or NFTs, and they follow different standards like ERC721 or ERC1155.Fungibility is a property that has to do with whether different units of some asset are exchangeableor not. When we say that a token is fungible, we mean that any two units of that token have thesame value. If you have one Ether and I have one Ether, this Ether, in theory, should have the samedollar value, but non-fungible tokens are unique. They are different from each other. If you havea CryptoPunk and I have a CryptoPunk, the value of our Punks is generally not the same becauseeach token has its own properties, so some of them might be more valuable than others.As I've said, there are three major standards in Ethereum governing token creation.One of them is outside the scope of this course. ERC20 is the most popularstandard and it deals with fungible tokens. The other two, ERC721 and ERC1155 were bothreleased in 2018 and they both deal with NFTs. ERC721 is the most widely used standard for NFTstoday. ERC1155 is a more complex version that allows us to create smart contracts that managemultiple token types at the same time. These tokens could be fungible, non-fungible or hybrid.ERC20 is, as I've said, outside the scope of this course, so tokens like Uniswap, Sushi,Tether, USDC, Manna, or Raptether that you see in this slide basically deal with various typesof financial applications, so we're not going to be dealing with them. If you are interestedin fungible tokens, then we've got you covered. We have another MOOC that I'm also teaching with agroup of colleagues from the University of Nicosia on decentralized finance. You can access thisat the link that you see at the bottom of this page and it's a totally free course.What we are going to be dealing with are the standards that are used to implementnon-fungible tokens. The simplest of that is ERC721. It provides basic standard functionalitythat developers need in order to manage, track, and transfer NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.Technically, you would need to write computer codes in a smart contract programming languagelike Solidity to do that, but in practice, most creators today would use some third-party servicethat would allow them to create their collections without writing code or with very little programminginvolved. ERC1155 is Ethereum's multi-token standard. If you see the first three bullets inthis slide, they provide the basic difference between the main standards. If I wanted to createan ERC20 token, a fungible token, I would create a different smart contract for each token.So, Tether has its own smart contract and Uniswap has a totally different smart contract for theUnit token. ERC721 allows me to have different tokens in a single contract. So, I have punk6529and punk6530, which are different tokens, but are managed within the same contractwith different meta data, different attributes for each of the tokens. But all the attributesare defined at the smart contract level. So, whether my crypto punk is male or female or alienor an APE is defined in an attribute in the smart contract. And ERC1155 takes this idea of beingable to create meta data and attributes for your tokens, not at the collection level, but at thelevel of the individual token, at the token ID. And this is something that is very important whenyou want to create more complex applications, for example, in gaming. We'll discuss gaming laterin this course, so I'm not going to go into details. This is a table that summarizes thedifferences between the two main standards for NFTs on Ethereum. Now, and I will finish with this,if I wanted for you to take one thing away from today's lecture, the technical part of it at least,is this slide. Many people, even people that are quite knowledgeable in NFTs, have a veryfuzzy idea or have never thought about how, where are their NFTs really stored. And what I would liketo emphasize here is that in most cases, storing big data on the blockchain is very expensive.So, if I created a collection of 10,000 images that each of them, you know, is a few megabytesworth of information, it would be very, very expensive to store the images themselves andtransact with the images on the blockchain. So, instead, the token that you own, when you own anNFT token, like the course access token that you minted here, effectively you own a pointerto a URI, a Uniform Resource Identifier, like a web page link, that points to where the actual imageor the actual content of the NFT, because it might not be an image, it might not be a video,it might be this live session, is actually stored. And when dealing with storage, we have two options.We can either store our NFTs in a centralized server or we can store them in a decentralized way.And what usually happens is that in the NFT field, if we have to choose between centralized anddecentralized types of storages, always decentralized is better. So, two examples ofdifferent philosophies that do the same thing, distributed storage of NFTs, is IPFS and ARWAVE.ARWAVE is the standard that we are using in this course, but IPFS is equally good and they bothprovide ways in which the actual image and its metadata for your NFTs are not stored in a singlecentral location, but are shared by thousands of computers worldwide so that you have additionalsecurity that nobody can mess with your NFT unless the whole network goes down.Now, in some rare cases, we might even see NFTs that are stored natively on chain and this meansthat the actual image and its metadata are stored on the blockchain. This is obviously the best casescenario. It preserves all the first order features of the blockchain, so you have reallyimmutable, decentralized NFTs with no single point of failure and all the other attributes thatthose of you familiar with blockchains will know about, but they tend to be very expensive,as I've said, so you would see them only when you can somehow compress the data. For example,in generative art, as we will be discussing in a couple of weeks from now, this is a decentchoice to store your NFTs natively on chain. If you have one of one art or photography orvideography or anything else that creates large files, this is probably not feasible.So what I want you to remember again is that when you own an NFT, effectively you own a tokenthat is a pointer to some location in which the actual file is saved and whether this is on chain,off-chain decentralized or off-chain centralized matters a lot, this is going to be a big themein this course. Okay, so this concludes the technical primer and I'm going to behanding over to the man that you've been waiting for. Punk 6529 is with us and I'm going to givethe floor to him to discuss what our NFTs are. So 6529, if you can hear us.Okay, fantastic. Well, first of all, I want to do my own round of thank you's toeveryone who has brought us to this point. First of all, George and his team, the team on oncyber,the team at 6529, the broader team at the University of Nicosia that has helped evenfolks who are not in the blockchain area have been helping. The audio visual team is helping ushere today and of course all the incredible guests, lecturers, panelists that are going to be joiningduring these next 12 weeks. So thank you. This is a group effort. It's a team effort and theoverall experience is going to be not just a group and team effort among the people who are workingon this course but also with the students. One of the things we are trying to understand here,one of my deep interests in trying to understand, is in fact what we can do on chain and in themetaverse. My general perspective is that we have been a little bit intellectually lazy in thecrypto world about how much we can actually use decentralized systems. The vast majority of peopleuse cryptocurrency for realistically financial speculation and sometimes things like transactions.Part of what got me very excited about NFTs in addition to seeing great art and wonderfulartists was that the NFT world in great contrast to the fungible token world was spending a lotof time on chain and was doing new functions on chain. Last week we were minting QQLs atin cryptocurrency and I believe for cryptocurrency to make it, for decentralized walkchains to makeit, we have to have real-life usage cases that are something more than we're going to hold on tothese tokens and the number is going to go up. I've mentioned this before on Twitter, I learnedby doing things and yes I'm going to be sharing some material and I think the students will learnsome things from the material that I will share but I also hope to learn from this course andspecifically what I want to learn is what does it mean to have a large group of people engage inyou know broadly a course and do it without using a centralized database. What does it mean if we'redoing a class in the metaverse but more importantly what does it mean if we're going to run a communityfocused on learning about NFTs or working in the NFT space or thinking of new ideas in the NFT spaceand what does that mean in a persistent three-dimensional environment.While I think today's experience is super interesting and I've been enjoying watching it and watchingGeorge and lurking in the background in one of the rooms I think the more interesting thing overthe course of the next few months is what we are all as a group going to do outside the classroom.I think there will be an exercise an iterative exercise of seeing what people want to do,trying to build these spaces that enable them to do it. George mentioned the campus is beingbuilt and the OM teams doing a lot of support there and one of the reasons the campus is not readyis just because it's not ready but the other reason that it's not ready is we want to take a designiterative design approach there, and launch a certain set of spaces see how we use them see what otherneeds we have see what spaces are needed to support those needs and what would be a great successfor me at the end of the year is not only that we've had some nice panels and lecturesbut there are groups of people who have met in this course have become a part of this communityand are planning all types of interesting things to do together, that we can find people toalso educate in parallel with this course. We stopped at 50-ishlectures because the logistics were starting to get out of hand but there's a lot more people whowant to contribute and part of what we're trying to figure out once we get past these first coupleof weeks is how to let them contribute in parallel with the course. I noticed this when I was workingon my set of slides. These slides, if you're deep into the crypto space today's are the NFT spaceand you have a crypto background today's session is super easy but I was trying to think if we'retrying to onboard someone new here someone who is excited about the NFT world or the metaverse worldbut does not have a deep understanding of crypto well we are trying to cover everything from bitcointo ethereum to smart contracts to where do you store an NFT to what is the market cap of thespace what are the subsections of space in a few slides, it's not possible and so what I'd like toget to is parallel tracks people doing not every single person has to come to every session butthat over the next few weeks we have a campus an educational area, where people are learning all thetime there's no bigger barrier to our development and education there's never a limit on how muchwe can learn I've been in the space for a very long time and I learn new things literally every dayand there's people at different levels of development and they're going to learn things,every day as well and so we're trying to enable something like, auniversity of old right where you went there and you're learning you're living there and you areaiming to learn from your colleagues and those students and the faculty and the visitors butwith the great benefit that we can do it globally for the whole world at the same time and sothis is the spirit of this course, and this means that we're going to need your feedback for sureyour help for sure and your initiatives for sure to figure out how to do all these things and figureout what are the things you want to do and so where you know reach out on twitter on discordfeel free to organize things I think in two to three weeks once we have the basics working,we're going to be very open to people coming and saying hey I want to do aspecial lecture specifically on the details of how IPFS works, and we will say yes the answer isgoing to be yes the answer is let's do more let's find a way for everyone to be able to share theknowledge that they have and for people to learn that knowledge so this is my view of let's say thecourse philosophy now in this and the time that I have today I'd like to do one and a half things.What I really want to focus on is my big picture conceptual idea of what NFTs areconceptual the rest of my slides are things like well what are the sectors of the NFT space PFPsor generative art one of ones we're going to fly through this fly through those today, because foreach of those areas we have a session later in the course, so I'm not going to spend almostany time on PFPs today because we have a whole session in two weeks on PFPs and we'll dig intothe micro details there so I'm going to focus on the first set of my slides and see if we can getsome big picture ideas communicated with that that's a great lead into this slide,in a way the way I see NFTs it is the most absurdly trivially simple idea,literally the only thing an NFT actually is, is a token with a number they are enumerated tokens,they are tokens where you can identify one token and it is different than another token,this sounds I mean if you think about it at this most basic level and if you,think about if this is important. It sounds very unimportant, I'm trying to imagine if this wasseveral years ago and someone told me oh this is a really important idea you know what's the ideawe're going to have tokens and we're going to put numbers on them. I'm pretty sure okay wellthat doesn't sound very important why is that important okay cool, I guess right what we'reseeing here on the slide are the three-six-sequential tokens that on the crypto punks contract thatincludes 6529 so in my theorem wallet is punk 6528 crypto punk tokens 6529 and there's also 6528and there's a 6530. That's all NFTs are and it's weird because it's one of those that is deceptivelysimple because it actually enables a huge number of things, let's go to the next slide.Because the other part of NFTs you will not find on a blockchain the other important part of NFTsis a social convention. People who don't understand NFTs well often make criticisms ofthe following genre but NFTs are just a receipt, they're just a pointer they're not the thingthey're the thing that points to the thing. George earlier pointed out that most NFTs theactual image is not on the blockchain it's somewhere else it's on IPFS for example,and people say it as if this is some type of big gachu and that's because people haven't spentany time thinking how any advanced society works, and every single advanced societyworks primarily by manipulating pointers not underlying objects.I have a big tweet storm about real estate and people say oh you know real estate is a supertangible thing like when you very different than NFTs you own a house you own a piece of land youown an office building. but when you own a piece of land what does it actually mean what it actuallymeans is that the land registry office for your jurisdiction there is a title deed and that titledeed says, plot 123456 is owned by Mike Smith and if Mike Smith wants to sell it to George.They're going to go to the title office and maybe some other places and maybe their lawyers willput some documents together and they'll sign all these documents and the pointers will change hands,nothing is actually going to happen on the land itself right the land is just going to be sitting,there the land doesn't have the slightest idea the land's been there for billions of years rightthat's the slightest idea that there are some overgrown monkeys us who are trading pieces of paperor in modern times entries in a database and saying this land is my land this land, is your landwe've now changed who's landed as the land's just there very much off-chain hanging out but Mike,Smith and George are trading a pointer to the land and when that pointer moves we all collectivelypretend that George owns the land just like we all collectively pretended that previously that Mikeowned the land, this is the part where someone says yeah but the reason that works is society iswilling to enforce it like if George now owns the land and Mike won't get out George can call thepolice and yeah that's just because society, is respecting that social convention it's just asocial convention. It didn't exist at some point at some point hundreds or thousands of years agoit's one of these stories that other if it's actually true, that people say about when the Europeanscame to North American the Native Americans were there they didn't really have this concept of landownership and they thought the Europeans were kind of nuts quite saying like, oh I owned this riverand I owned this mountain, I don't know if it's actually true or if it's one of those thingsyou learn in elementary school, but in any case that is in fact how it is it's just an imaginarysocial convention we have decided, that the way to organize land ownership, is by trading thesepieces of paper well that is exactly what NFTs are. We have decided and today the people who careabout the social convention are maybe a million people, or half a million people or two millionpeople, but that number was going to grow every single year we have decided that a token and ifthat token is in your wallet, it is a pointer to something else and we're going to attributeownership to something else to the person, who has that token. It is also why the right clicksave as argument is so very silly if you're deeply crypto native someone of course can goright click save hug 6529 right now. In fact when I first started tweeting a lot people would do itto me all the time they'd come and say, oh ha ha ha I've right click saved your punk and now I'mgoing to use it okay have fun I mean you can use it but the reality is we all know, that, thecrypto punk token 6529 is in my wallet not in your wallet and if you want a market assessment ofhow strong the social convention is, the market assessment will pay exactly zero dollars foryour downloaded jpeg, but would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for the token that's thesocial convention at work, that's why if you go just stand on someone's land you don't become an odorof it you have to go buy the title deed right you have to go through the social convention.So what does how do I see this where does this fit in,to the history of crypto assets it is all exactly the same idea as when we started withbitcoin. Bitcoin is this concept for money currency you can argue which one of those two it isis some type of commodity one of those things and what we have said in the bitcoin world, is if youown these certain outputs in your wallet you can that means something and the amount ofeye rolling that was happening a decade ago when bitcoin people would say that was giganticthere's no question this mean anything at all why does this matter right now. It has been establishedthat it matters and this doesn't nothing changes of bitcoin's worth two thousand dollars twentythousand dollars two hundred thousand dollars the it's clearly worth something people have clearlysubscribed value and monetary like value to bitcoin then the ERC20 tokens, that george mentionedearlier are more or less the same point but for financial instruments now you say well what doyou mean are they financial instruments are they securities, are they not securities there's a lotof dancing around on this topic because of the us regulations, against secure against unregisteredsecurities, so some ERC20 tokens look very much like financial instruments some go througha variety of convoluted ideas to not look like financial instruments but basically, that's whatthey are right and some of them might be a security under the us definition some of them are not asecurity under the us definition, but what they are aiming to replicate is arbitrary financialinstruments so if bitcoin or maybe ether but you know the popular perception of bitcoin isthe underlying currency well, an ERC20 token is something like a stock, a bond, a derivativesome weird new financial instruments that don't have great analogs in the fiat world, but thingswhose nature is primarily financial and they are fungible and that's how financial instrumentswork, right, that's how financial instruments work in the real world they are all fungible,and they're traded around primarily for financial reasons and if you see how ERC20 tokenswork that's the context of their environment with this in mind we go to ERC-721 switchesor 1155s in any case the nft protocols. This is the same concept for quite literally in my vieweverything else in the world and it's interesting because everything else in the world, is actuallya lot of things in a very big number most things in the world, are non fungible there's a huge amountof value embedded in fungible instruments, in the world a huge and possibly well certainly hundredsof trillions of dollars, but there are even more hundreds of trillions of dollars, embedded innon fungible objects and with that let's go to the next slide.This is my highest level view of what NFTs are, what NFTs can be, and how NFTs can developover the next decade, and the first thing to see here is that split on the top betweennatively digital intangible assets and physical, or tangible assets, where we'remaking an abstract pointer to them. NFTs will first develop in the intangible natively digitalcategory the reason that is is because the blockchain world, the online world, the interoperablewith blockchain world, does not need anything from the regulatory system from the government,from the enforcement mechanisms of the state, in order to make the first part work so, iflike uh i do on occasion we mint a meme card and there's i don't know 420 tokens and we assertthat that meme card each one of those tokens, represents an addition of one out of 420 ofthis piece of art and we the artists the issuer are going to treat them as such. Well that's itbut i don't need any other i don't need any other assistance from the state to do that.I can see where those tokens are i can interact with those tokenspermissionlessly i can say if you have one of these tokens, you can come into this token gatedspace in OM, if a person who does not currently have one of these tokens asks me, how can i buy oneof the additions from this artist? in the meme cards i can just point him to the meme cardscontract and say well buy one of these tokens and then they can buy it on a permissionless exchangei never need to call the courts i never need to call the police i never need to use theenforcement mechanism of the state that is required for physical goods. Because the wonderful thing withcryptocurrency it is much easier to play defense than it is in the real world. In the real world,if i was if there was no state and i had a piece of land and i'm just a normal type of guymaybe someone who has more muscles, or more guns, or more friends, says well i don't care about yoursilly little title, you have i'm moving in and you're moving out and in absence of a statemechanism it's actually quite hard to prevent them you know if you did this with a normaldeveloped state, you're going to call the police and the courts and someone will help get you yourproperty back but in absence, of that you'll probably lose it, with the encryption embedded incrypto assets with the model embedded in crypto assets, playing defense does not require any help,you can just have the token in your wallet, and nobody can take it to you by force at a firstapproximation and yeah there's hacking and things like that but at a first approximation nobodycan take it by force, so what this means is anything that can be digitally, linked to an NFTcan start developing now. The regulatory state the normal,Society is slow on innovation they'll eventually get there but it might take 5 to 10 yearsorder to put an intangible asset like a piece of art on an NFT so in this bucket what do i say,well NFT started with what weren't something like collectibles or things that straddled theline between collectibles and art they have gone very strongly into the art space as wellso collectibles and art are the majority of the market today. What most people expect is goingto come in the next phase, as greater usage in gaming assets, in metaverse assets, buildingslands trees things of that nature. What will come after that is more real world intellectual property,right well intellectual property that might not be directly linked to a visual on an NFT,brand's cultural society all of this type of intangible assets and can come on board now there'sno technical challenge stopping it there's no regulatory framework. That is needed all you needis education onboarding and you might say well okay i mean that stuff sounds small it is notsmall at all intangible assets there is a very large report and in fact George we should add itto the reading and maybe next week, that every year counts the amount of intangible assets oncorporate balance sheets and it's over 75 trillion dollars and that doesn't even capture intangible,assets that are not on balance sheet you know the american flag, the statue of liberty, the land ofthe free, and the home of the brain that's an intangible asset but you're not going to find itwritten down on a financial statement somewhere but it certainly makes the United States morevaluable than if it didn't have this type of branding so we are looking already at aexisting stock of intangibles that's larger than the money supply and there's no obviousbarrier to me for some of that migrating on chain this is kind of bucket one bucket two which is mymission for being at 6529's mission for being we'll cover this in latersessions in more detail. I believe NFTs can be the underlying database for an open metaversebut i don't want to get into that today. That's a longer story we'll pick that up towards theend of the course then at some point we will start migrating non-fungible physical world assets,and services to NFTs, and these are all the examples that people talk about now but nobodydoes, because it's going to take time oh i can buy a house by buying an NFT, i can rent a holiday villaby buying an NFT, for these certain dates i can rent a digital billboard, in Times Square for thesehours, by buying an NFT and what it means once this happens you can move all of these interactionsout of a bunch of fragmented proprietary databases which is where they are now.If you want to book a night at the midtown Hilton, on six avenue you have to call Hiltonwhich nights are available in the Hilton database and these things are going to end upa decade from now in the OpenSea of that which might be open here might be someone else, soi want to go to the Hilton let me see what the floor is for Hilton upper room prices on thesedays on sixth avenue. For these things to happen you'll need some more let's call it enforcementcounterparty regulatory certainty, now you have the token you show up and say hey this house is minesomeone says no it's not. Well we're back to the physical world issues the mechanism bywhich you bought the house has to be recognized by the state so you can say look, Mike you'vegot to leave the house i have the token i can prove to a court that i have the token andyou're going to get evicted so i see these coming closer to the end of the decade.Both will happen and when both happen you're discussing an addressable market of severalhundred trillion dollars but the natively visual ones will happen first. Let's go to the next slide.I think this one straightforward i put it here in case anyone,you know, if it was helpful after the prior slides but this is in fact the kind of twoby two matrix that fits here there are things that are tangible and intangible right so commoditiesoil, wheat, etc is tangible and fungible a bushel of wheat is a bushel of wheat at a first approximationthere are things that are tangible and non fungible my house is different than your house mypainting on my wall is different than your painting on your wall there might be things,that are semi fungible, right? My Nike sneakers are different than a lot of Nike sneakers butsimilar to some Nike sneakers and well, it's a joke but, it's not a joke i mean us right all of usare tangible non fungible objects towards, is different than me and we're very much tangibleand then on the intangible side the intangible fungibles are the ones who said before moneyand financial instruments. These are these are where we see the l1 the the tokens of the majorblockchains and the ERC20 tokens or their equivalent that right above them, and thentangibles and non fungible intangible non fungibles are culture society, a lot of services areintangible digital goods, obviously like the ones we've been describing a lot of intellectualproperty and so, fungible tokens will work on the first row, here non fungible tokens will work on.The second row short of public blockchains, public cryptocurrencies getting banned by the regulatorswhich spending a lot of time and effort, to make sure that does not happen all of this is goingto happen over the course of decade and all, of it is going to be actively good for societythere's no reason they'll be actively good for society, in the same way that the internet wasbetter than filing cabinets, or a bunch of independent content management systems werethe internet gave you a unified platform, a single standards-based interoperable way totransmit information. Crypto assets give us a uniform interoperable public commonsto trade things of value, whether they're fungible or non fungible. So let me see which is the nextslide is. One more high-level model and people who follow me on twitter hear me talking all the timeabout memes and how we need to seize the memes or how the memes are the most important thing in theworld and i think, some people think i'm joking but i'm actually not joking at allthere's a great book called Sapiens by Yuval Harari which talks about myth how society works withmyths or stories if you prefer or if you prefer, if you're a sociologist inter subjectiverealities and objective things are things like the computer i'm speaking to and the microphone,i'm speaking to objectively they're here subjective things, are kind of non-tangiblethings that i feel, right, i feel happy right now, i'm telling you that i feel happy but, i, you knowthere's really no way for you to see it or feel it inter subjective things are imaginary things.We believe together so imaginary things, we believe together, are that the Nike is a good brandbut just do it makes us feel happy but just do it makes you want to buy a pair of shoes for moremoney than you would have otherwise, but wearing shoes with a swoosh on them, might make you morelikely to jump higher or further or faster, so these inter subjective myths,are basically not different from the memes. They're basically not and you can say okay wellthat's fine but that's not the important stuff the important stuff is trucks and guns and oil and,and physical resources and cash flows and investment bankers and i disagree.All of those things are downstream from memes and myths.Nike has a lot of revenue and a lot of factories and a lot of distributionbut the reason it has all these things is because people believe in the solution just do it and thegeneral brand that has been built, and if that brand didn't exist, those would be less important andless successful. It's easy to see at a national level people are willing tounfortunately die, for national memes and myths and that might be good it might be bad it might bebad it might be noble it might not be but it's clearly the case that people are going to know.If you're very good medically if you're Obama and you say yes we can and you repeat it thousands oftimes, or if you're Donald Trump and you say make America great again and you repeat it thousandsof times, and your meme your myth, that yes we can all do it together with solidarity orthat America's on the decline but if we change how we operate it will be ascendant again. Theseare intersubjective myths their memes right that red hat make America red hats a meme.If you're very good at memes the population of the united states will reward you by makingyou the most powerful person in the world who can direct trillions of dollars of economic resources,and give you the power to end human life on earth.Armies are an important tangible thing they're not a meme, but who gives instructionsto the army is the person who's good at memes, that's how you get elected and i think in the lastbecause you write very good policy papers, that should be over now right thoughwell you get elected is by getting people to feel a certain way to organize a certain way to believein a common reality a common intersubjective reality a myth a meme, and then human behaviororganizes downstream from that. Long-winded way of saying nfts can be very important socially as well,because they give us direct access, to the underlying memei don't think this has even played out one percent what am i about to say.If you are Nike and you are now the holder of a powerful mythyou have to go through an extremely complicated set of activities designing shoes hiring athleteswho are putting them on tv, running factories in Vietnam, shipping shoes across the ocean,shipping shoes across the country, having retail employees sell them to you accountants lawyerstaxes money and bank accounts financial statements shareholder resolutions and you pay a dividendat the end you monetize that with a vastly complicated set of activities you take thememe that is intangible you make it tangible through a huge amount of human effort and billions ofdollars of dividends got there. Here we can short circuit here we can hold the intellectual propertydirectly the meme directly i say well why does it matter what can you do with it i think we'refiguring that out i don't think it's actually this is not something where i can say on the nextfive slides i'm going to tell you what you can do when you see the meme no we're figuring that partout along the way. I believe this gives us the opportunity to change society for the betterthat when people say well i'm not happy with this societal system or i'm not happy with thatsocietal system well societies are just made out of people right voters are just the people,you go to work with or go for drinks with, or hang out with, or i don't know go to sports games withthose are those are the fellow voters everyone believes in memes, everyone believes in mythsand when you change a medium you know the medium is the message every time there's a shift in medium,there's an opportunity for new messages to emerge and perhaps we have an opportunity formore pro-social messages to emerge for messages, that are more decentralized in nature that a societythat gives more trust to people and spreads power more diffuser. I think there is that levelof opportunity it's not easy the opposite could also happen right NFTs are politically neutral.Someone could use them to very effectively promote memes that are against perhaps the valuesthe crypto community believes in so they're politically neutral like every other technologybut, i think we will see a different way of organizing human activity just like tv organizedhuman activity in a different way right tv was, a centralized force in American culture all of asudden once broad network tv crossed across the country at the same time at the same hour acrossthe gigantic country all people could watch the same show or listen to the same news anchor andthat formed a form of certain social construction. Now we have the ability to form social constructionin the natively digital environment that we live in and without the centralization thathas happened with social media companies but it's not a sure thing this part's not a sure thingthis part we have to work for. This part we have to figure out how to do it but i have avery very gut sense that it is possible, i think this is it on my high concept slides andhopefully this was comprehensible. Can we see the next slide please.I'm going to run through the rest of these slides quickly because i think for some of youthese are over basic and in any case we're going to cover this in much more detail in future sessionsearly nft collections did have a collectible slash gaming flavor and you know now there's a bigdebate you know our punk's art or the collectibles or Pepe's art and the collectibles they certainlyhave some collectible type characteristics right even if they're art they certainly havecollectible type characteristics and this is where the space started. Next slide please.PFPs are by far the largest market category today we'll talk about that in a couple weeks. Next slide.Of the more art oriented nfts generative art has found its natural medium on chainwe'll have a whole session on generative art it's probably my favorite area ofNFTs and i'm very much looking forward to that we have some of the greatestgenerative artists in the world joining us, to talk about generative art. Next slide.One-of-one art is really interesting it's such a token-based term right it's because,a lot of other tokens are not one-of-one but one-of-one art in the world at large, is just calledart by a painting, not, an addition but one-of-one art is not one type of thing. It's many types ofthings again we have some great artists joining there. We'll talk about that in five weeks i think.Next slide. Gaming NFTs, metaverse oriented NFTs,this is not to say that we don't have these now we do but these are areas where people believethat, there's going to be tremendous growth and there's going to be tremendous growth inthe coming years if you notice venture capital firms like entrees and Horowitz are fundingan endless number of gaming studios to build blockchain centric gaming companies. So i suspectwe'll see a lot of development over the next few years here and learn a lot more than we know today.Next slide. Utility-based NFTs are also an area that has not just a ton of potential butalmost completely unexplored the most famous one is BNS, the ethereum name service whereit is in some ways one of the most successful NFTs collections the domains are NFTsand it is a blockchain based domain service where the domain itself is an nft it's fabulouslysmart it's super successful. But you know the mint pass that you will use to attend this coursethat's also utility-based nft there's a nice piece of art associated with it but the primary use ofit is to be able to enter the core spaces to be able to mint your certificate, at the end,there's a lot of potential utility-based nfts that we mostly have not yet fully explored. Next.This is the back end of my prior chart when we start representing real world objects on chain,as i said for big important objects like real estate, we need, regulatory bridges or some typeof enforcement bridges for people to feel comfortable what you're saying now is superinteresting experimentation this is a project by G-money where you mint an NFT, that NFT representsapparently an extremely fancy t-shirt i understand you can actually take possession of yourt-shirt or they can store it for you i don't i haven't dug into it in detail but we're at thebeginning of representation of visual objects as NFTs and it's logically going to start withless expensive items like 300 dollar t-shirts or expensive t-shirts but they are not actuallyhighly expensive items in the house and as we learn more we'll move up the value chain intomore and more expensive objects. But this area has been truly almost completely unexploredit's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out. Next slide. All of those aretopics we are going to cover in the coming weeks. I want to talk just for a couple of minutes onmarket structure, to give a sense of where we are in overall size area of development what have you.The point that out this is in no way a comprehensive list of exchanges, there are many more exchanges,but to me the most interesting thing about exchanges,is in the NFT space, is that almost all of them operate on chain,which means you have data that you just didn't havewith traditional centralized exchangesand traditional centralized exchanges report some data they might have an API they mightthey might share some stats and figures but they're not showing you every trade.That's in their own matching engine or whether it's open seer super rare looks rare,you can just go on the theorem blockchain and see every trade. It's a level of transparencythat i don't think we've ever seen in markets and so this allows for a lot of data collectionto minimum but it also allows i think for a more interesting and competitive environmentlooks rare, when it launched in a form of what is known as a vampire attack on open sea it basicallydropped tokens on the large customers of open sea in the hope that this wouldincent them to move their business looks rare.Well you can't actually do that in the centralized one right like.Binance can't call up Coinbase and say hey brian i'd really appreciate it if you'd send me yourcustomer list and in fact not just your customer list and their contact information but their bankaccounts and also if you could be so kind as to rank all your customers in order profitability,because i really want to go after your profitable customers and take them from you.it'd be very much appreciated just just email it over me to hear CZ at binance.com rightthat's how it works this is like the most closely guarded data at one of these companies and in theNFT world it's all out there in the open not only it's not closely guarded it is literally notguarded at all it's on a public blockchain and once you've seen this, it actually feels strange togo back and if you're truly a believer in free markets, if our regulatory system could get past,its one-sided view of crypto we'll talk about that later, and think about what this can mean forcapitalism for consumer surplus for, actual free markets, it's very good for consumers there's areason that transaction fees are low and dropping in these marketplaces they'll continue to drop,because you can compete and you can compete in a way that you know nobody can compete with the Appleapp store for apple devices so i think it's interesting that we'll have a pretty open andtransparent view of the trading in this space. Let's go to the next chart. So this is a chart thatcomes from a team at the University of Nicosia called nftvaluations.com i'm an advisor to theteam a bunch of other six-five to nine people advise the team they're trying to build up marketcaps of various collections token by token and the market cap in a fungible collection is easierright you just take the number of bitcoins you take the last trades you multiply those twotogether as you know that the market cap of bitcoin is 385 billion dollars, or whatever it isthe market cap of the crypto punks is hard because sometimes some are alien, some are zombies, someare humans, some have hoodies, some have mohawks, some have the dreaded spotty face, i mean what you needto do is calculate the value of each one and then add it up and it's hard and on any givenand on any given token you might be wrong, but i've seen the data that underlies this,it's certainly more than good enough for the purposes of this chart right any particular tokenmight be wrong but in aggregate i think the mistakes cancel out, and what it says that forpfps and generative art and this data does not include one-of-one art yet, it does not includemetaverse land, except, i think the other side land is in there um it does not include utilitybased which mostly don't exist except for ens and it does not include gaming, but it does havemost of the major PFP and generative art collections the overall market cap is around 10 billiondollars today at peak happiness in the crypto markets, it was around 30 billion dollars.This matches my sense and so it's 10 billion, maybe with the other sectors in it's 15 billionsomething like that. What is my takeaway from this the space is still absolutely tiny, tiny,fungible tokens are we're flirting with a trillion dollars recently, in the peak they went almostat 3 trillion, i say this all the time to everyone i can find the only thing i'm a hundredpercent sure, of is the current ratio of fungible token market cap and non fungible token marketcap, which is today about about a hundred to one that ratio is wrong i think that ratio is goingto get closer every year i think one year they eventually they're going to be more or less thesame. That might take a decade but they're going to be more or less the same and they're probablygoing to be more or less the same at a higher number than we are today. Now.I got pretty active in the bitcoin world in summer 2013 and in those days the market cap of bitcoinwould you know go to 5 billion dollars and maybe all of the other altcoins, maybe you'd get to 10billion i don't remember the details but it's in that range and this is what it actually feels tome this is what the maturity of the space feels to me like, it feels like 2013 era bitcoin it'sabout that size it's still a fairly close community, i tell people sometimes enjoy this is the timewhere if you're really active in the space you can sort of kind of feel like you know everyoneyou might not know them individually, but you know of them that's going to change, it's going to changefairly soon and it's going to change, because the space is going to get bigger and it's a good thingthe space will get bigger it's a healthy thing but fairly soon you there'll be hundreds of thingsgoing on all over the world in all types of sectors and sub sectors of NFTs and you'll have no ideaabout them because you'll be focused on, you know generative art in south America or somethingbut so i think the important takeaway it's still very early it means the space is also going tobe hugely volatile, all crypto assets are volatile bitcoins the least volatile theorems a little bitmore volatile the altcoins are more volatile than a theorem. NFTs are more volatile than all of themand that has to do with their level of maturity which is not very mature and by the way i justwant to be clear and i reiterate George's not financial advice from the beginning.Just because the NFT space today is 10 billion dollars and i think one day it's going to beYour specific NFT might go to zero and that market cap could be in a new NFT collectionNFTs do not have the same network effects that bitcoins right with bitcoin most of the value ofthe money currency commodity store value usage case, coalesced in one token that's definitelynot going to happen in the NFTs space. NFTs represent a wide range of things we've beendiscussing so there's going to be a broad set of NFT tokens and collections that are carrying thismarket cap. The vast majority of them not yet invented so certain of course NFTs will do wellover time, but, my perspective is not that the average NFT will do well over time economicallyin fact my perspective is actually close to the opposite the average NFT will not do well overtime some of them will but most of them won't but what is absolutely the case is that NFTsas a category will do better and better and better every year, you know subject to the normalmacroeconomic and crypto market cycles. Let's go to the next page.So these are the two different ways, that they calculate market cap anyway there for thesepurposes the same the interest is the thing, i would point out is among the two categoriesPFPs and generative art most of the market caps and PFPs and it'll be very interesting.if anyone can come up with a reasonable estimate for the value of one of one art,that's a very difficult problem because it basically never trades so we'll see what that looks like,but i'll be surprised if it's more than generative art right now i guess it's in the same range soit does mean that even though a lot of people say like oh i don't know about PFPs maybe they're notgreat, most of the market cap the market in aggregate values PFPs more than anything else.That might be wrong we'll see but it's what the case is today an interesting sub point a lot ofthat market cap is in the Yuga collections or Dapes, Apes, punks we have one of the co-foundersof Yuga coming in a couple weeks we're going to discuss that and if that's healthy not healthywhat it means how that space evolves but today the things you should take away is the space ismost of it in fact Yuga Labs manage PFPs so let's go to the next bench.Let's go to conclusions.Okay. Very, very high level uh summary and i think we cover this in more detail butNFTs are unique, enumerated contracts that can live on smart contract blockchainsthey will certainly there's already, certainly representing a lot of intangible objects andrepresent a lot more intangible objects and in time tangible objects the potential addressablemarket is gigantic but the current NFT market is tiny, so many exciting things have happened but itis still super immature super experimental many things are going to fail there are many new things,that we're going to invent along the way that have not been invented and so we're at the beginning,of the beginning, we'll have several cycles of up down and new inventions along the way over thenext, you know, over the next decade. Let's see the next slide.We have put a little bit of extra greeting for those a little bit more technical you knowor you can go see some of these standards of, how an NFT token is designed what are the designstandards if you're not technical i think you're going to find the first four licks borderlineincomprehensible and i wouldn't worry about it you know if you're more technical and you'll wantto see the protocols it could be interesting. A lot of these big picture ideas i tweet a lotand tweet storms and that's the link to all the tweet storms but we're working on trying to getthem in a format that people can read easier, so at some point during the course we'll havethat and i'll share it and some of these topics you know real estate and memes and what have youare covered well in the tweet storms and so, we'll make that available and then the data we just sawon market cap came out of a report that the NFT valuations teams does have recorder,it's online, there's a link there they they have not learned to make it an NFT yet we should harassthem to make it an NFT, but right now it looks like it's just a pdf on their server but thereare some interesting facts and figures there to look at. Okay. I think these are our officialslides i think incredibly George is going to come back here and what we're going to do isanswer some questions and hopefully, the because, hopefully the team has been pulling togetherquestions while we chat and maybe we can spend George, on 15 20 minutes answering questionssomething with them I think first of all thank you very much for this this was as always hugelyenlightening. We are at the beginning of the beginning this is this is what what what I've keptand I think we're gonna be coming back to this thing later on. So first of all the team has beenactive in in the chat and they have been responding to people's questionsand covered many of them uh there are a couple of questions i can i could relate them to you.One is - What are your thoughts about Manifold launching a gallery-themed marketplace yesterday?Well first of all I would say, I think Manifold is great I think they have done,the best work of anyone in terms of helping the community realize, it is doable manageable andwith the help of their tools easy enough, to get to launch on your own contract. I've usedmanifold contracts for several things I found their tools helpful so I think Manifold's greati saw their announcement that they're going to make a marketplace.I think it's a logical move for them i think it is also,always a challenging business model. Marketplaces are very successful when they're successfuland tough to break into when you're new. Right? So right now right now mostover the volume by far is on Opensea and that makes open sea an extraordinarily valuablemarketplace and there are endless teams, coming from different angles, to try and take some ofthat market share and some of them have taken some market share. But the competitive dynamics ofwho gets to be which win which part of the marketplace market share is probably thesingle most competitive thing in NFTs right because it's the single most valuable prize.If you can win it so i understand why they're doing it and i wish them luck because i thinkthey're you know they're very good operators in the space they're promoting the right values butit's also not a sure thing because breaking the liquidity of another marketplace is hard.Okay thank you. There's another question that i think i can take it's uh it's technical aboutthe course. When will the airdrop occur? I guess the question is about the airdrop of the materialfor week one the answer is that we have already started airdropping course material the firstfor the delay has been that we basically broke the limit anything about the 19 000 airdropsneeded a special handling from us so we're doing it in batches so those of you thathave minted the course NFT you should expect this presentation dropping to your wallet in the nextcouple of hours and then we're gonna be having multiple airdrops for the videos and everythingelse in the course please monitor our discord and twitter you see both in the slide here becausewe're gonna be announcing every time we're doing a an airdrop next question is actually veryinteresting. Is there a pull-up proof of attendance protocol to admit. I mean i think the answer is no right now right but it's a very good idea but it's a good ideait's a very good idea and so, um and so, thewe should do it for some event yeah yeah let's make a note let's make a note for that andget back to it it's a very good idea i think and some of the things that we are doingespecially with our guests might, it might be a good thing for people to to have a proofof attendance on these events and i think as we roll out the campus over the next few weeks,this is going to become more more pertinent. I can actually see the question chance myself sooh nice. The Amazon web service is responsible for storing all of our NFTs well idon't know who our NFTs are but certainly not the ones for this course right the ones for thesecourse are on Arwave i believe correct so no no we are we're all about decentralizationand setting best practices so we will not be putting your NFTs on Amazon web services.Another similar technical question people asked. Why did we make the mint passes?As ERC 720 ones not 1155s and the answer is so we can track individuals right like so people cansay this is the one that i got here and i did this over time when an 1155 doesn't 1155, isnon fungible within is fungible within the context of a specific token right so if we want to saya student 1234, did these 18 things over the course of the semesterwe need a ERC 721 to do that george is that correct sir accurate yes yes i think it's a it's an accuratedescription. There's a similar question that says: If i transfer my course NFT to anotherwallet where the airdrops come to the new wallet? The answer is they should we as i've said in thebeginning we are we're experimenting there we've done our tests at limited scale today if i'm notmistaken we have had up to 3000 people joining us live we have more than 20000 wallets connectedand minting the course access token so what we're doing is we are we're querying thecontract and we're looking at transfers, so we should be able to airdrop the, the, nfts to thecurrent holder of the token this means that if you have minted your course access nft and thenyou transferred it to another wallet, all future airdrops will happen to the new wallet however,if there have been airdrops to the previous one obviously these are not going to be automaticallytransferred you would have to either leave them in the old wallet or manually transfer them there.I don't see why the team couldn't snapshot the new wallets for airdrops allow lists things likethat so i think we'll be okay. Oh here's a very good question: Are you going to issue soulbound NFTs for students who havecompleted the course? Very good it's a very good question. We have our initial view but we're goingto think about it over the course of the semester and give a final answer at the end of the semesterbut my general view, is no we will not make them soulbound. Because my general view is let's sayyou want to hold this uh certificate for the next 40 years of your life there's zero chance you willnot change wallets during that period in fact you will probably change wallets many many manytimes during that period and if you want so either that means you're going to be stuckmaintaining an old wallet for the rest of your life just to hold a course nft or the Universityof Nicosia is going to have to provide customer support for the rest of your life, where they'llhave to verify that you are now that new person in another wallet to transfer which seems quitedifficult. So we um we think they will not be soulbound but probably once we get to the lastfew weeks of the course we'll come out with our logic on that and how specifically we think aboutdoing that. Fair George yeah i think it's fair i as you said i too haven't made up my mind 100%about the applicability of soulbound tokens for for university degrees andcertificates but given that long term there's as you said zero chance that people will not bemigrating to new wallets and so on and so forth i think the default option should be that thesethings should be transferable. Now we need to figure out how we can make them transferable butnot sellable because obviously we don't want people to go in a marketplace and selltheir their degree to others uh that's that's that's totally an open question, we have somethoughts on that too but i think we should start with with a non soulbound token and youknow be convinced otherwise. Next question. Are you scared of big brand style of centralizationor should we embrace because there's truly room for both? So the answer that question is yes and yesi had many arguments discussions healthy debate vigorous debate on Twitter about this topic whenbig brands issued NFTs right and a lot of people said well we don't like it that Adidas did annft draw we want to be here for the independent artists right and i'll answer the second questionfirst first of all it's a permissionless network anyone just like an independent artist canissue an NFT Adidas can issue an NFT and they don't have to ask our permission to do so rightand if a lot of people went and spend a lot of money on the Adidas NFT and it suggests that peoplewant the Adidas NFT right if everyone really didn't want the Adidas NFT it wouldn't have been to them.Right? It can't be like it's very very bad a lot of people bought it if a lot of people bought ita lot of people wanted but to me and my things that i care about which is ensuring that ourdigital world in the future, the metaverse is decentralized well if Adidas doesn't issue an NFTit's not like the alternative is Adidas will not participate in the digital economy Adidaswill participate in the digital economy anyway and they will issue some type of digital collectibleon Facebook and the same people who like Adidas and buy Adidas shoes will buy the digital collectibleon Facebook and Adidas will earn the same amount of money from doing this and promote centralization.Whereas if Adidas issues on an nft instead Adidas and its market power is promoting decentralizationso between the two there's no actual option to say Adidas should stop earning revenue and peopleshould stop spending money on adidas right they will this is going to happen and so if that'sthe case do we want them on our decentralized quote unquote rails or do we want them on someoneelse's centralized rails i prefer that they come with us. Now does this create a risk that people mightor big brands might successfully centralize the space? Yes, for sure the big brands are excellentmeme makers they're excellent myth makers they have millions of customers they have years ofmarketing people like them and so there is a window now, where new crypto native communities brandsideas can emerge but that window won't be open forever right eventually the big brands are goingto come and they are going to be successful and we have to in the meantime stand up some of our ownbrands some of our own communities some of our own ethos, to be able to hold their own with themit's also why i sometimes laugh when you know people think that certain artists andcertain artists, are minting too much or becoming too big. None of this is true.Everything in the NFT space all together is still a rounding error versus the big brands bigsociety centralized society and so forth, this if we want to be successful in the world of largewe have to get bigger all of the big nft native brands need to get bigger so that when we're 15years talking about Disney and Nike and Adidas and apple we're also talking about 10 otherbrands that got built in this era and that have decentralization as their underlying ethosotherwise all that's going to happen is only the big brands will go away there's no versionwhere we can only stay small i don't i don't think that actually happensOkay. I think there's a related question regarding to regarding big brands, whetherthey will be in the path of decentralization the future so for example if you see Facebookor twitter become decentralized in a few years from now, what are your thoughts on this.Well is that the question about tech companies being decentralized or is it about brands beingdecentralized so i think well the first part of the question is about brands and then the examplethat the student offers is about Facebook and Twitter but i think we can take both.Okay one second. So let's take brands first because this isa very interesting topic the i think of something like Nouns right. Nouns is trying to builda very decentralized brand right they are they have their Nouns glasses and they're of course tokenbased and the actual imagery is CC0 public domain imagery and so anyone can use their brandimagery and punk 4156 who's one of the founders there is going to come on the course later inthe semester to talk about this and i think his view is that network brands that take advantageof tokens and social media and public domain IP will actually emerge and be able to compete withbig brands, because they'll use the power of networks it's a very interesting question it's a veryinteresting experiment nobody has nobody knows how it's going to play out, but i very much look forwardto seeing it now to another question you know will we have decentralized social media in effect.I think the answer is yes. I've also thought that for many years and i think it's less likely thatit's because Twitter will become decentralized on the blockchain or have you in fact Elon Muskyesterday said specifically that he does not want to do that he does not think the scalability isthere, to run a Twitter like service on blockchain whether he's right or wrong that's what he believessounds to me that Elon wants to build the western We-chat uh but i do think some version will emergebut it's like the it's like the marketplace question. Twitter has gigantic network effects.Facebook has gigantic network effects what is the thing that is interesting enoughto pull people away and my guess is with always these things it's not going to be Twitter 2.0and there's a lot of people trying to make Twitter 2.0 trying to make twitter but decentralizedand i wish them the best and i hope it works but my gut sense is people get disrupted not by justthe exact same version of what they are but decentralized they get disrupted by somethingthat they don't think is a competitor at first they look at something say okay this is not acompetitor i think the thing that will disrupt Twitter is something that when twitter sees iton day one and year one i was saying this is not a competitor to me at all i don't have to worry aboutand it's going to come from a completely different angle that architecture will be decentralizedand then one day it will be taking market share from Twitter in the same way that Twitter todaytakes market share from the new york times and at some point you know 15 years ago if you told thenew york times you are going to lose market share and brand share and setting the agenda for theworld share to Twitter it would be a laughable proposition and yet it happened and so i thinkit won't happen but probably not in a direct clone but i wish the direct clones luck and maybehopefully some of them will work i've supported some of them a direct clone would also be helpfuland but i think it's going to look a little different.Okay. We are we're closing to two hours i know we've said that its live session would be one hourlong but I guess this one was would have to be longer anyway because we needed to cover thecourse logistics as well. I think we've covered most of the questions that were related to thisweek's material i see a number of questions in the chat but they are related to stuff that we willcover in the future we have another 11 weeks ahead of us so let's not cover everything today.I guess we could wrap it up at this point 6529 any final parting thoughtsbecause before i give people a few practical pointers to the future. No, i think it's greatlook we have i don't know 30 40 50 sessions in bound so we'll have plenty of time to cover a lotof topics if you are not following the UNIC metaverse Twitter account and discord please do.For now this is probably the only centralized part in the infrastructure and we're trying to thinkabout how to eliminate that as well but for the next few weeks i think that is real it's a realthing and so do follow it and there are going to be ongoing developments every few days so keep an eyethere so you you know you know what's going to happen. Absolutely we're going to be using bothtwitter and discord to announce things almost on a daily basis because we're we're buildingaround the clock so as 6529 said please follow us on twitter and make sure that youkeep an eye on discord especially in the announcements uh discord is our primarycourse support channel as well uh you can email us at metaverse@unic.ac.cyalthough I would uh say that discord will probably result in a faster resolutionof whatever issue you have. I would like to remind everyone that the next live session for weektwo which uh is going to be about copyright and provenance will take place on Wednesdayso that's October the 12th same time 5pm eastern European standard time Cyprus time solooking forward to seeing everyone then uh in the meantime uh have fun and uh keep an eye on yourwallets because we're going to be air dropping uh lots of things uh to your wallets in the comingdays bye bye everyone bye bye bye
