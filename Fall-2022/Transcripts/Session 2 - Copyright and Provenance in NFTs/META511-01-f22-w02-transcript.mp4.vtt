00:29.100 --> 00:29.620
 Hello, hello.

00:29.620 --> 00:36.820
 Hello, hi everyone. Welcome to the second live session of the NFTs and the Metaverse

00:36.820 --> 00:45.060
 course offered by the University of Nicosia in partnership with Punk 6529 and the OM.

00:45.060 --> 00:52.140
 I'm George Giaglis and before introducing our topic and our lecturers for today, I'd like

00:52.140 --> 00:58.980
 to take a couple of minutes to remind everyone of a few things related to the course logistics.

00:58.980 --> 01:05.540
 First of all, as you all know, we are building the OM's Metacampus, so we should soon be

01:05.540 --> 01:12.460
 able to migrate most of our future educational activities there. You should be able to see

01:12.460 --> 01:17.620
 the Metacampus building site on your right as you look at this screen, so hopefully that

01:17.620 --> 01:24.100
 direction. After we finish today's session, I encourage everyone to make the short journey

01:24.100 --> 01:30.100
 to the portal to the Metacampus and visit it. You will just be able to see our first construction

01:30.100 --> 01:36.860
 there, which is an open amphitheater, where we will probably be meeting for next week's

01:36.860 --> 01:43.140
 live session, but over the coming weeks we will be rolling out other places in the campus

01:43.140 --> 01:49.940
 as well. So that's number one. Number two, please remember that this is a non-chain course,

01:49.940 --> 01:56.980
 so we will be trying to touch upon centralized systems as little as possible. To this end,

01:56.980 --> 02:02.580
 most of the educational material for the course will be made accessible to you in the form

02:02.580 --> 02:13.540
 of NFTs. Those of you who had minted the course access token by last Friday should have already

02:13.540 --> 02:21.260
 received in your course wallet another NFT, this time an ERC 1155 token. Remember the

02:21.260 --> 02:27.940
 the discussion we had last week about standards. This token contains all the slides from last

02:27.940 --> 02:34.780
 week's presentation. You should be able to view this NFT on marketplaces like OpenSea

02:34.780 --> 02:42.500
 or LuxRare, although you may need to try different browsers and settings to get it to work properly

02:42.500 --> 02:51.540
 for you. For me, the best experience has been to view it in OpenSea using Firefox as a browser,

02:51.540 --> 02:57.980
 as Chrome seems to be blocking its content by default, at least on my Mac. We're working

02:57.980 --> 03:04.380
 to make future drops easier to interact with, so if you have any ideas or comments about

03:04.380 --> 03:12.100
 that, as always, please drop us a note on Discord or Twitter or in the chat here. Number

03:12.100 --> 03:20.220
 three, please note that all material regarding the course will be made available on our GitHub

03:20.220 --> 03:26.060
 account, including our live sessions. The live sessions will also be available on YouTube

03:26.060 --> 03:32.620
 for those of you that cannot make the live session. Always monitor our Twitter account,

03:32.620 --> 03:39.500
 this is the unique Metaverse account, for details on how to access this material on more

03:39.500 --> 03:46.380
 centralized, let's say, service providers. Number four, don't forget that you can use

03:46.380 --> 03:52.460
 the OM chat here to ask any questions you want to the lecturers that relate to today's session.

03:52.460 --> 03:59.660
 Starting today, we will also be taking questions from Twitter. Just make sure that you either use

03:59.660 --> 04:07.700
 the NFT Q&A hashtag when posting your question and or mention the unique Metaverse account so

04:07.700 --> 04:14.940
 that we can pick the question and feed it to the lecturers. The final thing, please note that in order

04:14.940 --> 04:20.060
 to manage the load on OM, we are splitting the class into rooms. Each room will have a maximum

04:20.060 --> 04:27.020
 the capacity of 500 people. So please note that if you leave and reenter the OM during the live

04:27.020 --> 04:33.140
 session, you might find yourself in a different room with different classmates, different chat

04:33.140 --> 04:40.020
 history, etc. There's nothing to do on your side. I'm just noting this so that you're not confused

04:40.020 --> 04:47.980
 if you find yourself in another classroom suddenly. Also, please note that if you remain inactive for a

04:47.980 --> 04:53.260
 period of time, your avatar doesn't move, you don't do anything in the chat or anything, OM will

04:53.260 --> 04:59.980
 automatically lock you out of multiplayer mode and you will find yourself alone in the Metaverse

04:59.980 --> 05:06.460
 world. So in that case, simply reload the page and reenter in multiplayer to find your classmates

05:06.460 --> 05:15.940
 again. Okay, now on to today's lecture. Today's session is about a very important, I would dare

05:15.940 --> 05:25.060
 say the fundamental aspect of NFTs and this is copyright, trademarks and licensing. Punk 6529

05:25.060 --> 05:32.820
 hinted at the importance of this last week, but today we're going to do a deep dive in the subject

05:32.820 --> 05:39.740
 and explore its different dimensions. As the topic is highly specialized, this week I'm going to be

05:39.740 --> 05:47.500
 taking a backstage role and I'm going to leave the floor to experts. So today's session will be a

05:47.500 --> 05:55.660
 presentation and a live discussion between 6529 and our first guest in this course. So it is a

05:55.660 --> 06:04.180
 pleasure and an honor to present to you Ms. Eliana Torres. Let me read this so that I don't make

06:04.180 --> 06:11.700
 any mistake. Eliana is an attorney in the intellectual property group at Nixon Peabody LLP,

06:11.700 --> 06:18.540
 where she's part of Nixon's blockchain Metaverse and IP teams. She focuses her practice on

06:18.540 --> 06:24.580
 technology transactions, copyrights and trademarks, but she's also an avid collector of NFTs,

06:24.580 --> 06:32.540
 where she has witnessed the many issues involving IP around them. Prior to joining Nixon,

06:32.540 --> 06:38.180
 Eliana practiced as a trademark attorney for the United States Patent and Trademark Office,

06:38.180 --> 06:45.900
 so I cannot think of a better person to discuss issues related to copyright in NFTs with 6529

06:45.900 --> 06:53.740
 than Eliana. Before giving the floor to her, I would like to give the floor very briefly to

06:53.740 --> 07:02.220
 6529 to introduce today's session and then I'm going to leave him and Eliana to drive the discussion.

07:02.220 --> 07:10.820
 So the floor is yours. Thank you George and thank you everyone and great to be back here. I just

07:10.820 --> 07:17.180
 wanted to note the following. I think copyright and trademark issues are among the most misunderstood

07:17.180 --> 07:25.340
 issues in NFTs, so I think this session is very important from a fundamental basis. I also think

07:25.340 --> 07:32.860
 it is important to understand that Eliana is a lawyer, but at the end of the session you will

07:32.860 --> 07:39.660
 not be a lawyer, so this one session will not substitute for many years of law school and

07:39.660 --> 07:46.900
 practicing as a lawyer, so if you are someone who is active in the space, perhaps as a creator or

07:46.900 --> 07:55.300
 a licensee or you're planning something significant to do with IP in the space, regardless of what

07:55.300 --> 08:01.900
 we cover today, you should hire a relevant lawyer with relevant expertise to help you with whatever

08:01.900 --> 08:09.220
 you're going to do. I am not a lawyer, I am a civilian on this topic. I think I know much more

08:09.220 --> 08:14.860
 than most civilians and yet if I had a complicated issue of this type, I would also hire a lawyer.

08:14.860 --> 08:22.900
 So what I hope we can accomplish today is Eliana will cover some of the basics in the first half

08:22.900 --> 08:29.140
 of the session, and then she and I will have a discussion on some of the more juicy spicy issues

08:29.140 --> 08:35.780
 that exist right now in NFTs, and then we'll do the normal Q&A at then, so with that I'll hand it

08:35.780 --> 08:45.540
 over to Eliana. First of all I want to say thank you for allowing me to be here to 0.6529 for George,

08:45.540 --> 08:52.620
 everyone else that has helped made this happen, it's a historical moment for all of us, and with that

08:52.620 --> 08:59.220
 said I think we could get started with our lecture for today, and I think it's important for us to

08:59.220 --> 09:08.540
 start with some basics, so if we could get our agenda for today on the next slide please. So this

09:08.540 --> 09:16.260
 is where we are, this is our session two, and we'll have an agenda in the next slide. So we'll go

09:16.260 --> 09:21.900
 over intellectual property, trademarks, copyrights, the transfer of copyrights, NFT licenses, and then

09:21.900 --> 09:27.020
 we'll have the Q&A and conclusions with some further reading and some assignments for you guys.

09:27.020 --> 09:36.540
 So starting with intellectual property, which is the next slide, well we already gave this

09:36.540 --> 09:44.780
 claimer, so let's make sure that we all remember that, and there we go. So intellectual property,

09:44.780 --> 09:50.260
 so I thought it would be useful for us to start with just the basics of what intellectual property

09:50.260 --> 09:56.220
 is, and what it encompasses, and the major areas of law that touches on NFTs. So if we have the

09:56.220 --> 10:00.780
 next slide we'll have a breakdown of the major, the trifecta of intellectual property laws and

10:00.780 --> 10:07.820
 intellectual property in the U.S., so we have the intellectual property definition, which is

10:07.820 --> 10:13.740
 basically you have creations of the mind, such as inventions, literary, artistic works, designs,

10:13.740 --> 10:21.540
 symbols, names, and images using commerce, and they break down into three major areas. Patent for

10:21.540 --> 10:25.020
 the most part is not going to be as relevant today, so I'll leave it aside for the moment, but

10:25.020 --> 10:30.060
 basically it's inventions, and you'll have an exclusive right granted for an invention once

10:30.060 --> 10:35.420
 you go to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and you'll have to go through this artist's process

10:35.420 --> 10:40.140
 to actually get patent rights. At that point you'll be the inventor of that specific patent, but

10:40.140 --> 10:44.620
 you will have to go through that process in order for you to secure that right. That one won't be

10:44.620 --> 10:51.340
 as relevant today, so we'll focus mostly on copyright and trademarks. So copyrights protect

10:51.340 --> 10:57.740
 the original work, and it subsists, so it is basically curated for the time that you put that

10:57.740 --> 11:07.500
 in paper or in any kind of medium that is tangible, and you are the author who become the, basically

11:07.500 --> 11:13.900
 the owner of this copyright from that moment on. Trademark is an indicator of source, basically,

11:13.900 --> 11:20.620
 so you have words, phrases, symbols, signs, or a combination, and they basically distinguish the

11:20.620 --> 11:26.700
 source of goods or services, so basically like the Nike switch that you see, you associate that

11:26.700 --> 11:32.540
 with the source of being Nike for anything that has that specific symbol. So in the next slide,

11:35.020 --> 11:42.300
 we'll start with trademarks. I think the most contentious issues revolve around copyright,

11:42.300 --> 11:48.540
 so that trademarks, we could go briefly over what a trademark is and how to acquire this right,

11:49.180 --> 11:54.540
 and then we'll go into the more substantive issues of copyright. So starting with trademarks,

11:54.540 --> 12:02.140
 in the next slide, we have the definition of a trademark, so you have basically get an exclusive

12:02.140 --> 12:08.700
 right to use a mark in connection with some goods or services, and you get to protect that from

12:08.700 --> 12:12.940
 infringement on dilution, so from anyone using this mark in association with similar goods or

12:12.940 --> 12:19.900
 services. You basically have this right in perpetuity, so as long as you continue to renew it

12:19.900 --> 12:25.740
 and continue to use this right in commerce, so in whatever it is that you decide to use in association

12:25.740 --> 12:30.380
 with your goods or services, as long as you continue using that in commerce, and you continuously

12:31.100 --> 12:35.900
 renew it with the trademark office, if you do have a registration, then that continues to exist.

12:37.500 --> 12:42.300
 So basically, you have goods and services that you use, whatever it is you're using,

12:42.300 --> 12:48.540
 whether a symbol, marker, or a wording, or a combination in commerce, and that is associated

12:48.540 --> 12:54.700
 with specific classes that are considered basically just the categories in which you are using that

12:54.700 --> 13:01.260
 mark in association with. That's how the USPTO classifies them in NFTs, and we'll see this later,

13:01.260 --> 13:05.740
 the specific guidance as to where you should place these classes or how you should describe

13:05.740 --> 13:12.380
 these goods and services according to the USPTO, but I'll go into that in a little bit later. So

13:12.380 --> 13:20.940
 the next slide, please. So we have a lot of NFTs projects that have trademarked their names or

13:20.940 --> 13:26.940
 their brands or in association to anything that they've created. In 2021, actually, there were

13:26.940 --> 13:34.220
 about just a handful of trademarks, maybe 100 or so, and this year, there's been an influx of

13:34.220 --> 13:40.620
 trademarks just related to a metaverse NFTs. So we've seen a huge rise in trademark applications

13:40.620 --> 13:47.180
 that have been filed for specific classes related to NFTs. These classes, as I mentioned, categories

13:47.180 --> 13:55.180
 tend to be class 9 and 42 and some 35. So again, not to confuse you guys, these are just numbers

13:55.180 --> 14:01.900
 that kind of indicate some categories basically, and the majority of those are in class 9 because

14:01.900 --> 14:08.140
 they are considered by the USPTO as downloadable goods that are associated with an underlying

14:08.140 --> 14:15.020
 asset. So you still have to define what that asset is. So similarly, how we have what was

14:15.020 --> 14:19.100
 mentioned in the previous class, which you have the token and you purchase a token, not necessarily

14:20.060 --> 14:26.060
 one that you buy the token and the asset together, but the token relates or points or links back to

14:26.060 --> 14:32.780
 the underlying asset. Similarly, USPTO is using that same kind of definition to categorize this

14:32.780 --> 14:39.740
 trademark registrations. So most of them will be in class 9, all of them for the most part. If you

14:39.740 --> 14:47.580
 have a known downloadable asset or token that links back to something else, you further define

14:47.580 --> 14:52.140
 what that something else is basically, but it will remain in class 9 as a downloadable asset

14:52.140 --> 14:58.460
 basically. So Fidenza actually has a trademark for Fidenza. Then you have cryptopunks and a lot

14:58.460 --> 15:03.740
 of these are still in the stages of examination. So they'll go through a process of examination

15:03.740 --> 15:09.100
 before getting to the registration from right now. There's a back load since we have so many

15:09.100 --> 15:14.540
 trademarks for this specific classes of goods, and they are taking about nine to 10 months to

15:14.540 --> 15:19.100
 examine this. So we'll see what happens with this trademark applications. There are not

15:19.100 --> 15:29.820
 registrations yet, some of them. Next slide please. So you actually don't need to register your

15:29.820 --> 15:34.940
 trademark, but it is highly encouraged. So what that means is once you start using something in

15:34.940 --> 15:40.220
 commerce, you basically have a trademark by Commonwealth. So you start using that in commerce,

15:40.220 --> 15:46.060
 whatever that is that you use, but it is highly recommended for you to have a registration,

15:46.060 --> 15:51.500
 and you have to show that you're using that in commerce. And that is to show that consumers

15:51.500 --> 15:58.700
 are identifying your product or service with that specific trademark. So the reason why we

15:58.700 --> 16:03.820
 normally advise to have a registration is because you get the ability to enforce your trademark

16:03.820 --> 16:10.700
 rights, and it is highly advisable just because your rights are limited under common law if you

16:10.700 --> 16:15.340
 don't have that registration. And in order for you to bring that lawsuit, you have that registration

16:15.340 --> 16:21.340
 and it's kind of a proof that you actually have been using that in commerce across the United

16:21.340 --> 16:30.060
 States. So having said that, there are some protections that trademark does not extend to

16:30.060 --> 16:38.220
 basically, or they're commonly known as fair use, and they relate to two specific ones. So we have

16:38.220 --> 16:43.260
 classic and nominative fair use, and these are basically just acceptance. I don't want to call

16:43.260 --> 16:49.340
 it exceptions, but they just, trademark rights would not extend to this basically. So classic fair

16:49.340 --> 16:55.340
 use is when someone uses a trademark and is used to describe the goods or services. So basically

16:55.340 --> 17:01.020
 you're not using it to indicate source for whatever you are selling, but you're only using that other

17:01.020 --> 17:07.020
 trademark, someone else's rights to describe your specific goods. So for example, you're using it to

17:07.020 --> 17:13.500
 describe a service. So you're using a trademark for, I don't know, Apple to describe that you offer

17:14.140 --> 17:21.580
 technical services. And you say, you know, we service computers from Apple to Samsung, you're

17:21.580 --> 17:25.820
 not using that to indicate the source of your services and being Apple and Samsung, you're

17:25.820 --> 17:33.340
 basically using that to reference to your own services. Similarly, we have nominative use,

17:33.340 --> 17:39.420
 and you are using it, there's been some case law around nominative use and how much of it you're

17:39.420 --> 17:46.140
 allowed to use someone else's mark in order to describe something else basically. And it could

17:46.140 --> 17:50.780
 be really complex, which is why I kind of just want to breeze over it. This is going to come up

17:50.780 --> 17:56.940
 mostly in some of the case law that we have right now, or not even precedent yet, but some of the

17:56.940 --> 18:03.260
 cases that have been brought in NFC related cases against some infringement that has gone

18:03.260 --> 18:10.700
 on in the space. So common situations where you would use how fair use will be news reporting,

18:10.700 --> 18:17.100
 commentary, product review, parity, and some comparative advertising. So when you are using

18:17.100 --> 18:23.820
 it basically to make fun of or not make fun of it, create some sort of common relief around a

18:23.820 --> 18:28.140
 specific issue and you use somebody else's trademark. That's basically what that would

18:28.140 --> 18:34.140
 entail, but there's some very specific guidelines as to how you go through the definition of fair

18:34.140 --> 18:39.980
 use and where that actually is fair use in relation to all these situations. And hopefully

18:39.980 --> 18:46.460
 as not too complex. But next slide, please. So again, this is why I wanted to kind of

18:46.460 --> 18:51.900
 leave the fair use arguments for this, and this is because we have some trademark infringement

18:51.900 --> 19:02.220
 cases right now. Most of them are surrounding the creation of NFTs that represents some physical

19:02.220 --> 19:08.540
 items. So like that's basically Hermes and Mason Rothschild. So in Medaverkin's case,

19:08.540 --> 19:14.460
 that we'll come to know. In that case, and I think the majority of us have heard of it,

19:14.460 --> 19:21.020
 there was an NFC that was created that resembled the Metaberkin's bags, which are

19:21.020 --> 19:29.180
 quite famous and very expensive. And this designation or this NFT basically was quote

19:29.180 --> 19:36.380
 unquote commentary on the use of specific, it was a political commentary according to the creator.

19:36.380 --> 19:42.940
 However, if he made a significant amount of money, so they had Hermes International soon,

19:42.940 --> 19:48.300
 this creator, and we are still waiting for a decision. The last thing we heard was that

19:48.300 --> 19:54.860
 an injunction was that a motion to dismiss actually was failed. So it was rejected. So

19:54.860 --> 19:59.180
 the loss is going to continue. And I think this case is going to be very important because it's

19:59.180 --> 20:06.380
 going to define whether you have, if you have a trademark for a specific good that is physical.

20:06.380 --> 20:11.100
 So like the Metaberkin's trade dress and the actual trademark of the Birkin's bags,

20:12.220 --> 20:18.060
 whether those are too, you can conflate those basically. So whether you could have an infringement

20:18.060 --> 20:23.580
 because someone else is creating that in a digital form in an NFT. So this is going to determine

20:24.380 --> 20:29.580
 the extent or the scope of the protection of the current registrations for existing brands.

20:30.140 --> 20:34.460
 And then we have the Nike StockX. And this is a little bit different in that,

20:35.900 --> 20:41.580
 and I find this one particularly interesting because Nike in StockX are, again,

20:41.580 --> 20:48.140
 StockX is a reseller of goods and they are using NFTs in association with the shoes that

20:48.140 --> 20:56.220
 they resell. So most of the arguments are kind of surrounding the argument or the analogy that

20:56.220 --> 21:01.740
 is a receipt. So you're basically authenticating actual goods that you can then later on redeem

21:01.740 --> 21:07.420
 as the shoe themselves or they're associated to the shoes. The shoes are Nike's shoes,

21:07.420 --> 21:12.380
 essentially, in StockX because they're reseller. So this one's particularly interesting because

21:12.380 --> 21:19.100
 it brings a lot of kind of doctrines that we have not determined whether they're applicable

21:19.100 --> 21:23.660
 to the NFT space, such as the first sale doctrine and this first sale doctrine basically,

21:24.940 --> 21:30.220
 and I don't want to go into a rabbit hole, but you basically have the ability to sell

21:30.220 --> 21:34.380
 something once you purchase it. So once I buy a painting, I have the right to sell that.

21:34.380 --> 21:40.620
 And that would be like basically what some of the arguments that they're making in this case,

21:41.260 --> 21:46.860
 but these are all trademark related cases that we have yet to resolve. So we'll have the next

21:46.860 --> 21:52.300
 slide before I go in the rabbit hole and know the descriptions of the cases. So now we enter

21:52.300 --> 21:59.340
 into copyright, and this is particularly applicable to the NFT space. We'll go into the next slide,

21:59.340 --> 22:08.620
 please. Copyright creation is basically once you put something in a tangible medium. So if I write

22:08.620 --> 22:13.660
 something in a piece of paper and that's already a tangible and there's enough originality,

22:14.620 --> 22:18.700
 that's enough for me to have a copyright. And that's differentiated from a copyright,

22:18.700 --> 22:24.220
 from a copyright registration. They're separate. So when I say copyright, it's just basically you

22:24.220 --> 22:30.140
 own that copyright, that creation that you made. If you go through a registration process, we'll

22:30.780 --> 22:35.740
 talk about that later, but it's separate. So you own your copyright, that does not mean you

22:35.740 --> 22:45.580
 have a copyright registration. So right now, the laws recently changed from the Copyright Act in

22:45.580 --> 22:52.300
 1976. And you have the life of the author plus 70 years is the extent of your copyright. That's

22:52.300 --> 22:58.940
 how long it will be protected for. And you get with a copyright, you get a bundle of sticks or a

22:58.940 --> 23:04.220
 bundle of rights that we commonly recognize as this six basic rights that you have the right to

23:04.220 --> 23:11.580
 reproduce, prepare derivative work, distribute, perform, display, transmit. So with a copyright,

23:11.580 --> 23:16.940
 you get the right to kind of control this, this the ability to any of those things and exclude

23:16.940 --> 23:24.860
 anyone from doing any of those things. Next slide, please. So now in the reason why I'm going so

23:24.860 --> 23:30.220
 fast is because we're going to enter into a really kind of interesting points about all of these

23:30.220 --> 23:36.860
 issues. One of the issues in copyright is the originality and the fixation. So these are requirements

23:36.860 --> 23:42.700
 for you to have a copyright. The originality is basically a minimum degree of creativity. And

23:42.700 --> 23:51.820
 that's argued in not to get very, I guess, into a new nuances of the entity space. But generative

23:51.820 --> 23:58.540
 works are arguably all of them have the end of creativity, but someone may argue they do not.

23:59.180 --> 24:07.260
 So then we go into the authorship, which is partly the same argument I just made earlier about the

24:07.260 --> 24:15.900
 minimum degree of creativity, because if you use an AI system, for example, AI like Dali or any AI

24:15.900 --> 24:21.660
 platform or coding or anything else that kind of creates the work for you, you still would need that

24:21.660 --> 24:27.340
 level of creativity. And it's a although it's a low standard, you still will be questioned by the

24:27.340 --> 24:33.900
 copyright office about how you use the system and whether that is enough to have a, I guess,

24:33.900 --> 24:40.140
 personhood or human creativity by the human. Because otherwise, you will not be entitled to

24:40.140 --> 24:46.540
 that registration. But the originality comes up often in the infringement cases and that

24:46.540 --> 24:50.620
 registration process. So those are the two times that you'll see this coming to question.

24:51.820 --> 24:58.540
 And then the last thing we need is the fixation. So you'll have the tangible medium of expression

24:58.540 --> 25:03.260
 and whether that's sufficient. And you just need the minimal degree of creativity. Again,

25:03.260 --> 25:11.260
 that's kind of reemphasized there. We'll go into the next slide, please. And this is where it gets

25:11.260 --> 25:18.220
 fun. You have the human authorship requirement and the definition of author is not in the copyright

25:18.220 --> 25:23.260
 act. But they have clearly distinguished and established that you need a human creation

25:23.260 --> 25:31.660
 component. And this was established mostly by Supreme Court in this case, where they determined

25:31.660 --> 25:37.260
 that human authorship was essential to copyright protection. And then it was reemphasized by the

25:37.260 --> 25:42.380
 copyright office in the compendium, where they mentioned that a work must be created by a human

25:42.380 --> 25:48.620
 being. And then it was reemphasized in this really fun case where a monkey basically grabbed

25:48.620 --> 25:55.020
 someone else's camera and took some selfies. And then the copyright office did not grant

25:55.020 --> 26:00.380
 the registration because they said the animal basically was not a human and could not get this

26:00.380 --> 26:06.700
 copyright registration. And that is the actual selfie of the monkey. Next one, please.

26:09.660 --> 26:16.140
 So by default, the creator owns the copyright at the moment of fixation. Again, this is different

26:16.140 --> 26:23.420
 from the registration. And the physical work is not the same thing as ownership in that copyright.

26:23.420 --> 26:31.500
 So if I buy a painting by Botero, this Colombian artist, I could get the physical copy, but that

26:31.500 --> 26:37.180
 does not mean that I could start then using that same painting to distribute in advertising

26:37.180 --> 26:43.740
 or putting in a movie or use it for other purposes that are commercial or even non-commercial. So

26:44.460 --> 26:51.260
 unless they're following the fair use. But you purchase this painting, you do not get the copyright

26:51.260 --> 26:57.740
 and we'll see how that's similar to NSP space coming up. We'll go into the next slide, please.

27:00.620 --> 27:07.340
 Again, this is a kind of expanded definition of the human authorship requirements. Recently,

27:07.340 --> 27:17.260
 the copyright board dealt with a case by Dr. Thaler, where he tried to copyright a painting

27:17.260 --> 27:25.100
 or a work of art rather, I'm sorry, and he was called the entrance to paradise. And this work of

27:25.660 --> 27:32.620
 art was created by a machine that he coded called creative machine. And the problem here was that

27:32.620 --> 27:39.580
 he named the author the creative machine. So the author was the AI system itself.

27:40.220 --> 27:46.060
 He didn't name himself as the author, he named himself as the owner. So the output of this machine

27:46.060 --> 27:52.300
 and the author was the creative machine. So that is when it became an issue for the copyright

27:52.300 --> 27:58.380
 office and they decided not to grant this registration. And this was later on appealed and

27:58.380 --> 28:05.260
 he still lost it against the board and then he filed lawsuits in DC. And we'll see how that

28:05.260 --> 28:10.620
 turns out. But I think for the last we have heard of this is that they're not going to grant

28:10.620 --> 28:17.260
 him this registration because you have to have the level of authorship that human being as a creator.

28:17.260 --> 28:21.580
 This is different and I want to emphasize this because I have seen this in the space lately

28:21.580 --> 28:29.180
 where we read from some articles that there was a copyright registration issued for a comic strip,

28:29.180 --> 28:34.780
 I think was a comic strip where the AI machine was used. And that was different because the

28:34.780 --> 28:39.740
 author was not named as the AI machine and they copyright office did question the level of

28:39.740 --> 28:45.020
 creativity or the level of work from the human. Yeah, you could go to the next one. I think I'm

28:45.020 --> 28:52.140
 taking a little long so we'll go really quick on that over the next slide. These are the not

28:52.140 --> 28:58.620
 protected things under copyright. Basically you have also fair use similar to what we mentioned

28:58.620 --> 29:03.980
 for trademarks. And if you want to go to the next slide we'll go into this a little bit faster so

29:03.980 --> 29:09.980
 we can get to the fun stuff. Ideas, procedures, processes and systems. So basically anything

29:09.980 --> 29:14.860
 that's factual it would not be protected on the copyright just doesn't have enough level of creativity

29:14.860 --> 29:19.580
 for the most part that there will be one of the questions that you have when determining whether

29:19.580 --> 29:27.260
 that is fair use. And then both the main works so disclaiming any kind of works under CCO which

29:27.260 --> 29:31.420
 will also will co-relator are also not protected on the copyright once you kind of disclaim those

29:31.420 --> 29:37.100
 rights. So basically you give up or you waive all your rights to the creation that you made.

29:37.660 --> 29:43.740
 We could go on to the next slide so we'll move a little faster. Again this is a copyright

29:44.700 --> 29:50.300
 doctrine of fair use. And it's an affirmative defense and you have this four-part test that

29:50.300 --> 29:56.700
 I alluded to earlier. And these are four of the queries that the courts will look at when

29:56.700 --> 30:01.900
 determining whether a work was fair use and that should not be protected on the copyright,

30:01.900 --> 30:09.100
 therefore potentially no infringement. So they would use this and a case by case determination.

30:09.100 --> 30:16.380
 These are not exclusive to or not the spotters that you don't have to have. You could have a

30:16.380 --> 30:23.580
 little bit more on one of these factors than the others and the courts are kind of there's no

30:23.580 --> 30:29.580
 no bright area. There's no black and white. It's kind of a gray area where they they lean on this

30:29.580 --> 30:36.300
 four-part test. And normally this is used as an affirmative defense and we could go on to the next

30:36.300 --> 30:44.300
 slide. So this part I and I included this slide because I think it's important for us in this

30:44.300 --> 30:50.300
 space to understand a little bit of what works for hire are in the copyright context because

30:50.300 --> 30:56.540
 a lot of the projects right now that I've seen they contract out the creation of the work. So

30:56.540 --> 31:04.220
 they'll have a third party create the art or the music or the video for the NFT projects. So these

31:04.220 --> 31:11.420
 are commonly known as works for hire and they come into specific situations. So one would be

31:12.140 --> 31:18.140
 as an employee. So you create this work of whatever it is that you created for your employer,

31:18.140 --> 31:25.980
 then essentially your employer is the owner and the creator legally the creator of the of the work

31:26.540 --> 31:33.580
 and you give up basically your rights to that owner to that employer. And then the second

31:34.860 --> 31:42.540
 situation in which this comes about will be in these nine categories and unwriting agreement. So

31:42.540 --> 31:48.940
 you have a work for hire agreement basically and you would basically give up their rights

31:49.660 --> 31:55.900
 to that creation to the person who hired you. And these are usually commission works. So

31:56.700 --> 32:02.780
 one of those works will have to fall into these nine categories. And then if none of these takes

32:02.780 --> 32:10.060
 place you would basically enter into an agreement with whoever hired you or whoever you hired and

32:10.060 --> 32:14.780
 you will have an assignment. And we'll have a little bit more expanded definitions of what an

32:14.780 --> 32:21.660
 assignment is in the next few slides. But for the most part they serve work for hire situations

32:21.660 --> 32:26.860
 and they're very two specific situations in which this comes about. We'll have the next slide please.

32:30.460 --> 32:37.260
 This is also important in the space because creators often do this the works or do the

32:37.260 --> 32:45.420
 creations as joint authors. So as a team and this is basically works that are prepared by

32:45.420 --> 32:51.740
 two or more people. So authors, but they have to have the intention that the contributions be

32:51.740 --> 32:58.860
 one. So merge into inseparable parts or independent parts. So by unitary whole and the act is very

32:58.860 --> 33:05.660
 specific about what a joint work is. They would both have an undivided interest in the entirety

33:05.660 --> 33:11.020
 of the copyright and they can exploit the work on a non-exclusive basis without the permission

33:11.020 --> 33:17.740
 of the other. So basically they could have that non-exclusive use as long as they take

33:17.740 --> 33:23.580
 account of the other person and they give them their fair share of profits if they are exploiting

33:23.580 --> 33:29.740
 that. And as long as they don't harm the actual work. This is also important for any creators out

33:29.740 --> 33:34.860
 there in the entity space that are creating works with more than one person making sure that you

33:34.860 --> 33:39.900
 guys have an agreement in place where this is kind of clear as to what you're allowed and not

33:39.900 --> 33:47.580
 allowed to do as a joint author and there's an understanding of what that means. We'll go to

33:47.580 --> 33:55.500
 the next slide please. So we'll go into the registration process which I mentioned earlier.

33:56.300 --> 34:00.860
 The registration does not affect the nature of your copyright but it does affect your ability

34:00.860 --> 34:06.300
 to enforce these rights. Your rights will be limited. You will not be able to bring the federal

34:06.300 --> 34:14.300
 court lawsuits unless you have this registration or a registration rejection. So there's also

34:14.300 --> 34:19.020
 this is not often mentioned but if you did not get a registration from the copyright office you

34:19.020 --> 34:22.620
 could still bring lawsuits and you have to argue that you should have gotten the registration so

34:22.620 --> 34:27.580
 as part of there will be part of your argument but for the most part and just to for simplicity

34:27.580 --> 34:35.020
 you do need a registration to bring a lawsuit in the federal court system and get to enforce your

34:35.020 --> 34:43.180
 rights and that's to stop someone from infringing on your copyright and this is also an example of

34:43.180 --> 34:49.420
 what the copyright registration would look like. Fidenza which I mentioned earlier has a trademark

34:49.420 --> 34:53.580
 registration but they also have a copyright registration which is really interesting to me.

34:53.580 --> 35:01.420
 They have copyright registration on individual Fidenzas and I've looked at how many they have.

35:01.420 --> 35:06.380
 I don't remember the exact number but they this one's fidenza number 56 they actually number them

35:06.380 --> 35:11.020
 and they have individual they didn't copyright them as a collection of works but they copyright

35:11.020 --> 35:16.140
 each one of these individually which is very interesting. We'll go into the next slide.

35:16.140 --> 35:24.700
 So we'll get into it more of a guess debated discussion of what the transfers

35:24.700 --> 35:31.580
 in copyrights entail since they apply pretty heavily to the NFT space. We'll go into the next

35:31.580 --> 35:40.140
 slide please. So this is according to section one of the act it transfers an assignment mortgage

35:40.140 --> 35:44.700
 exclusive license or any other conveyance of a copyright or any exclusive rights comprised

35:44.700 --> 35:49.660
 in a copyright but not including non-exclusive license and I know it sounds like a mouthful

35:50.300 --> 35:57.340
 but just to make it into an analogy that's understandable is basically as if I sell you

35:57.340 --> 36:02.700
 my house if I sell you my house you have full rights and you have all the rights to that house

36:03.420 --> 36:08.060
 and that is different from me giving you a non-exclusive license which is the analogy is I

36:08.060 --> 36:13.020
 let you stay at my house and you could use my house for as long as I tell you that you could use

36:13.020 --> 36:16.620
 my house and you maybe I could tell you that you can only go in the kitchen or I could you

36:16.620 --> 36:22.700
 can only go in the room so I determine what kind of rights I give you with that not non-exclusivity

36:22.700 --> 36:27.420
 and by the non-exclusivity part I mean that I could also let my brother come into the house or

36:27.420 --> 36:31.980
 someone else come into the house so that's the difference between the full transfer so it does

36:31.980 --> 36:41.020
 an assignment and a non-exclusive license. The next slide please. This is more for visual I think

36:41.020 --> 36:48.300
 this is pretty kind of a simple way to kind of understand this transfers so you have the copyright

36:48.300 --> 36:52.460
 and you transfer all the rights so this is again kind of similar to selling the whole house so I

36:52.460 --> 36:57.340
 give you title to all and rights to the entire house I can't just come back to you later and say

36:57.340 --> 37:03.100
 you know give me back my house that's basically what this means I have to give you this right in

37:03.100 --> 37:10.940
 writing and I have to sign it um then you get all the same rights that you that I would get as if you

37:10.940 --> 37:19.340
 were the owner from conception and you then we go into the next one so that's the license and then

37:19.340 --> 37:27.340
 oh the previous one sorry yeah we'll go into the next bucket for a previous slide please yeah

37:27.340 --> 37:33.820
 so license then we have um the exclusive or the non-exclusive for the exclusive part

37:34.540 --> 37:40.380
 it's very similar to an assignment right except you also need it in writing you I will also have

37:40.380 --> 37:47.260
 to give these rights to you by signature and I have to sign them away to you and you only get this

37:47.260 --> 37:52.780
 rights uh it's an exclusive user so I can't give these rights to anyone else that is different from

37:52.780 --> 38:00.220
 a non-exclusive so you wouldn't be special in other words to get these rights to uh in the analogy

38:00.220 --> 38:06.220
 to borrow my house or to go into my house and this could be oral or implied also and we'll go into

38:06.220 --> 38:14.460
 the definitions of those uh in the next slide now the next slide please thank you um so there's a lot

38:14.460 --> 38:20.380
 of issues with the license in the entity space uh because I don't think we have a pretty clear

38:20.380 --> 38:27.420
 understanding of what the law is surrounding or surrounding these licenses so exclusive licenses

38:27.420 --> 38:33.020
 actually terminate at the earlier of one of those two years so 35 years from a date of publication

38:33.020 --> 38:40.460
 or 40 years from the time that you grant these rights um and the time of publication it again this

38:40.460 --> 38:46.060
 this may seem like uh it doesn't make it makes no sense but you could have a copyright registration

38:46.060 --> 38:54.700
 in unpublished works so um you may be able to have uh rights that you granted prior to publication

38:54.700 --> 39:01.260
 so that's how that would make sense so we also have the non-exclusive licenses so these are also

39:02.460 --> 39:07.100
 but you could have it in writing or verbally give these licenses for the most part they're

39:07.100 --> 39:12.860
 writing and they have a variety of termination procedures and that will be explained in the

39:12.860 --> 39:18.540
 actual licensing and license agreement that you grant and then you have an implied non-exclusive

39:18.540 --> 39:23.900
 license that could be terminable uh at will so whenever the person that granted them decides

39:24.940 --> 39:29.660
 and that is there's an exception to this and if you have an implied non-exclusive license

39:30.220 --> 39:37.740
 and this comes about in projects where there was no grant or so no mention of what kind of license

39:37.740 --> 39:44.140
 you got and you got an implied quote unquote license and um then it could be argued that

39:44.780 --> 39:51.020
 you paid consideration that was enough for the license to not be revocable otherwise it would

39:51.020 --> 39:56.220
 be uh revocable so like if you see the terms of use where it says you know this could be revoked

39:56.220 --> 40:01.660
 at any time basically, that's what that means but for the implied one where there is no writing no

40:01.660 --> 40:06.940
 mention of what you actually received when it was just implied based on conduct or you using the

40:06.940 --> 40:13.260
 license and them allowing it um if you had enough consideration the court will look at this consideration

40:13.260 --> 40:19.500
 as enough uh sort of like detrimental reliance so you relied on the what you've been using this

40:19.500 --> 40:27.740
 license for and then it becomes irrevocable so um there are some exceptions that I think will be

40:27.740 --> 40:33.020
 important to note and and I know it's just kind of a very dense area of law so and I'm probably going

40:33.020 --> 40:38.940
 really fast but just important to for us to note that there are exceptions to determination and those

40:38.940 --> 40:46.700
 are transfers by will so by uh testament one someone passes away by works for hire uh the works

40:46.700 --> 40:54.460
 made for hire because essentially your the creator is the um the creator is not the owner anymore

40:54.460 --> 41:00.540
 but the employer or whoever hired at that point he has those right now and then the grants um by

41:00.540 --> 41:08.940
 other federal laws so for example like you have um at a batman that had that was granted a license

41:08.940 --> 41:15.100
 to someone else in that batman use so like the actual character also had some trademarks in it

41:15.100 --> 41:20.700
 so if there were trademarks embedded into the use of that copyright then you can't terminate

41:20.700 --> 41:24.540
 that because then you know what will happen to those trademarks that were also granted under

41:24.540 --> 41:30.940
 that specific license so that's when that really often happens and then um also under foreign laws

41:30.940 --> 41:37.740
 which we will not go into but that's also another exception worth noting um and then we'll go into

41:37.740 --> 41:45.740
 derivative works and you have the authority to continue using the whatever you created so it

41:45.740 --> 41:51.900
 basically works like a layer so anything that you prepare under the grant or so under whatever

41:51.900 --> 41:56.460
 license you receive before the termination you continue to utilize that so like the layer so

41:56.460 --> 42:02.540
 like once you have that whatever you built upon it you can continue to use um after the termination

42:02.540 --> 42:08.460
 but it doesn't extend to any rights after the termination so you cannot continue to continue

42:08.460 --> 42:14.140
 to create more works um based on the first layer that you initially received once it is terminated

42:14.140 --> 42:22.220
 we'll go into the next slide please then we get to the uh the fund part and this is the

42:22.220 --> 42:27.740
 nft licenses and i think for this part point 65 tonight it's going to join me because i think

42:27.740 --> 42:31.980
 we'll get into more of the very uh dicey discussions in this area

42:35.180 --> 42:41.980
 so we could go into the next slide all right hello hello hello could you hear me

42:41.980 --> 42:50.300
 okay loud and clear well first of all thank you so much for that i know for everyone this was

42:50.300 --> 42:56.620
 probably a lot to absorb if this is not something that you've thought about in detail before in

42:56.620 --> 43:01.420
 fact even for me when i was looking at the materials and i think i know a decent amount

43:01.420 --> 43:07.180
 about this topic there were things i had to ask clarifying questions uh i had to read the slides

43:07.180 --> 43:11.660
 a few times the good thing is the slides are going to be available uh we will be available

43:11.660 --> 43:17.100
 in the chat we'll be available on Twitter and so we'll be able to follow up on these things

43:17.660 --> 43:23.820
 i would also say i think we're just going to have to run over of the one hour i mean i don't

43:23.820 --> 43:29.020
 think we'll be done in the next 15 minutes we're just getting to the juicy parts i hope all of

43:29.020 --> 43:33.580
 you can stay if you can't it's okay it'll be recorded you can watch the rest of it later

43:33.580 --> 43:38.060
 but i don't want to cut it short um because i think we have a lot of fun things to discuss

43:38.060 --> 43:46.220
 let me put some things in my words from a more nft perspective

43:47.100 --> 43:53.980
 and only if i get anything wrong you should interrupt me and then we'll see where the

43:53.980 --> 44:00.780
 really pressure points are i think this is a good slide here this slide 29 and on the slide

44:00.780 --> 44:09.580
 that we're on let's go back the base model when you buy an nft is exactly the same as if you buy

44:09.580 --> 44:16.220
 a traditional piece of art and i see this being an area of endless confusion particularly by

44:16.220 --> 44:21.900
 non-nft people right like they say oh well what rights do you have or your rights are unclear

44:21.900 --> 44:27.260
 or here are all these like extremely nuanced topics about what rights you might have to the IP

44:27.260 --> 44:36.060
 but of course off-chain pre-NFTs your default expectation if you bought a painting if you

44:36.060 --> 44:42.540
 bought a book if you bought a cd if you bought a movie if you bought any piece of art or medium

44:42.540 --> 44:47.260
 the default expectation is that you get no rights whatsoever you have a right to personal use

44:47.260 --> 44:54.620
 the copyright stays with the owner so if you know i famously bought an Andy Warhol tomato soup can

44:54.620 --> 45:00.460
 does not mean i am now the copyright owner of Andy Warhol soup cans and i'm going to make

45:00.460 --> 45:08.060
 t-shirts and pillows and posters the Andy Warhol estate owns the copyrights there you know if

45:08.060 --> 45:13.180
 you bought a Harry Potter book it does not mean you now own the Harry Potter franchise right you

45:13.180 --> 45:20.860
 have a license you can read it yourself and most NFTs in the generative art world in the one of one

45:20.860 --> 45:28.300
 world are sold under this model right your default expectation is if you have not heard otherwise

45:29.260 --> 45:33.100
 if there's not been something communicated otherwise if there are not terms and conditions

45:33.100 --> 45:39.820
 otherwise what you should expect you have is the right to that particular instance for your personal

45:39.820 --> 45:45.340
 use but no the IP of the creator has not been transferred to you so your default is exactly

45:45.340 --> 45:51.820
 the same and all of the interesting topics all of the ones where i think people are confused and

45:52.380 --> 45:59.820
 we're leaving seeing some challenging legal issues as the law is not yet adapted to an on-chain world

46:00.460 --> 46:07.260
 is where nft creators have tried to give more rights right things that you wouldn't actually

46:07.260 --> 46:13.020
 typically see off-chain and let's take a look at some of those let's go to the next pitch

46:13.020 --> 46:22.140
 oh yeah i guess i should address this before we get to that you know i think related to this

46:23.100 --> 46:28.380
 and i've spent a lot of time with this oddly i've spent time on this topic even with people

46:28.380 --> 46:36.620
 who are crypto native and they say well i mean sure you have the token but the jpeg as we saw

46:36.620 --> 46:45.340
 last week might be on ipfs or our weave on a server and i can download it all by myself

46:47.020 --> 46:54.620
 and of course the correct answer is so what you can download i can go download the Google logo

46:54.620 --> 47:00.220
 all by myself i can right click save as the Google logo and then the google logo is on my desktop

47:00.220 --> 47:07.660
 and that means quite literally absolutely nothing right it does not make me the owner of the google

47:07.660 --> 47:14.780
 logo it does not make me the owner of google uh larry and Sergi are not trembling in their seats

47:14.780 --> 47:19.580
 that i've right click saved their logo it means absolutely nothing right and this is the correct

47:19.580 --> 47:23.900
 the actual practical correct analysis so i could say why does it doesn't mean anything i mean

47:23.900 --> 47:28.540
 strictly speaking if i started using the Google logo i'm probably violating someone's copy right

47:28.540 --> 47:37.020
 so strictly speaking i might be breaking the law right but even that practically speaking it just

47:37.020 --> 47:43.020
 doesn't matter and in an on-chain world where you know this was very common last year people would

47:43.020 --> 47:51.180
 download punk 6529 and tweet at me and say i have punk 6529 now okay that's great i mean the tokens

47:51.180 --> 47:59.740
 in my wallet you have a jpeg um it's clear who owns punk 6529 and if there's any doubt about this

47:59.740 --> 48:05.260
 try and sell the jpeg right the market value for the right click saved as jpeg is zero so

48:06.060 --> 48:09.740
 i want to address and i'm guessing half the audience three quarters of the audience

48:09.740 --> 48:13.740
 has already passed us but we might have some new people in the audience new people to nfts

48:14.300 --> 48:20.460
 it's a common stumbling block to people new in the space but it truly genuinely in my opinion

48:20.460 --> 48:24.220
 and Ellie if you have a different view we share it i just think it means literally absolutely

48:24.220 --> 48:37.660
 nothing it's a non-issue agreed yeah okay all right valentino um let me skip this because it's

48:37.660 --> 48:42.940
 actually fairly technical and we can come back and discuss this if we need to keep going

48:42.940 --> 48:54.620
 okay let me let's talk about the punks because i think this is super super interesting and

48:55.340 --> 49:01.980
 let's think about the two main frameworks that are might be different than the traditional

49:01.980 --> 49:08.700
 framework are where people are trying to grant commercial rights along with the token

49:08.700 --> 49:15.420
 or where people are saying we're putting the work in the public domain quote unquote cc0

49:15.420 --> 49:20.220
 we'll come to that in the next section let's talk about commercial rights because in some ways

49:20.220 --> 49:24.620
 this is the one that's most legally complicated you know the traditional model is not legally

49:24.620 --> 49:28.620
 complicated the public domain model is actually not legally complicated it's well understood

49:29.260 --> 49:35.420
 it's the licensing model that is legally complicated and the reason we have the

49:35.420 --> 49:43.740
 crypto punks license here is that over the commercial licensing licenses i think it's

49:43.740 --> 49:50.300
 the most well thought out it's the most complete uh you go clearly put a lot of work into it is

49:50.300 --> 49:56.220
 certainly much more thought out than the board apes license and the Mutant apes license which

49:56.220 --> 50:00.300
 you know Bored apes license a couple of paragraphs long and it's not totally clear what it's trying

50:00.300 --> 50:08.380
 to say whereas the crypto punks license is clear what it says is if you have a crypto punks token

50:09.820 --> 50:18.700
 you can commercially exploit your punk not of course anyone else's punk not any of the

50:18.700 --> 50:24.540
 underlying elements in your punk right my punk has a hoodie i can't take a punk-style hoodie

50:24.540 --> 50:32.220
 and exploit that individually i have to exploit punk 6529 specifically you can create derivative

50:32.220 --> 50:39.020
 works you can have sub licensees you can even apply for a trademark for your punk not of course

50:39.020 --> 50:45.740
 you can't use the general yuga trademarks for crypto punks so it is as permissive as you can get

50:45.740 --> 50:53.740
 for the actual owner of the token let's say that's bucket one bucket two there's been some thought

50:53.740 --> 51:01.180
 into what happens if you sell the token further and what they say is if you've sub licensed

51:01.180 --> 51:07.340
 or you've made derivatives and then you sell the token to the next person everything that you have

51:07.340 --> 51:16.860
 done today holds but you can't do new things right so let's say i've made 10 000 little 6529 punks

51:16.860 --> 51:23.260
 and then i sell my punk to Ellie i can still like sell off my inventory of little 6529 punks but i

51:23.260 --> 51:35.820
 can't make a new derivative there's also some uh well let me stop there this is all this is to

51:35.820 --> 51:42.940
 me all of the good news right now there's a couple of bad news from the perspective of

51:43.660 --> 51:48.860
 you're fully crypto native you want to live on a blockchain right you know what's the bad

51:48.860 --> 51:55.180
 news well the bad news here and i understand why it's there is since it's a license since you have

51:55.180 --> 52:00.940
 an ongoing relationship with yuga you see yuga like any kind of normal big American company

52:00.940 --> 52:07.260
 then puts things in there like but we can terminate the license or you're not allowed to do certain

52:07.260 --> 52:12.940
 things hate speech or trading with sanctioned entities or what have you say well why would you

52:12.940 --> 52:18.940
 want to do anyway no one's going to do that deliberately right and into some level i believe

52:18.940 --> 52:26.380
 it's yuga uh covering their butts because you know they don't want to indirectly be in business

52:26.380 --> 52:32.860
 with a sanctioned entity but it's also moving a variety of obligations on a token holder

52:32.860 --> 52:39.500
 but they don't have in if you own a bitcoin or an ether right it's not your bitcoin or ether can't

52:39.500 --> 52:47.340
 be taken away if you use bitcoin to engage in speech that is not permissible in your country

52:47.340 --> 52:55.260
 right but theoretically your license to your punk could be uh theoretically uh and it's different than

52:55.260 --> 53:01.740
 you know certain applications that use bitcoin or ether have been sanctioned like tornado cash

53:01.740 --> 53:07.100
 right but the protocol itself is not really sanctioned here if the protocol is the token it is

53:07.100 --> 53:14.060
 is through the license there is a counterparty risk a centralization risk right that's i would say

53:14.060 --> 53:23.260
 that's bucket one bucket two which i get i understand why it's there the license has a

53:23.260 --> 53:29.420
 general term there says it can be changed i know why it's there because it's a brand new space

53:29.420 --> 53:35.820
 and the laws might change and they might need to adapt the license to new laws so it's a sensible

53:35.820 --> 53:45.020
 and logical thing to do and i have every view that yuga has good faith here and their general

53:45.020 --> 53:49.420
 model is to assign the commercial rights to the users but strictly speaking the license

53:49.420 --> 53:55.020
 doesn't can change to mark change and say something different than what it says there and then the

53:55.020 --> 54:01.100
 third thing that this was something i learned through the preparation of this session

54:01.100 --> 54:04.220
 and this i want to ask Ellie if i understood it right i might have gotten it wrong in which case

54:04.220 --> 54:09.820
 it'll be good to be corrected i had previously known to transferring a copyright

54:10.700 --> 54:14.380
 required a written agreement and there's a whole bunch of consternation of if a

54:15.100 --> 54:19.020
 you know on-chain transaction is a written agreement right of course as an intestine it's

54:19.020 --> 54:25.660
 probably not um but then what i saw is that an exclusive license also requires a written agreement

54:25.660 --> 54:31.660
 to be transferred and i think this license is primarily an exclusive license as it relates

54:31.660 --> 54:38.780
 to 6529 it's not no it's non-exclusive it will be a non-exclusive license

54:39.980 --> 54:47.180
 why would that be so do you want to go back to i think they do mention that at some point

54:47.180 --> 54:53.980
 in the terms that it's a non-exclusive worldwide license it's not exclusive um otherwise it would

54:53.980 --> 54:59.980
 literally say it this is an exclusive license so basically just one part you as a person would

54:59.980 --> 55:04.460
 get it and if i'm not mistaken i know we had one side where you had like the full terms

55:05.180 --> 55:11.820
 but it says it's a non-exclusive um license but that one yeah it would have to be in writing as well

55:11.820 --> 55:18.140
 and i guess going back to your point i this has not been tested in court yet but there are some

55:18.140 --> 55:22.620
 arguments that you can make that some licenses maybe when you guys intentionally say that you

55:22.620 --> 55:26.780
 know i give you all rights i give you a commercial rights but then it gives you all this other kind

55:26.780 --> 55:31.820
 of like as long as you buy to this and kind of alludes to a it is a license instead of just an

55:31.820 --> 55:37.820
 assignment on rights um and it hasn't been tested in court whether you just transferring the token

55:37.820 --> 55:43.420
 itself in connection to this license it's it's enough to have a cryptographic signature that

55:43.420 --> 55:48.700
 is in writing enough for you to have agreed upon this but again none of this has been tested in

55:48.700 --> 55:54.460
 this kind of it's it's a second issue that will deal with with the subsequent buyer with that

55:54.460 --> 55:59.580
 even that license the initial license is even enforceable against the uh next buyer the

55:59.580 --> 56:03.980
 so person a and person b so whether you could enforce that gets the person b but going back

56:03.980 --> 56:11.820
 to your point yeah i think that um it is a non-exclusive license and so i pulled it up it's

56:11.820 --> 56:17.420
 actually very funny so they say it's exclusive and they also say this is the funny part kid is

56:17.420 --> 56:23.180
 universe wide i don't know how that jurisdiction works universe wide so it says yeah an exclusive

56:23.180 --> 56:27.900
 universe wide royalty free something some license of a license to reproduce a shipment

56:27.900 --> 56:32.380
 prepared derivative works publicly display publicly perform transmit and otherwise exploit

56:32.380 --> 56:39.100
 your cryptopunk art is that the most reason one the previous one may have uh i know that they have

56:39.100 --> 56:43.740
 for example like not you got that state non-exclusive in this one i don't know if you

56:43.740 --> 56:49.260
 i'll pull it up too i know we have the link there but if it's exclusive it has to be writing so um

56:49.260 --> 56:53.980
 that would imply that you had that this will be sufficient enough and normally you have like to

56:53.980 --> 56:59.500
 ascend something so like you have to click that you do agree to this right um that was sufficient

56:59.500 --> 57:04.700
 writing um but that would imply that during the minting process you would have had to agree

57:04.700 --> 57:09.420
 and then this goes back to many issues that have not been tested because this was uh again this

57:09.420 --> 57:13.980
 was amended so we don't even know if this could be enforceable or there could be an argument that

57:13.980 --> 57:20.940
 it's not enforceable against it the people who bought in post amendments so this has not been

57:20.940 --> 57:26.860
 tested yet in court there's no precedent for this one yet right so and i think this goes to a very

57:26.860 --> 57:31.980
 interesting point like regardless of what it specifically says right and the Bored apes

57:31.980 --> 57:39.100
 license for sure was trying to transfer the copy copyright right and here are things as far as i

57:39.100 --> 57:50.860
 can tell have not been tested or it's unclear a if you are a secondary buyer which could be on

57:52.620 --> 57:57.900
 a normal marketplace or an exchange or in some type of smart contract or even peer to peer

57:59.340 --> 58:05.740
 are you bound by the license and how right and you've never actually accepted that license

58:05.740 --> 58:10.700
 that's number one number two if someone is trying to transfer copyright or an exclusive license

58:12.300 --> 58:23.980
 even if you have a terms and conditions at the bottom does this qualify as a written agreement

58:25.900 --> 58:31.260
 three the marketplace terms the support i wanted to skip over before because i think it's very

58:31.260 --> 58:37.260
 complicated the marketplace terms tend to be generic right so most of the volume happens in

58:37.260 --> 58:42.460
 open sea right on open not for punks but for everything else open sea has fairly generic

58:42.460 --> 58:47.020
 terms it does not pass through the terms of every single collection and so to the degree you're

58:47.820 --> 58:51.500
 click accepting something an open sea you're accepting the generic open sea terms not the

58:51.500 --> 59:00.780
 collection specific terms and so arguably all of this stuff is open to interpretation challenge

59:00.780 --> 59:05.740
 or it applies in the first place right and i think some of the people who are negative on this are

59:05.740 --> 59:13.660
 like well it's it's bad but i'll give you my counter argument here and this is again i'd love

59:13.660 --> 59:20.860
 your view on this and one is a practical one another one is a future one a practical one

59:23.340 --> 59:29.660
 let's say it doesn't apply right but yuga intends genuinely i'm a hundred percent

59:29.660 --> 59:36.540
 certain of this it wants its community to do projects with their IP that's the whole point

59:36.540 --> 59:40.940
 of things right they're trying to get 10 000 people working to promote the collection as

59:40.940 --> 59:48.220
 opposed to just a centralized team so to the degree that the buyer more or less acts like its

59:49.900 --> 59:56.940
 applies and the seller or the issuer acts like it supplies doesn't matter i mean like if who's going to

59:56.940 --> 1:00:05.260
 who if generally your concern would be as a buyer of one of these things that the issuer

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:11.580
 will enforce against you so i don't want you using your punk this way right i don't want you

1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:16.940
 making pillows pillowcases with your punk but yuga very clearly does want you to make pillowcases

1:00:16.940 --> 1:00:21.260
 with your punk or beer with your punk or coffee brands with your punk that's exactly what they

1:00:21.260 --> 1:00:28.300
 want you to do right and so since they want you to do it where would the practical risks come

1:00:28.300 --> 1:00:35.180
 that's that's question one and then question two is maybe what will happen is in time and

1:00:35.180 --> 1:00:40.540
 i don't think it's imminent but maybe in the next three to five years we will have legislation

1:00:40.540 --> 1:00:46.540
 to cover topics like this and the analogy that comes to mind for me is there used to be this

1:00:46.540 --> 1:00:53.420
 debate in the 90s about electronic transactions and how can electronic transactions ever be valid

1:00:53.420 --> 1:00:58.860
 because you have to sign with a pen and you can't sign with a pen on the internet right there's a

1:00:58.860 --> 1:01:02.700
 lot of things that used to say you have to sign with a pen and then i think it was in 1996 the

1:01:02.700 --> 1:01:09.500
 united states passed the e-signature act and the e-signature act in one stroke said well all those

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:15.020
 electronic transactions are fine they count exactly as much as if they were signed with a pen

1:01:15.020 --> 1:01:20.300
 and this enabled a whole swath of e-commerce to come to life and you know this has been absolutely

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:25.500
 fine that's why we have e-commerce today and then i so i wondered even if there are issues

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:33.340
 now in this kind of teething period if eventually you know the legislation will change it was

1:01:33.340 --> 1:01:40.460
 interesting the copyright office decision on the ai art you could tell they were uncomfortable

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:45.580
 with the decision they were making right they were just saying look we don't have the right

1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:52.860
 to assign copyright to an ai this is congress's job to fix right like if congress wants

1:01:52.860 --> 1:01:56.220
 to do this they should fix it and then we're happy to do it you could tell them they didn't feel

1:01:56.220 --> 1:01:59.820
 comfortable saying all this work's not copyrightable we have to follow the letter of the law and the

1:01:59.820 --> 1:02:05.420
 letter of the law says there needs to be human and if they want to cover you know human slash machine

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:10.460
 partnerships they should change the law and so what are your views on this like what's the practical

1:02:10.460 --> 1:02:15.660
 risk today that even if this license is not a hundred percent correct enforceable etc what

1:02:15.660 --> 1:02:22.540
 practical risk might a punk holder a board abe holder have and you know can you imagine the

1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:30.460
 law changing in the future so i think that these are all unaddressed questions that i don't know

1:02:30.460 --> 1:02:35.420
 that i don't know anyone that have the answers to i think the most important thing to know is that

1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:41.740
 because this is so new i think that legally we need some changes but i also think

1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:47.340
 technologically we need some changes and i say that because if you were able to transfer the token

1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:52.540
 with a license that was available and that required someone to accept the license upon

1:02:52.540 --> 1:02:58.620
 each transfer and this was abided by all platforms we would solve a lot of issues with that because

1:02:58.620 --> 1:03:06.140
 then people would have the privity of contract with each one each transaction so i think that

1:03:06.140 --> 1:03:14.460
 is not just legal but also technologically we need to mature and as far as risk goes i think

1:03:14.460 --> 1:03:21.260
 until we see some more kind of issues with this space we don't know i would say this is a

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:28.620
 litigious question as far as who would want to bring any sort of issues regarding this licenses

1:03:28.620 --> 1:03:35.260
 and their enforceability that would be the risk is why would anyone want to contest this and

1:03:35.260 --> 1:03:41.340
 again i think most of the issues that i have in this space is not just legal questions

1:03:41.340 --> 1:03:46.780
 but that technological feature and then some of the misunderstandings as far as the amendment

1:03:46.780 --> 1:03:54.060
 goes so like what how do we know which license applies if this is amendable at any point so

1:03:54.060 --> 1:03:59.180
 like let's say that they're amended multiple times they say let's say you go lab decides to amend it

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:05.900
 three four five times upon this and in the next five years so then at what point do we know which

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:11.180
 license apply to whom and was there any privity of contract to say okay this license number three

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:19.180
 apply to buyer five or buyer six or buyer six hundred um so yeah i would say um that technologically

1:04:19.180 --> 1:04:24.460
 we could fix this and then uh the law would definitely have to evolve with that technology

1:04:26.860 --> 1:04:33.660
 amazing i i guess well they'll have to update the license on shame so then you can see

1:04:33.660 --> 1:04:40.460
 which license applies to which to which user right yeah i mean yeah and and i think that

1:04:40.460 --> 1:04:45.100
 technologically we could solve a lot of things and if we if we if only the platforms would kind of

1:04:45.100 --> 1:04:49.740
 like uh accept some of the smart contracts i know some companies that are like trying to or

1:04:49.740 --> 1:04:54.060
 some platforms that are trying to kind of have this where like you upon each transfer you're

1:04:54.060 --> 1:04:58.220
 gonna have to click yes and be able to like read it so kind of like when we go on websites right now

1:04:58.220 --> 1:05:02.700
 and accept the terms of use um so each buyer will have an actual understanding what they're

1:05:02.700 --> 1:05:08.860
 purchasing and whether there's any encumbrances or liens or any sub-licensed um rights that have

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:14.940
 been passed to a different person i think that technologically we could solve the the legal

1:05:14.940 --> 1:05:22.380
 issues too oh i love what you were just describing i mean this would let me put it back in my

1:05:22.380 --> 1:05:31.660
 words that technologically we could bring the terms and conditions and the sub licenses and

1:05:31.660 --> 1:05:38.460
 changes of these and things that were created under the sub licenses and so on shame and at

1:05:38.460 --> 1:05:45.100
 that point you can contract around the number one but it only gets me excited and you can

1:05:45.100 --> 1:05:54.140
 programmatically access them right and because right now i do feel this all the commercial

1:05:54.140 --> 1:06:01.900
 rights type projects do have a foot in both worlds right you have this global instant

1:06:01.900 --> 1:06:09.340
 digitally native permissionless token flying around everywhere and then for it to work this contract

1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:20.700
 that literally on the cryptopunks site is a pdf right and so you're saying maybe we can develop

1:06:20.700 --> 1:06:29.260
 better technology to bring the pdf side into the programmatic side i think so because right now we

1:06:29.260 --> 1:06:34.220
 have three three kind of different layers and it's kind of like a sandwich where like you have like

1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:39.340
 and it should not be it should not be for the legal perspective so like you're basically saying

1:06:39.340 --> 1:06:45.180
 i sell you this house but someone else is hosting whatever rights i have and that's some

1:06:45.180 --> 1:06:51.660
 that's somewhere else is normally like an aws or at the best an ipfs that holds those rights

1:06:51.660 --> 1:06:56.620
 which is the terms of use that i'm mentioning so that should not live separate from the token

1:06:56.620 --> 1:07:02.060
 and and if those were hand in hand together just like even we had just two layers where like the

1:07:02.060 --> 1:07:07.580
 token itself has the rights but also the metadata was i think again i think the technology is to

1:07:07.580 --> 1:07:12.940
 mature so that people could really readily like read that and be able to understand it because

1:07:12.940 --> 1:07:17.660
 right now who's going to go into the ether scan and go through the metadata and click on links

1:07:17.660 --> 1:07:23.260
 or be able to know where to go in the metadata to click on the link that kind of takes you to the

1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:28.620
 to the terms of use like it's a lot of steps that i don't think people are going to if a judge saw it

1:07:28.620 --> 1:07:33.500
 they may see you know there was no actual understanding or knowledge or a sense um through

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:37.180
 the terms of use because nobody's going to go through this metadata process

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:45.420
 that makes perfect sense okay let's go to cc0 and public domain let's skip forward a few slides

1:07:45.420 --> 1:07:58.780
 and go go to the next slide actually okay my sense of where we have ended up today in

1:08:00.060 --> 1:08:06.780
 so-called cc0 so creative commons zero which is a form of license that tries as much as possible

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:12.380
 to put the copyrights in the public domain and the reason i say as much as possible in some

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:17.180
 countries there are certain rights that you cannot put in the public domain if you want to but

1:08:17.180 --> 1:08:21.980
 for an American person i think you can generally you can put all your rights in the public domain

1:08:23.820 --> 1:08:31.260
 i believe it's an alternative way to solve some of the issues we just spoke about i think that's

1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:36.140
 how people are thinking of them let me give you my sense so because i've spoken to a lot of the

1:08:36.140 --> 1:08:46.460
 folks who have done this right and their assessment of the solution is not okay we have to agree on

1:08:46.460 --> 1:08:50.940
 a standardized format for legal contracts in terms and conditions and we'll bring them on

1:08:50.940 --> 1:08:54.940
 chains to coordinate all the exchanges and do all these things their view is all different they say

1:08:54.940 --> 1:08:59.740
 okay well that sounds like an awful lot of work let's take a completely different approach first

1:08:59.740 --> 1:09:10.860
 of all let's take the approach that encourages maximum virality right the attention drives

1:09:10.860 --> 1:09:18.540
 everything online and if it is the case that having 10 000 people working on your further

1:09:18.540 --> 1:09:26.860
 developing your ip is better than having um the 10 people in your marketing team working on your ip

1:09:26.860 --> 1:09:34.620
 well it's even better to let the 2.3 billion people online further develop your ip and your ip

1:09:34.620 --> 1:09:38.460
 will become more famous and important to get more attention if anyone can work on it so

1:09:38.460 --> 1:09:48.300
 that's one theory i think the second theory is even if someone let's say you 6529 have the

1:09:48.300 --> 1:09:54.380
 rights to punk 6529 and let's say you had a kind of strict view of how only you wanted to

1:09:54.380 --> 1:10:01.100
 to develop it and if someone else started doing things with your punk you should chase them around

1:10:01.100 --> 1:10:07.420
 and legally i think part of saying like look this is chasing people around legally online

1:10:07.420 --> 1:10:13.820
 in 99.999 of cases it's not worth effort anyway right like i mean it's people copy things all the

1:10:13.820 --> 1:10:20.300
 time online and mostly you don't bother chasing them around and say like look it's it's effectively

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:26.780
 it might be legally enforceable but it might be practically not hugely enforceable so i

1:10:26.780 --> 1:10:31.580
 don't want to have to even think about that let's let's say point number two point number three of

1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:39.100
 this this was x copies point that any version of trying to do it through a licensing agreement

1:10:39.100 --> 1:10:44.940
 is going to lead to centralization there is always going to be a counterparty the counterparty is

1:10:44.940 --> 1:10:52.860
 always going to want things like oh i need the right to change this agreement for logical reasons

1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:58.700
 the laws might change and they might be required to change the agreement but nonetheless it's never

1:10:58.700 --> 1:11:06.460
 the content the art is never really free because there's always a counterparty and a counterparty

1:11:06.460 --> 1:11:11.340
 that in some ways has more power than you do right like that they can change the contract you can't

1:11:11.340 --> 1:11:20.780
 right and so and then the biggest all these issues on is it enforceable is it not enforceable is it

1:11:20.780 --> 1:11:24.700
 written transfer did it happen through an exchange did not happen through an exchange was it on mint

1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:29.500
 which version applies take all away right you don't have to think about it's a huge simplification

1:11:29.500 --> 1:11:38.300
 you don't have to worry about them at all right there's who can i own some public domain pfp some

1:11:38.300 --> 1:11:44.540
 mfers for example and i don't have to think about these issues at all because it's clear who can

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:50.220
 use that art anyone right absolutely anyone the product of user i can also use it but so can anyone

1:11:50.220 --> 1:11:59.420
 else so it simplifies and then i think what underlies all this all of this is the idea

1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:07.260
 that i'm stealing now from punk 4156 and i think in a few days we'll have him on here on the

1:12:07.260 --> 1:12:12.860
 course and so we'll really dig into this then he said something a long time ago that i found very

1:12:12.860 --> 1:12:20.780
 interesting was the right mental model here is provenance not copyright and how i understood it

1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:28.460
 is the following pre nfts let's say you had a really nice image and then it starts getting

1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:32.780
 copied which happens all the time right you see an example here with cats some art happens all the

1:12:32.780 --> 1:12:39.020
 time someone posts a beautiful photo on Instagram and then like 5 000 people copy right they posted

1:12:39.020 --> 1:12:43.100
 themselves they don't attribute it and now you don't know which one's the original because

1:12:43.100 --> 1:12:49.420
 everyone's supposed to get everywhere this doesn't really apply in nfts right like the

1:12:49.420 --> 1:12:59.820
 provenance of who actually minted it who owns it who the artist said owns it what who the artist

1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:07.260
 recognizes as the owner it's super clear it's the person with the token to the degree that there's

1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:14.540
 a person with a token then everyone else that's running around with the art is in a way some

1:13:14.540 --> 1:13:20.860
 form of right click saving us right now or to think of it a more positive light is driving value back

1:13:20.860 --> 1:13:24.460
 to the token holder right they're creating attention but they're still only one original yes

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:31.980
 they can use it but there's only one original now here we're in completely simultaneously

1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:37.820
 completely untested waters and extremely tested waters why do i say extremely tested waters

1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:45.340
 the vast you open an art history book the vast majority of art in an art history book anything

1:13:45.340 --> 1:13:53.340
 before 1924 is that the right state is in the public domain so it's not like this is something

1:13:53.340 --> 1:14:00.060
 brand new to the world you know any van Gogh is in the public domain right uh books from the 18th

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:05.980
 century in the public domain all these things are in the public domain right Romeo and Juliet are in

1:14:05.980 --> 1:14:11.740
 the public domain right they've been in the public domain for a long time now and so what an artist

1:14:11.740 --> 1:14:16.700
 or creator is doing is accelerating that process and we're not going to wait until my death plus

1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:21.820
 x years we're going to put in the public domain now this is what i'm going to respect as the

1:14:21.820 --> 1:14:33.900
 originals and then the global culture can remix this uh together and so it strikes me and i'm going to

1:14:33.900 --> 1:14:40.780
 ask a narrow question that will go to the economic question from a legal perspective this one seems

1:14:40.780 --> 1:14:47.900
 straightforward right like there's not a ton of outstanding issues if let's say i'm an American

1:14:47.900 --> 1:14:55.500
 i create a piece of art i put it in the public domain are there any ambiguities can we just go

1:14:55.500 --> 1:15:02.620
 ahead and treat it as such i wouldn't say there's ambiguities i would just say there's lack of

1:15:02.620 --> 1:15:10.860
 control for the creators so like let's say that um there's you have that cco like copyright uh or

1:15:10.860 --> 1:15:17.340
 lack of copyright rather image and then um someone starts using it with the regulatory political

1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:23.580
 campaigns then there will be no control over you kind of having any say to prevent any of those

1:15:23.580 --> 1:15:30.380
 associations from happening um that will be the only kind of negative that i would say um but i do

1:15:31.260 --> 1:15:37.260
 i do understand the Moonbirds kind of uh did this and i think that they have other issues other than

1:15:37.260 --> 1:15:40.940
 they just issuing this i think they should have done this for the beginning without the intent

1:15:40.940 --> 1:15:49.660
 but um i think the that would be um it's easier to manage you they wouldn't have to kind of legally

1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:57.980
 enforce any rights uh for on behalf of any holders either so financially and legally it would make

1:15:57.980 --> 1:16:03.100
 sense for them to do that but they only again they only get negative to it is the lack of control

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:08.060
 or associations that you may not want with your art so that would be the negative thing i would say

1:16:08.060 --> 1:16:13.500
 about that sure right but legally it's clear right it might operationally have the outside

1:16:14.300 --> 1:16:17.820
 it's clear all right let's let's see the next few slides

1:16:20.220 --> 1:16:27.260
 yeah so this is this is where i think we are today in pfp projects my sense is in pfp projects

1:16:29.020 --> 1:16:35.420
 the whole quote unquote game now is being played between commercial licenses and cco licenses

1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:41.580
 is releasing a pfp project today and saying you just have a personal use license only

1:16:42.220 --> 1:16:47.980
 is probably now market uncompetitive right and for PFP projects which are different than

1:16:48.940 --> 1:16:57.020
 art oriented NFTs i think what we'll play out here and i don't know the answer to this right

1:16:57.020 --> 1:17:04.620
 and we're going to just have to wait and see which of the following two factors is going to

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:13.340
 end up being more powerful the case for commercial licenses is if i know i have the exclusive license

1:17:13.340 --> 1:17:20.780
 for that board eight that's one of my board apes i might be willing to invest in it because i know

1:17:20.780 --> 1:17:28.700
 i can monetize it if i invest it and if i knew that even if i invested it you could just take it

1:17:28.700 --> 1:17:33.260
 and use it yourself they may be less willing to invest it right that's the case for commercial

1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:39.900
 rights the again the economic human behavior case let's say and on the public domain side the flip

1:17:39.900 --> 1:17:46.220
 side will be like well sure that everything you said is true but in practice most people won't

1:17:47.420 --> 1:17:52.300
 manage to do very much with these things themselves and when you enable the whole world

1:17:53.020 --> 1:17:57.340
 to help you you'll actually get further i another way of saying it is

1:17:57.340 --> 1:18:04.460
 is i think the public domain folks will say yes you'll get a smaller percentage of a much bigger

1:18:04.460 --> 1:18:09.660
 pie right the value that's going to somehow accrue to you the token holder in sort of ambiguous

1:18:09.660 --> 1:18:17.420
 ways today right it's not totally clear that like let's say you le take my cryptotodes and make a

1:18:17.420 --> 1:18:22.700
 super successful clothing line with it you don't owe me anything right you could make lots of money

1:18:22.700 --> 1:18:29.100
 with it and i'll be like oh yes but i'm gaining influence and attention on the original but

1:18:29.100 --> 1:18:33.580
 i mean it's unclear if that actually ever converts back to money to me that's the question but

1:18:33.580 --> 1:18:36.860
 conceptually i think it's this they're saying the pie is going to be bigger

1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:42.780
 your take rate of the pie is going to be smaller but somehow it's going to be more

1:18:42.780 --> 1:18:47.020
 than on the other one that most people on most days are not actually going to

1:18:47.020 --> 1:18:53.900
 successfully manage to monetize a PFP anyway so my sense it's an economic sense not a legal sense

1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:59.500
 is this is where we are in PFPs and now a collection comes out you can't do anything

1:18:59.500 --> 1:19:03.740
 you have to wait for the centralized company to do all the work of promoting it driving

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:12.060
 attention etc i think is going to be uncompetitive for a new pfp collection now if marvel comes and

1:19:12.060 --> 1:19:17.340
 sells you PFPs right and spider-man and four and what have you that might be different right because

1:19:17.340 --> 1:19:21.660
 those are while established brands are ready but for a new brand that needs to be established my

1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:28.300
 guess is is when we're in the latter two categories now any thoughts there are we on yeah can i add

1:19:28.300 --> 1:19:34.380
 something yeah just  i see one of the issues that i would see in that in that model is that

1:19:34.380 --> 1:19:38.860
 let's say you have something on the public domain like uh you know i don't know maybe a member and

1:19:38.860 --> 1:19:43.900
 someone else starts using it who's not the token holder and then they end up making it into a really

1:19:43.900 --> 1:19:49.340
 large brand to a point that it becomes a using in commerce that could be trademarked and then they

1:19:49.340 --> 1:19:55.020
 later on trademark that specific Moonbird as their trademark and then you still have that token so

1:19:55.020 --> 1:20:02.780
 like and again this is on the waters but wouldn't what would be your opinion as to someone else kind

1:20:02.780 --> 1:20:09.660
 of monetizing that potentially for in perpetuity until they choose not to and there's really no

1:20:09.660 --> 1:20:14.060
 what will be the value for the holder at that point if any at all when someone else is kind

1:20:14.060 --> 1:20:19.820
 of claiming cop trademark not copyright but trademark rights or that Moonbird that was initially

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:25.900
 in this in the public domain um that that would be a concern of mine but what would you do in that

1:20:25.900 --> 1:20:31.260
 case now i think that's a very interesting topic i think these topics you know you've seen this with

1:20:31.260 --> 1:20:37.020
 some open source projects where the project itself is released under an MIT license or something

1:20:37.020 --> 1:20:43.180
 but the trademark is still centrally held right where and there's some type of process for

1:20:46.140 --> 1:20:50.940
 applying to use the trademark i think is a complicated one and it's a very good point

1:20:50.940 --> 1:20:57.020
 i don't think there's a straightforward answer yeah those are one of the issues i see yeah

1:20:57.020 --> 1:21:02.780
 all right let's see two more examples and i think then we can go to questions and i'm seeing a ton

1:21:02.780 --> 1:21:07.820
 of questions coming through the chat we need to give people a chance to get their questions answered

1:21:08.780 --> 1:21:19.420
 so in the one of one world this photo here from Gatsomart was i think the most seminal part of

1:21:19.420 --> 1:21:23.500
 thinking about cc0 in the one of one world it's a great story she was an established

1:21:23.500 --> 1:21:31.100
 photographer pre-nfts and this was one of her most famous images and it was constantly stolen

1:21:31.820 --> 1:21:38.540
 right she'd see it on travel blogs and Instagram accounts and people used them on their advertisements

1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:43.020
 never credited her never paid her and this is nothing new than fts right in the off-chain world

1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:50.140
 and then she said well let me take a different approach and said well i'm going to auction it

1:21:50.140 --> 1:21:56.300
 off and i think she had a reserve price of a hundred or something and as soon as it's bought

1:21:57.260 --> 1:22:01.980
 it's going to convert to a public domain license now not strictly speaking of cc0 in her case

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:07.580
 she kept some provisions on hate speech i think and acceptable use in her license but effectively

1:22:07.580 --> 1:22:16.700
 a public domain license and g money was a big collector bought it and this was a very um interesting

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:23.900
 event because i suspect she monetized this piece more without underneath and her whole prior off-chain

1:22:23.900 --> 1:22:29.980
 history of that piece and now it is of course continued to be used by many other people and

1:22:31.020 --> 1:22:34.940
 but now she feels okay about it because she might not and i think she money feels okay about it

1:22:34.940 --> 1:22:39.980
 because it becomes a very it's become a very well-known piece of photography because a lot of

1:22:39.980 --> 1:22:45.100
 people now make derivatives of it and it was interesting because somehow and i'm not saying

1:22:45.100 --> 1:22:49.260
 this applies to most people in most photography right doesn't mean that if you put your image in

1:22:49.260 --> 1:22:53.260
 the public domain you're going to get a hundred each that supply and demand doesn't work that way

1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:58.460
 but if you're a famous photographer and have a famous image it didn't work out this way and i

1:22:58.460 --> 1:23:05.180
 thought this was a very interesting and creative approach indifferent than the type of dynamics

1:23:05.180 --> 1:23:11.420
 that exist in pfps right nothing about this was g money paid a hundred each because he wants to

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:18.460
 make t-shirts with this picture he wants this picture from an art perspective in the same way

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:25.260
 that he would buy any other one of one piece but believes that the whole overall system around

1:23:25.260 --> 1:23:31.500
 this photograph is going to drive attention over time and therefore value so i thought this was

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:38.780
 very interesting a semi-controversial last last fall 2021 and i think now it's been established

1:23:38.780 --> 1:23:44.140
 that like you know some photographers release some pieces of the public domain and i'm not saying

1:23:44.140 --> 1:23:50.460
 it's right or wrong it's just a tool right most release them not under a cc0 license and that's

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:57.500
 fine but i think it is a tool that artists have that they can think about and use creatively right

1:23:57.500 --> 1:24:09.500
 and not just in a pfp context and let's see one more slide on this which is x copy the x copy is

1:24:09.500 --> 1:24:19.980
 very interesting because he is not just a leading crypto artist he's on most metrics among the very

1:24:19.980 --> 1:24:26.220
 very top right and when he started and how many pieces of work he's made and what the prices of

1:24:26.220 --> 1:24:32.780
 his art he's on a quantitative basis at the very very top i think he's amazing but that's just a

1:24:32.780 --> 1:24:43.420
 personal view i say quantitative he's at the very very top and he has a large collection of work

1:24:45.260 --> 1:24:50.380
 and then one day the summer he put all of it in the public domain and what's very interesting and

1:24:50.380 --> 1:24:54.220
 this has to do with how crypto native he is and therefore also how crypto native his collectors

1:24:54.220 --> 1:24:58.860
 are nobody complained and it's very interesting because this is different than the Moonbird's

1:24:58.860 --> 1:25:03.180
 discussion right moon bird said i'm going to give you commercial rights and then change

1:25:03.180 --> 1:25:07.340
 which they're mine and said i actually want to put in the public domain and some people got

1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:11.420
 annoyed but i understand that right because if you bought it because i want to have commercial

1:25:11.420 --> 1:25:16.060
 rights and now i don't have commercial rights with x copy you never had any rights right you had a

1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:23.500
 purse it was just normal art so you just had a personal license to use it you know i own summer

1:25:23.500 --> 1:25:28.220
 dot jpeg but i couldn't do anything with summer dot jpeg i just could look at it really nice to

1:25:28.220 --> 1:25:34.300
 look at and then the rights were still an Xcopy and he said okay well i don't want to hold them

1:25:34.300 --> 1:25:38.140
 anymore i'm going to give them to the world at large interestingly i think the vast majority

1:25:38.140 --> 1:25:43.820
 of his collectors you're just positive not a negative right now i see derivatives of summer

1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:52.780
 dot jpeg everywhere and i think it's great and i appreciate the point that you say well what

1:25:52.780 --> 1:25:58.780
 if people use it i mean what people say online is well what if nazis start using your art right

1:25:58.780 --> 1:26:06.460
 like it's very common thing and i appreciate that in the fullness of time this will happen to some

1:26:06.460 --> 1:26:11.740
 person and some collector and some artist but on the whole the kind of my first reaction to it you

1:26:11.740 --> 1:26:18.780
 know most of human art histories in the public domain and nazis aren't going around using like

1:26:18.780 --> 1:26:27.820
 Renoir's and Van Gogh's and Jane Austen i mean i don't think of nazis as being that art oriented

1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:31.980
 to be totally honest they seem to be more busy doing more obnoxious things than like making

1:26:31.980 --> 1:26:38.620
 derivatives of important art right so it's an issue but historically when we have data on what

1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:43.660
 happens when art is in the public domain and how many times it's used for evil and you know generally

1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:50.780
 the answer is it's not right it has not typically happened with historical art and so i thought these

1:26:50.780 --> 1:26:56.860
 were interesting in that it's a very different discussion than the pfp licensing discussion

1:26:56.860 --> 1:27:02.860
 where the PFP license of discussion is realistically mostly not about the art right nobody's buying

1:27:02.860 --> 1:27:07.980
 most PFP collections because they think oh it's grail art they're buying the collections because

1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:15.260
 they believe or hope a community can emerge around them and drive value and so in that context the

1:27:15.260 --> 1:27:20.300
 licensing discussion is very tactically driven to what's going to encourage people to invest in

1:27:20.300 --> 1:27:27.420
 the pieces whereas what we saw with cats and what we're seeing here with x copy is yes also cc0 but

1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:36.060
 i think cc0 with a different mental model and framework any thoughts on this no i mean i like

1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:43.980
 his art too so okay well with that we ran i think i don't i don't want to say we ran over we did an

1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:48.060
 hour and a half and i think that that's what we needed to do this presentation if we had tried

1:27:48.060 --> 1:27:55.660
 to do it an hour i don't think we could have done it so my suggestion is to be i have on my screen

1:27:55.660 --> 1:27:59.820
 open the questions so i'm going to read the questions and i'm going to let you answer them

1:27:59.820 --> 1:28:05.260
 um because we have an expert from the uspto here i mean we need to take advantage of this

1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:11.500
 i love this one this is great how can fedenza be trademarked when there is a town in a really

1:28:11.500 --> 1:28:17.980
 called Fidenza how does the law work in that case um yeah so that's a great question so it would have

1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:24.060
 to be geographically descriptive and because there's likely no connection or nexus for the

1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:31.580
 actual trademark person or Tyler Hobbs in this case um with the actual Fidenza in Italy it would

1:28:31.580 --> 1:28:35.740
 not be descriptive of that specific place so there will have to be a nexus and evidence that

1:28:35.740 --> 1:28:39.980
 the trademark is being used geographically descriptive in a geographically descriptive

1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:46.220
 manner that the standard used um so fedenza so it's basically it's similar to kind of

1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:54.060
 uh trademarking like a town that's very rural and remote for um computers what would be the nexus

1:28:54.060 --> 1:28:58.860
 there so similarly that's that the way the trademark office would kind of read that um and

1:28:58.860 --> 1:29:05.180
 they will have to find evidence that is geographically descriptive in that sense so this comes down

1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:09.180
 to the issue of classes right you don't just get a trademark for everything you have to get a

1:29:09.180 --> 1:29:16.940
 trademark for something specific and fedenza the town is probably not making an if generative art

1:29:16.940 --> 1:29:22.220
 NFTs and so there's no overlap there right is that yeah what do you think about it I think they

1:29:22.220 --> 1:29:26.700
 yeah but they're also the easiest way to kind of understand trademarks is the likelihood of

1:29:26.700 --> 1:29:31.340
 confusion and that that's kind of what trademark says is to prevent consumer confusion in the

1:29:31.340 --> 1:29:37.580
 marketplace in the in commerce so um someone basically the the easiest way to understand is

1:29:37.580 --> 1:29:43.420
 if you see Fidenza an NFT are you going to associate Fidenza the town in Italy or are you

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:47.820
 going to just refer okay if somebody tells you hey did you buy that Fidenza you're not gonna

1:29:47.820 --> 1:29:52.540
 associate it with that Italy town you're gonna associate it with the NFT art right so that's

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:57.980
 that's the indicator kind of purpose of trademarks and that wouldn't be geographically

1:29:57.980 --> 1:30:03.180
 descriptive in that sense so it just is intended to prevent thesumer confusion and I don't know

1:30:03.180 --> 1:30:08.620
 that Fidenza as the town will create any kind of like confusion and the consumers find that it's

1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:16.540
 related to the actual town in Italy yep makes perfect sense okay next question how just would

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:26.460
 like to confirm that AI works at the moment are not protected under copyright law so no it's not

1:30:26.460 --> 1:30:33.820
 tough it's just there's it's linguistic it's so basically creating a work of art with AI

1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:41.020
 and you name the author of the AI system so the author is not you as a human

1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:48.060
 inputting some code some kind of basic layers into the system or a blender and then the output

1:30:48.060 --> 1:30:54.780
 is you the owner but you're naming the author the actual machine that created this work so

1:30:54.780 --> 1:31:01.660
 that's different than saying I used photoshop or I used blender or dally to create this specific

1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:07.900
 work of art so during the examination process to get registration and we've seen this being

1:31:07.900 --> 1:31:13.820
 posted on Twitter lately they are they asking you questions they're going to ask you how did you

1:31:13.820 --> 1:31:19.260
 use the system what did you input into the system and that's how you're going to determine this was

1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:24.460
 mostly in again there's no clear line as to what they're using to determine what enough

1:31:24.460 --> 1:31:30.780
 input for my human being is as opposed to just machine-made um so that that's the difference

1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:36.860
 is I'm naming the author the machine as opposed to naming me as the author in the creation output

1:31:36.860 --> 1:31:42.860
 and it's me owning that output um ownership that that was created with the machine does that make

1:31:42.860 --> 1:31:51.180
 sense I hope that that's clear it's it could be confusing right my takeaway is how you presented

1:31:51.180 --> 1:31:56.540
 might also make a difference right if you go like that case that you mentioned say hey the AI did it

1:31:56.540 --> 1:32:01.740
 registered on the AI you're gonna get a no right if you're gonna say yeah I did this but I used some

1:32:01.740 --> 1:32:08.380
 tools to help me you might get a yes is that accurate yes yeah it does but it'll in in that

1:32:08.380 --> 1:32:14.460
 process they're going to ask you how much of you how much input from the human being was there

1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:19.740
 basically in using that that machine but yes essentially that's how you present it it's going

1:32:19.740 --> 1:32:24.940
 to make a difference um and that there was an article recently on the uh I think it was a comic

1:32:24.940 --> 1:32:31.180
 strip or a comic book that received a registration using a specific AI system they named themselves

1:32:31.180 --> 1:32:37.180
 the human being as the author but they also specified they use midnight uh journey as the

1:32:37.180 --> 1:32:41.020
 system that they utilize and during the process of dissemination they probably were asked how

1:32:41.020 --> 1:32:47.100
 much input they they put the into midnight in order to receive that output so that's how

1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:56.300
 they receive that cover registration got it okay next question are all these topics considered

1:32:56.300 --> 1:33:01.260
 similar across all jurisdictions do we need to register a trademark across all jurisdictions

1:33:02.620 --> 1:33:08.860
 so when you have a for trademarks you will get a federal registration so that federal

1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:13.660
 registration is basically saying you have users in commerce across the state

1:33:13.660 --> 1:33:19.580
 and um that gives you like a federal kind of protection and you don't have to register in a

1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:25.020
 specific jurisdiction so like a state if that I'm not sure if they're asking international or

1:33:25.900 --> 1:33:30.860
 national so within the US but within the US you could register it you know with each state but

1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:35.820
 that's only going to protect you geographically in that area that that geographic area that you're

1:33:35.820 --> 1:33:41.340
 kind of uh trademarking it so if I were to register in Florida for example you know that

1:33:41.340 --> 1:33:45.180
 will give me protection in Florida and that would be with a trademark office in the floor

1:33:45.180 --> 1:33:49.820
 like they each state has its own trademark process but if you file with the USPTO then

1:33:49.820 --> 1:33:53.980
 you're getting a federal registration and that will give you a nationwide protection

1:33:55.020 --> 1:33:59.260
 and if you wanted international protection though you'd have to file in other countries too right

1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:05.180
 you yeah and there's also a system called the Madrid system that allows you to apply it's to

1:34:05.180 --> 1:34:10.380
 have one one specific application that allows you to have protection different jurisdictions

1:34:10.380 --> 1:34:15.340
 it's a little bit of a complex system so I won't get into details but you would basically it would

1:34:15.340 --> 1:34:20.860
 be more financially uh easier to go through that process than having to go through each country

1:34:20.860 --> 1:34:25.980
 because then you'll have to have an attorney in most countries and the USPTO requires that um

1:34:25.980 --> 1:34:29.900
 you know if you're applying from abroad that you have representation in the US

1:34:32.780 --> 1:34:37.020
 okay this is the part I think you're saying this is where you get a lawyer

1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:44.060
 I have to explain all these things to you yeah it could be it could be complex it could be complex

1:34:46.060 --> 1:34:52.940
 okay the question says that last week 6529 tonight mentioned that most NFTs are not unblocked chains

1:34:52.940 --> 1:34:58.620
 they're simple pointers what I think this question is most of the art is not on chain it's

1:34:58.620 --> 1:35:09.820
 on ipfs or our wave our server does this create any fragility from a legal point of view um I think

1:35:10.540 --> 1:35:17.900
 two things uh first I think we have aws holds the terms of use I think there's more fragility

1:35:17.900 --> 1:35:23.260
 in that sense because you're basically letting a third party host whatever rights you get in that

1:35:23.260 --> 1:35:29.740
 token in a third-party website in the best-case scenario they'll have that also in ipfs but um

1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:34.380
 fragility from a legal standpoint no I think more from a technical standpoint I think that you

1:35:34.380 --> 1:35:38.940
 the blockchain is always going to dictate you know who has ownership but the pointers whether

1:35:38.940 --> 1:35:43.980
 that pointer works or not I think it's just creates more of a centralization because someone's

1:35:43.980 --> 1:35:49.820
 going to have to pay for that ipfs so if we're kind of to if we want to emphasize or kind of push

1:35:49.820 --> 1:35:55.180
 towards that decentralization you're kind of going against the grain if you have someone

1:35:55.180 --> 1:36:00.380
 having to pay for that ipfs to continue hosting that so I think that's why some NFT projects

1:36:00.380 --> 1:36:05.660
 are moving towards having on chain art and moving the arts on chain so that there's no actual

1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:11.820
 fragility in that sense and our way was a little bit better you pay upfront rather than

1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:18.460
 continuously having to pay that's a simple way to describe it but from a copyright perspective

1:36:18.460 --> 1:36:22.300
 it shouldn't make a difference right like where it's hosted no not really it no

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:27.980
 it's kind of like when you buy a painting and you keep it in a museum you know it just depends

1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:31.980
 on which museum you choose and just if you still own the copyright regardless of where

1:36:31.980 --> 1:36:39.500
 that that's sitting okay that makes sense this one I'm going to take it says have I deemed

1:36:39.500 --> 1:36:45.900
 my cryptopunk 6529 is cc0 and the answer is of course no because the further answer is

1:36:45.900 --> 1:36:53.580
 I'm not allowed to that's not my decision to make that's a decision that Yuga Labs was to have to make

1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:57.820
 if they were ever to make that decision I don't think they will but like in any case

1:36:57.820 --> 1:37:05.500
 they would be the ones to make that decision I am in effect a licensee of Yuga Labs as it relates

1:37:05.500 --> 1:37:11.500
 to 6529 there's a license agreement that I have to follow what we mentioned earlier

1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:19.100
 and that license agreement wouldn't allow me to on behalf of you to declare that my

1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:23.500
 punk is now in the public domain right that's a you get a decision not a me decision this is

1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:29.500
 correct is this correct yeah and the way the easiest way to understand is you can give what you

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:35.340
 didn't get yourself so you can give more than you received so you receive an exclusive license you

1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:40.380
 can give an assignment at that point so you can it's kind of like a funnel you can give more than

1:37:40.380 --> 1:37:53.500
 you received okay here is a semi-technical question I think I don't think it's hard but let me see

1:37:54.060 --> 1:38:02.700
 is there ever only one copy of artwork associated with NFT an example they use is IPFS that multiple

1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:08.620
 copies may exist on each computer that's pinning it which one's the true version and does that even

1:38:08.620 --> 1:38:17.500
 matter in any way no it doesn't matter and the way I see it is when the creator and I'm going to

1:38:17.500 --> 1:38:22.140
 give an example so let's say you hire someone to make a piece of art for you the moment they created

1:38:22.140 --> 1:38:27.180
 that piece of art and put it in tangible form that's the that's the original basically so anything

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:33.260
 else and again this is untested water so this is just an opinion it will be in maybe some different

1:38:33.260 --> 1:38:38.860
 practitioners think differently but once you put an IPFS that's a copy of that so you know you have

1:38:38.860 --> 1:38:44.140
 ownership over the copyright but that's just basically a display of it or maybe a copy or a

1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:50.620
 display of the actual copyright that you have ownership over but the moment that was put into

1:38:50.620 --> 1:38:55.500
 tangible form that would be the original and doesn't really kind of make any difference

1:38:55.500 --> 1:39:02.700
 because it's just the way that it is displayed so you could display it on IPFS or aws or we

1:39:02.700 --> 1:39:07.740
 it is the way that it's being displayed in multiple nodes host those things so that's

1:39:07.740 --> 1:39:14.060
 what you're referring to um it would just your copyright would not be affected by that

1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:23.900
 yep that makes perfect sense another fidenza question if I sell a Fidenza my Fidenza I wish

1:39:23.900 --> 1:39:27.100
 I don't know if it's a person who means they wish they have a Fidenza or they wish they could sell

1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:36.220
 a Fidenza uh what happens to the physical printed artwork that I also bought of my piece

1:39:36.220 --> 1:39:42.140
 does the new owner have the right to also print the same piece are they open editions or one of

1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:52.700
 ones and I'll just add here I think Tyler does I think just print for the first person who asks

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:59.580
 regardless of the token but how do we think about this from a copyright perspective um I think the

1:39:59.580 --> 1:40:05.980
 copyright holder dictates those rights so we will have to go to Tyler Hobbs and those terms he

1:40:05.980 --> 1:40:12.540
 and he does he prints it for I think the first few um the first I think the first holder

1:40:12.540 --> 1:40:17.500
 and if you go to his website it says like which ones are available and which ones are not um but I

1:40:17.500 --> 1:40:23.020
 would I would say that that's depending on him and I know he's mentioned in the past he's he's

1:40:23.020 --> 1:40:26.780
 written articles I don't know if any of you've seen this but he wrote an article about why he

1:40:26.780 --> 1:40:33.500
 didn't want to have cc zero as um in his work of art he actually wore what he wanted to keep a

1:40:33.500 --> 1:40:40.620
 non-exclusive license and why that the reason why he kind of leaned towards that but um I would lean

1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:45.260
 towards this read the terms of Tyler Hobbs and each one of the Fidenzas in each one of his works

1:40:45.260 --> 1:40:53.660
 um before we uh determined that right and so this is a good example of Fidenzas are

1:40:53.660 --> 1:41:00.380
 released under a traditional license right they're not a commercial or cc zero and the copyright

1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:08.780
 is owned by Tyler and that copyright can be expressed in um the NFT art that's on Shane

1:41:08.780 --> 1:41:13.820
 in the case of Fidenzas but also a print and because Tyler is in charge whatever the rules

1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:18.780
 are on printing fidenzas Tyler gets to decide and Tyler could also decide to change the rules

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:23.500
 right tomorrow he could say that everyone that has a Fidenza could ask for a print if they want

1:41:23.500 --> 1:41:28.300
 I mean he might not want to do that but if you wanted to he could right yeah those are copies

1:41:28.300 --> 1:41:32.620
 those would be considered copies of the copyright and he would continue to be the owner and

1:41:32.620 --> 1:41:37.660
 he does not mention anything against cc zero he said just not every project is intended to be

1:41:37.660 --> 1:41:46.220
 nz zero and I agree I think they're you know each model is applicable to each project differently

1:41:46.220 --> 1:41:53.420
 okay we have a question here about virtual clothing that says trademark of trademark of

1:41:53.420 --> 1:41:59.500
 clothing is a complicated matter one cannot trademark a plain blue shirt but the logo on it

1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:05.340
 can we expect that virtual clothing given that the underlying code is unique will be applicable

1:42:05.340 --> 1:42:13.580
 to trademark eg will we be able to trademark a plain blue shirt so it would have to indicate

1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:19.900
 source so the plain blue shirt is not indicating a source that would not function as a trademark

1:42:19.900 --> 1:42:24.060
 but what you're asking is that it's hard to trade and I don't know if they're confusing

1:42:24.060 --> 1:42:29.900
 copyrights and trademarks I think you might be a little bit of a confusion there but if it's just

1:42:29.900 --> 1:42:35.660
 the blue shirt that's indicating the source as this source of the remaining goods that you have then

1:42:35.660 --> 1:42:41.180
 I would apply for a class nine which is a non-domotable digital asset that points to the blue shirts

1:42:41.180 --> 1:42:48.620
 that you're selling that would be what you basically have to trademark and that's that that

1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:54.620
 blue shirt you could actually have a trade dress which is like kind of the pack that could be potentially

1:42:54.620 --> 1:43:00.140
 even packaging so like the coca-cola bottle has a trademark on the trade dress so like the way

1:43:00.140 --> 1:43:05.420
 the coca-cola bottle looks so that's what you're referring to and you could have multiple ways of

1:43:05.420 --> 1:43:11.500
 kind of protecting that blue shirt that you're referring to okay and I think you're right it

1:43:11.500 --> 1:43:17.660
 might be unclear if this is a trademark or a copyright question okay with regards to the

1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:24.940
 can't-be-evil license what's the licenses development and acceptance trajectory and how are high

1:43:24.940 --> 1:43:31.660
 potential stakeholders responding to it I think for the benefit of the audience the can't-be-evil

1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:39.980
 license is a sample NFT commercial license that Andreessen Horowitz developed on their own

1:43:39.980 --> 1:43:47.980
 I had they had asked me for some feedback that I gave it was an Andreessen Horowitz project that

1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:52.460
 then they released to the world and said we think this is a good commercial license and feel free

1:43:52.460 --> 1:43:56.940
 to use it what are your views on the license have you seen people adopting it you have any

1:43:56.940 --> 1:44:07.580
 perspective on this um I'll say this I think everyone it's going to I don't like templates

1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:12.140
 personally just because I think templates kind of uh you're adopting someone else's thought

1:44:12.140 --> 1:44:18.940
 process basically on what they intended to give um but I think it's a good framework for you to

1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:23.340
 think about okay like do I want this and you could slice and dice however you want so like you

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:28.300
 as a copyright holder you get to have all the bundle of rights that we mentioned earlier at the

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:34.620
 beginning and you could slice them and dice them however you want so you could give anyone the right

1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:39.260
 to for going back to the analogy of the house you could get someone the right to enter your kitchen

1:44:39.260 --> 1:44:45.340
 or only enter your bathroom so it's you you have the say on how much you want to give and what the

1:44:45.340 --> 1:44:51.340
 scope of that is um so for those I think this is a good starting point I really think they did a

1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:56.860
 great job of kind of like addressing some of the issues in this space but I think you need to read

1:44:56.860 --> 1:45:01.420
 those through Lindsay how applicable they are to what you're intending to grant and what you're

1:45:01.420 --> 1:45:08.620
 intending to keep control over yeah this makes sense it's how I think about it too I mean you have

1:45:09.340 --> 1:45:14.380
 it's a very interesting template to look at there are no creative common templates look like I mean

1:45:14.380 --> 1:45:19.260
 honestly I think the cryptopunks license is quite good in that dimension that's another area to look

1:45:19.260 --> 1:45:26.060
 at and I don't know that any major projects are taking these directly copy-pasting and not making

1:45:26.060 --> 1:45:30.700
 any changes but in a way it doesn't matter right like if there are good ideas and people put them out

1:45:30.700 --> 1:45:41.820
 there um it'll help the space move forward yeah yeah oh good let's take maybe a couple more questions

1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:47.420
 and then I mean I thank you we've taken up a lot of your time now we're heading towards two hours so

1:45:48.300 --> 1:45:54.700
 I do want to bring it to an end at some point so let's do a couple more questions and then wrap

1:45:54.700 --> 1:46:01.260
 this up this is blockchain is borderless which it is or is crypto assets public watch answer borderless

1:46:03.420 --> 1:46:07.180
 how do you think about I'm going to rephrase the question a little bit but how do you think about

1:46:08.220 --> 1:46:15.020
 copyright and licensing across a variety of foreign countries

1:46:17.260 --> 1:46:23.980
 um so that's an interesting question because as far as copyright goes um there's no such thing

1:46:23.980 --> 1:46:30.860
 as international copyright so each country has its own regime that protects authors um and they're not

1:46:30.860 --> 1:46:36.300
 extraterritorial so um that does so that our US copyright does not protect against copying outside

1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:41.580
 of the US works by American authors but we do have some treaties so in specific jurisdictions that

1:46:41.580 --> 1:46:49.180
 have signed on so treaties like the burn convention um and that basically you and this is a very

1:46:49.180 --> 1:46:54.300
 complicated area so I don't want to get too deep into it but if an American author for example is

1:46:54.300 --> 1:46:59.180
 in French, in France they will have a member of the treaty party they will have the same

1:46:59.180 --> 1:47:05.340
 rights as a French author would have um but again there's more to it than that so it just

1:47:06.220 --> 1:47:12.300
 might might take on it is um we've been fighting over international rights and some kind of a

1:47:13.260 --> 1:47:18.700
 kind of across the board kind of standardization for a long time I doubt we're going to get to

1:47:18.700 --> 1:47:23.900
 a place where everyone's of the same regime um but there are some treaties that allow us to

1:47:23.900 --> 1:47:28.220
 have some rights that are similar to or that will have the same treatment if you were in that

1:47:28.220 --> 1:47:38.700
 jurisdiction um and a specific person from that jurisdiction so the short answer is it's complicated

1:47:38.700 --> 1:47:43.100
 possibly more complicated the internet might be even more complicated than international

1:47:43.100 --> 1:47:51.020
 trademarks less standardized than trademarks are maybe yeah I would say so um it does like

1:47:51.020 --> 1:47:55.980
 there's section 104 which potentially protects like unpolished works so like there's there's a

1:47:55.980 --> 1:48:03.020
 different like a kind of nuances to international space that could be very complex but for

1:48:03.020 --> 1:48:09.580
 the most part just know that if you are part of a treaty that the US is of such as the burn

1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:14.540
 convention you likely have some rights in that jurisdiction that's also part of that same treaty

1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:20.060
 and they could be very similar and I don't want to speak in generalizations but yeah they tend

1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:26.620
 to be very similar not to generalize okay last question this is a funny one uh

1:48:27.820 --> 1:48:35.180
 crypto punks versus crypto funks look exactly like the exact same PFP just mirror image

1:48:35.180 --> 1:48:43.980
 which any copyright issues there until someone brings the lawsuit then I'll refrain from that

1:48:43.980 --> 1:48:49.900
 conversation because I know he tried to be mca but um I think it's just depends on who wants to

1:48:49.900 --> 1:48:56.380
 litigate that okay right so that would be a specific that have to be a specific lawsuit

1:48:56.380 --> 1:49:04.460
 on a specific topic and then we'd discover I assume the crypto funks would make some type of

1:49:04.460 --> 1:49:13.820
 fair use commentary type argument and if you go wanted to pursue them they would say it's

1:49:13.820 --> 1:49:22.780
 not that you're commercially using my copyright but so far this in the broad crypto punks versus

1:49:22.780 --> 1:49:29.260
 crypto funk sense has not gone to court and so the reality is we don't know until it happens

1:49:29.260 --> 1:49:34.780
 with a specific set of facts and specific set of arguments about how a court would decide right yeah and

1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:38.780
 I say that also because they could bring into question the copyrightability of the crypto

1:49:38.780 --> 1:49:44.460
 punks so that's why it's it's more than just hey are they similar it's a little bit more complex

1:49:44.460 --> 1:49:49.740
 because someone could bring into question like is that even a copyrightable um subject matter

1:49:49.740 --> 1:49:56.620
 because they're so they were created by AI or and I know Professor Brian Brian Fry has an

1:49:56.620 --> 1:50:00.860
 article on the copyrightability of crypto punks so that's why I think there's a lot of things that

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:08.700
 could come into question if that also comes about in a litigation right so because in a way that

1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:14.700
 we're not in a way I mean the crypto punks like a lot of general projects a lot of pfp projects

1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:20.540
 are generative right you didn't know what streets we're going to get and so what you're saying is

1:50:20.540 --> 1:50:28.140
 is for there to be a lawsuit here you go would have to bring it right and if you're

1:50:28.780 --> 1:50:36.460
 brought the copyright holder would have to bring it right yes um and that's because they gave exclusive

1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:41.820
 rights to so like when you give exclusive rights normally and then this is how it's enforced normally

1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:46.860
 when you give exclusive rights you give the person who gets that exclusivity the right to sue as well

1:50:46.860 --> 1:50:53.500
 because it's exclusive to you you're basically taking my place as the creator in a way legally speaking

1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:56.780
 so um the holder would have to bring that so if you're somebody's in front of your

1:50:56.780 --> 1:51:01.420
 punk you could potentially bring that but then they might come back in the defense and say well

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:06.620
 you don't have something that is not even uh copyrightable because it was created by AI so

1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:12.060
 therefore there's no actual creation of that's allowed to be copyrighted in the first

1:51:12.060 --> 1:51:17.340
 place wow and you have a registration and you have to have a registration in order for you to

1:51:17.340 --> 1:51:21.260
 bring that into law so even in the first place you also have to have the registration

1:51:21.260 --> 1:51:24.860
 which you could potentially have and I think they do mention that in the terms of use you could bring

1:51:24.860 --> 1:51:32.380
 that um you could actually register um the uh your asset and I think they mentioned

1:51:32.380 --> 1:51:38.380
 that briefly in the terms of use amazing but you have yeah they explain how you want they want they

1:51:38.380 --> 1:51:43.260
 want to keep some kind of control over it over the registration as I think they want to be named as

1:51:43.260 --> 1:51:49.180
 the owner and you could be uh or the author I can't recall but it's in the terms of use that

1:51:49.180 --> 1:51:56.940
 whether you could register wow this is where this stuff is super interesting and super complicated but

1:51:56.940 --> 1:52:05.420
 I mean just utterly fascinating we are here on the frontier I think of IP and technology and networks

1:52:05.420 --> 1:52:13.980
 I think we need to say an utterly gigantic thank you to Ellie for today she a presentation was

1:52:14.780 --> 1:52:20.940
 hers she put it together I just put in the pretty pictures that was my contribution was like I copy

1:52:20.940 --> 1:52:26.620
 pasted some pictures in there all of this was Ellie it's obvious she knows everything inside out

1:52:26.620 --> 1:52:33.580
 and backward I very much appreciate the time she gave us so everyone please give her a virtual

1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:42.300
 round of applause and thank you so much thank you I think you did a lot more than that so thank you

1:52:42.300 --> 1:53:02.540
 all right um I think the studio team you can take us off now
