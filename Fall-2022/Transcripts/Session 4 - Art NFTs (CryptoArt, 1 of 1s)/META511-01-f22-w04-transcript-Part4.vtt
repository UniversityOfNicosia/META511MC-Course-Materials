WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:22.800
All right.

00:22.800 --> 00:25.000
Hey, GM, GM, everybody.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.980
Thank you for joining us and welcome to Meta 511, an NFT

00:28.980 --> 00:33.520
panel discussion on crypto art and one of ones.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.960
A huge thank you to our host, Yoonik, for including the session

00:36.960 --> 00:39.120
in their ongoing series on web 3.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.040
I'm pleased to be joined by Sasha Styles, Claire Silver, Ina

00:43.040 --> 00:45.080
Moja, and Sam Strad.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.240
But before we get started, OK, there's a bit of lag here,

00:51.240 --> 00:55.200
but we're going to try laboring on.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.520
So first of all, a reminder.

01:00.520 --> 01:01.520
OK.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.000
All right, let's give this a shot again.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.240
So reminder, if you're attending,

01:07.240 --> 01:10.000
you can ask questions in the on chat or on Twitter

01:10.000 --> 01:15.120
using hashtag NFT Q&A. So the topic of today

01:15.120 --> 01:18.600
is really around crypto art and one of ones.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.840
And why is this topic important?

01:20.840 --> 01:23.120
And one of ones are the NFT equivalent

01:23.120 --> 01:25.400
of a unique painting or photograph.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.240
They're usually owned by a single individual.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.440
Placing of one of one with a notable collector

01:30.440 --> 01:32.920
institution or fund in the NFT world

01:32.920 --> 01:34.680
is as important as it is with works

01:34.680 --> 01:36.240
in the traditional art world.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.320
So provenance and provability often

01:38.320 --> 01:40.760
become a very important aspect.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.880
And especially when you play that to the digital world,

01:43.880 --> 01:46.360
you have provability and you also

01:46.360 --> 01:48.560
have the provable scarcity aspect.

01:48.560 --> 01:50.640
And a classic case in the traditional world

01:50.640 --> 01:54.600
would be the Salva Carmundi by Leonardo da Vinci,

01:54.600 --> 01:58.560
supposedly by Leonardo, which sold as high as $450 million.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.360
But if you look at the initial certification,

02:00.360 --> 02:02.640
it was done by a world-renowned gallery.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.240
But again, it shows you that it is an imprecise art at best.

02:07.240 --> 02:09.400
And that's where the blockchain comes into be.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.680
So I'm very, very happy and thrilled to be here

02:11.680 --> 02:14.960
with four tremendous guests.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.480
Sam Spratt, Sasha Styles, Claire Silver, Inamoja.

02:19.480 --> 02:23.000
And we're going to get into a little bit of the discussion

02:23.000 --> 02:25.480
on why one of one art is relevant.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.320
But before we do that, I'd like each of them

02:27.320 --> 02:30.440
to introduce themselves and maybe spend two to three minutes

02:30.440 --> 02:33.800
kind of introducing a little bit about who they are.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.200
So I'm going to start with Claire.

02:36.200 --> 02:39.320
Claire, why don't you start and kick us off here.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.200
Hey, good morning.

02:40.200 --> 02:43.400
I will do my best to do that.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.080
Hope everybody is having a great day.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.120
I'm Claire Silver.

02:46.120 --> 02:49.040
I'm an AI collaborative artist.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.000
And I do a lot of work with exhibitions

02:53.000 --> 02:56.560
and sort of curating contests for AI art

02:56.560 --> 02:58.520
and hoping people sort of push the boundaries

02:58.520 --> 03:01.840
into other mediums, like film, video games, music, et cetera.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.880
Very exciting time to be working with AI as an artist.

03:05.880 --> 03:07.960
And I'm also a co-founder of A2, which

03:07.960 --> 03:11.160
is a collective for emerging artists

03:11.160 --> 03:12.600
to help get them some visibility.

03:12.600 --> 03:16.280
We did an exhibition of their work at Basel last year

03:16.280 --> 03:17.480
and won in New York as well.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.800
So that's me.

03:19.800 --> 03:20.960
Hey, thanks, Claire.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.800
You know, over to you.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.600
I'm with the one.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.640
I'm Ina Moja.

03:26.640 --> 03:32.160
I'm a visual cook-green, which is a three-for-good organization.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.360
Thanks, Ina.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.720
Sasha, over to you.

03:35.720 --> 03:36.400
Hi.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.000
I'm actually going to break the trend

03:38.000 --> 03:41.120
and put my camera on to say hi to everyone.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.680
Thanks so much for having all of us here.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.320
This is a really wonderful group.

03:44.320 --> 03:47.200
So just by way of a quick introduction,

03:47.200 --> 03:48.600
again, my name is Sasha.

03:48.600 --> 03:52.320
I'm a first-generation, comic, Mongolian-American poet,

03:52.320 --> 03:54.800
an artist, as well as an AI researcher.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.480
And I work mainly at the intersection of text and technology.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.480
I'm a lifelong writer and poet.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.600
And really, my main areas of focus these days

04:01.600 --> 04:03.880
are generative literature and language art,

04:03.880 --> 04:07.000
and, of course, blockchain and poetics.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
I'm particularly interested in the resonances

04:09.000 --> 04:13.800
between poetry and technology and considering poetry as code.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.160
Poetry is a kind of ancient data storage system.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.240
Along with all the conceptual implications

04:19.240 --> 04:22.960
that poetry can bring into this web3 world of digital ownership

04:22.960 --> 04:26.600
and provenance and preservation.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.600
In 2021, I actually published my first book, which

04:30.600 --> 04:32.840
is a collection of hybrid poetry and artwork.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.000
And it's called technology.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.200
And I actually have it right here.

04:36.200 --> 04:40.760
And it's all about what it means to be human in a nearly post-human era.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.680
And I wrote this book with a non-human co-author, an AI-powered

04:44.680 --> 04:50.680
alter-ego, a text generator, rooted in GPT-2 and GPT-3,

04:50.680 --> 04:52.800
just an ancestor of chat GPT, who's

04:52.800 --> 04:55.000
been getting a lot of attention lately.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.200
And I've been working with this text generator

04:57.200 --> 05:00.720
and customizing it since 2018.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.320
I am very grateful to say that technology, my book,

05:04.320 --> 05:06.760
has been praised and welcomed not just by poets,

05:06.760 --> 05:09.440
but also by the tech community and the AI world

05:09.440 --> 05:12.760
and by futurists and visionaries, such as Ray Kurtzpile, which

05:12.760 --> 05:15.440
has really meant a lot to me.

05:15.440 --> 05:21.240
I am very wedded to physical books as a lifelong writer.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.560
Books are very near and dear to me.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.440
But I'm also very interested in publishing innovations,

05:26.440 --> 05:32.200
and especially what web3 promises for writers like myself, not

05:32.200 --> 05:34.720
just artists, but writers and poets.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.360
And I'm very interested in looking

05:36.360 --> 05:41.040
at how I can use blockchain, protocol, and different mediums

05:41.040 --> 05:43.480
to manifest my poetry in different ways.

05:43.480 --> 05:46.400
And I've had a lot of fun over the past few years

05:46.400 --> 05:49.600
getting to publish my poems in various experimental formats

05:49.600 --> 05:54.040
by places like FXHASH and PONTOM and 50 Gateway,

05:54.040 --> 05:54.880
and objects.

05:54.880 --> 05:59.280
And I even sold an AI-powered poem last year at Christie's,

05:59.280 --> 06:02.360
which still is sort of unbelievable to me.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.720
And last but not least, I wanted to just say that I am also

06:04.720 --> 06:07.400
co-founder of a group called Diverseverse, which

06:07.400 --> 06:12.440
is a literary gallery dedicated to crypto poetry and really

06:12.440 --> 06:14.480
NFT literature at large.

06:14.480 --> 06:18.920
We are dedicated to exploring the ideas that poetry is art,

06:18.920 --> 06:22.440
that poetry is also a technology.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.800
And that language really shouldn't have any limits

06:24.800 --> 06:25.640
or any boundaries.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.760
And we've been working on a lot of really exciting projects

06:28.760 --> 06:33.520
that are coming up this year, which I'm excited to share.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.360
Thanks.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.520
Thank you, Sasha.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.760
Sam, last but not least.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.080
Hey, good morning, everyone.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.520
Man, thank you for having us.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.800
This is really special.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.400
Bharat, really good to be with you.

06:45.400 --> 06:49.520
And all three of you are just extremely talented and thoughtful

06:49.520 --> 06:50.600
women.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.840
It's an honor to be alongside you.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.080
I started out as an oil painter.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.840
And I would study the technique of the old master's

07:00.840 --> 07:02.120
feet of horror Rubens.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.840
But around 12 years ago, I discovered

07:04.840 --> 07:06.640
a digital tablet.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.120
And then I pretty much spent the rest of the time from then

07:10.120 --> 07:12.520
until now, trying to figure out how

07:12.520 --> 07:18.520
I take the warmth, the flaws, the attempt of the medium

07:18.520 --> 07:21.600
that I started with, and how to translate it

07:21.600 --> 07:25.640
into this space that we actually use and operate

07:25.640 --> 07:28.080
primarily today.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.560
My early gigs were a staff illustrator for tech blogs.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.960
I was making 20 bucks in illustration.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.840
I transitioned that into a pretty solid career

07:37.840 --> 07:41.680
doing album covers for Kid Cudi, You've Done a Glover,

07:41.680 --> 07:45.680
Logic, working on games like Borderlands and Red Dead

07:45.680 --> 07:47.240
Redemption.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.160
But in that arc, in that 10 years that I

07:51.160 --> 07:57.120
was spent building this, I was creating other people's worlds.

07:57.120 --> 08:02.600
And a few years ago, I had this very fascinating,

08:02.600 --> 08:05.880
but honestly, rather brutal series of events

08:05.880 --> 08:11.000
kind of unseat me, untether me from that process.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.520
I noticed that in creating all of this and stacking

08:14.520 --> 08:18.600
a client list and chasing the commissions from each of them,

08:18.600 --> 08:20.800
that I had become rather abstracted

08:20.800 --> 08:24.480
from the idea of what an artist is supposed to be.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.760
And there is this strange sense of decay

08:29.760 --> 08:34.720
in that of this prior iteration that I had spent and dedicated

08:34.720 --> 08:36.160
my whole life to.

08:36.160 --> 08:40.240
And there was something a few years ago

08:40.240 --> 08:43.920
that in me, I felt I got to make my own world.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.440
I have to say my own thing.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.240
I had lived this path of a mimic, almost,

08:50.240 --> 08:56.520
of being the kind of person or artist I needed to be for every job

08:56.520 --> 08:59.200
or project or artist that came my way.

08:59.200 --> 09:02.800
And something about this space when I started creating

09:02.800 --> 09:09.560
my series, Lucy, felt like, oh my god, everyone else

09:09.560 --> 09:11.800
is doing this too.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.160
They all have their own version of it,

09:13.160 --> 09:14.520
whatever kind of person they are.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.400
It doesn't matter if they're an artist or a collector

09:17.400 --> 09:20.600
or a platform builder or an engineer.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.760
There's a lot of people here who felt that sense of decay.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.040
Like they were missing the growth part of life.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.240
They were in the dissociative part of it.

09:31.240 --> 09:34.400
And Lucy, the series of episodic paintings

09:34.400 --> 09:37.040
that I've created is about that.

09:37.040 --> 09:41.520
It's about taking our first steps again of trying anew.

09:41.520 --> 09:46.720
And within this, I think there's something

09:46.720 --> 09:54.720
about 101 art in particular that I feel

09:54.720 --> 09:58.880
I spent my whole life trying to make covers and facades

09:58.880 --> 10:01.800
and advertisements that would pop off the shelf

10:01.800 --> 10:05.920
to try to grab as many people as possible through their noise.

10:05.920 --> 10:10.280
And in that process, I was very alone, very isolated,

10:10.280 --> 10:11.520
trying to do that.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.720
And here, there's none of that during this year

10:14.720 --> 10:16.000
that I studied this space.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.680
I've just been creating.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.760
We get to kind of just do as we please make what we feel.

10:21.760 --> 10:29.040
And these feelings, no matter how over earnest or melodramatic,

10:29.040 --> 10:32.600
only a single person needs to see it.

10:32.600 --> 10:34.000
That's one of one.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.240
It's person to person.

10:36.240 --> 10:39.240
Only a single individual needs to feel the frequency

10:39.240 --> 10:41.080
that you're on.

10:41.080 --> 10:45.080
From my 10 years of a career, that is such a powerful seismic

10:45.080 --> 10:49.080
shift in how I create and how I deliver art.

10:49.080 --> 10:53.360
Where a 101 piece of art is capable of holding a rather sacred

10:53.360 --> 10:56.880
bond that this individual story and the source of it

10:56.880 --> 11:00.560
can kind of stack or multiply across the ledger

11:00.560 --> 11:04.080
as other people bid on it and gets eventually collected

11:04.080 --> 11:05.720
by another individual.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.520
There's a story right in that.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.360
But it's once that individual thing

11:10.360 --> 11:18.720
has transferred that the soloed-off atomized portion of it

11:18.720 --> 11:20.720
starts becoming collective.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.640
That the collector can kind of breathe new life through it,

11:23.640 --> 11:27.040
evangelize it, spread it, meme it, elevate it in a way,

11:27.040 --> 11:30.200
far beyond the source of its own creation.

11:30.200 --> 11:33.520
Your work starts to collide and curate alongside other artists,

11:33.520 --> 11:35.600
like everyone here on the stage.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.680
The medium starts to blend and overlap.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.200
And yet, we as individuals are still

11:41.200 --> 11:45.800
like codified on chain back to our origin points.

11:45.800 --> 11:47.680
I love that.

11:47.680 --> 11:51.240
I can't really begin to express how powerful that has been

11:51.240 --> 11:54.080
over the last year of creating this project.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.600
That freedom of movement to remove

11:56.600 --> 12:00.600
these increments that separate what I think in the past

12:00.600 --> 12:06.040
maybe seemed disparate elements of humanity.

12:06.040 --> 12:09.360
Just don't feel like that here.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.480
It's a playground to kind of tap into who you are,

12:13.480 --> 12:17.920
but also see what you can become when you start playing together.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.640
It's amazing.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.920
Hey, thanks, Sam.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.120
Hey, I want to stick with you for a second, right?

12:25.120 --> 12:27.880
Could you tell us a little bit more about Lucy's backstory

12:27.880 --> 12:29.800
or the origin story, if you would,

12:29.800 --> 12:33.360
and how alternate reality shaped the body of work?

12:33.360 --> 12:36.480
Maybe give us a little bit more of that sort of parallel universe

12:36.480 --> 12:40.840
as you see it and how that sort of plays a part in your artwork.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.760
Yeah, absolutely.

12:42.760 --> 12:47.880
So Lucy was really born from this catalytic series

12:47.880 --> 12:51.840
of events in my own life that all kind of happened simultaneously

12:51.840 --> 12:53.040
three or four years ago.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.240
This was in depth, some relationships ending

12:57.240 --> 13:00.720
that distasteed my own path as an artist that I mentioned,

13:00.720 --> 13:06.000
that feeling of waking up from a haze of something

13:06.000 --> 13:10.480
that maybe barely rhymes with life,

13:10.480 --> 13:15.200
both in art and itself.

13:15.200 --> 13:19.720
I discussed about as many aspects as you could imagine

13:19.720 --> 13:23.760
in my work, in my actions, in my knowledge, in my appearance.

13:23.760 --> 13:27.480
I was a very sad stack at this point in time,

13:27.480 --> 13:28.800
had a lot of feelings.

13:28.800 --> 13:31.360
But I think I needed that violence.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.720
And as I began regaining my footing,

13:34.720 --> 13:39.120
I was looking for answers and that came in the form of reading

13:39.120 --> 13:43.280
as many great stories and novels as possible.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.480
Seeing how these things connected to each other,

13:45.480 --> 13:49.240
going back in time and starting to see truths in the most recent ones

13:49.240 --> 13:52.600
that were found and older ones that were found in the most ancient ones,

13:52.600 --> 13:55.560
these questions that I'd been asking myself now,

13:55.560 --> 14:00.120
after everything unraveled, were asked and answered like millions of times

14:00.120 --> 14:02.080
over thousands of years.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.840
And so I would be journaling my own wanders, my own lives,

14:05.840 --> 14:11.120
and I would see the same thing happening in books,

14:11.120 --> 14:16.160
rhyming patterns of both my successes, but also my failures.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.200
And the thing that got me stuck in a more dissociative cycle for a while,

14:21.200 --> 14:26.520
that I started to see this space really unlocked to when you put discipline

14:26.520 --> 14:33.440
towards bending your own arc, to taking ownership agency over your own actions,

14:33.440 --> 14:35.600
it starts to pull you out of it.

14:35.600 --> 14:40.800
And Lucy making these paintings,

14:40.800 --> 14:44.560
they are markers.

14:44.560 --> 14:49.280
They're like markers of progress about the discovery of not being alone

14:49.280 --> 14:51.200
as you try to regain your footing.

14:51.200 --> 14:56.640
And I guess just as much so, they're like markers of our narrative of progress,

14:56.640 --> 15:02.120
of the moments and the story that were like right for ourselves,

15:02.120 --> 15:06.720
if I had managed to live my whole life and absolutely miss so many things,

15:06.720 --> 15:10.720
maybe I'm a little bit of a dishonest narrator for myself,

15:10.720 --> 15:17.280
and that it might be rather interesting if reality starts being

15:17.280 --> 15:23.360
others around us reflecting back at us to make something that feels more solid.

15:23.360 --> 15:28.720
And that feeling that I think Lucy came from is what I've witnessed

15:28.720 --> 15:34.720
across pretty much every person I've come to meet and know and even love

15:34.720 --> 15:38.720
and appreciate in this space, like Lucy, each one of these paintings

15:38.720 --> 15:44.120
is like a carefully crafted joke at my own expense.

15:44.120 --> 15:49.320
And they pull from prominent origin, salamat of teachings, modern day New York,

15:49.320 --> 15:55.480
but it's mostly just when you start alone, it's not real.

15:55.480 --> 16:00.680
It only gets real when you start bouncing off everyone else.

16:00.680 --> 16:01.680
I love that Sam.

16:01.680 --> 16:05.000
So art imitating life at its truest sense.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.040
Hey, Claire, let me shift over to you.

16:07.040 --> 16:11.480
You've described yourself as a collaborative AI artist.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.040
Tell us about the impact of AI on your work.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.000
I know you've got a tremendous body of work.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.800
You've been an evangelist for AI art for as long as I can remember,

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
but would love to get your point of view and perspective.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.360
Yeah, totally.

16:25.360 --> 16:31.440
Well, so the impact of AI on my work, gosh, there's a lot.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.720
One of the first things it did was it inspired me with questions

16:34.720 --> 16:37.960
of what it means to be human and what art is.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.560
Those were sort of the first.

16:39.560 --> 16:43.880
And also, this is pretty common knowledge, but I have a chronic illness.

16:43.880 --> 16:50.080
And so thinking about AI solving for some of those issues that humanities had forever,

16:50.080 --> 16:55.280
like chronic illnesses, et cetera, and what we might celebrate when those parts of the

16:55.280 --> 17:00.360
hero's journey are overcome, so to speak, what other things we might find to tell stories

17:00.360 --> 17:03.720
about and celebrate fascinated me.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.440
So I've been able to use AI to explore those questions in a way that I don't think I would

17:07.440 --> 17:11.000
have necessarily been able to do alone.

17:11.000 --> 17:15.760
And then it also augments skill, which allows me to better represent those ideas in questions,

17:15.760 --> 17:17.360
I think, feel a lot freer.

17:17.360 --> 17:23.760
So it's a lot like, feels like play in a way, feels like freedom of exploration, like when

17:23.760 --> 17:27.560
you were a kid, you know, it's something I haven't experienced since then outside of

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
this.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.880
So maybe why I'm such an evangelist.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.840
I also think, you know, speaking of collaborative, it reflects what you ask for.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.440
So if you ask for something very simple and generic, that's what it'll give you.

17:40.440 --> 17:47.400
I try to ask it for kind of abstract notions of connection, and it gives that to me.

17:47.400 --> 17:53.480
So it feels a lot like talking to a friend for me, collaborative, right?

17:53.480 --> 17:56.800
Feels like talking to a friend that never gets tired of talking to you and learns you

17:56.800 --> 17:59.560
better with every word that you speak to it.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.040
So it does feel collaborative.

18:01.040 --> 18:07.600
And it also encourages me to learn more because my prompting utilizes a lot of art terminology

18:07.600 --> 18:09.440
and art history.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.760
For example, using luminism as an art movement in the work will change the aesthetic.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.480
If you mix up a bunch of other prompts, you can combine all of these disparate ideas into

18:17.480 --> 18:20.280
something that feels really new.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.160
And so I've had to learn a lot more of that.

18:22.160 --> 18:27.280
And then photography, learning lenses and apertures and shutter speeds and lighting conditions and

18:27.280 --> 18:29.600
then mixing all of those into a prompt.

18:29.600 --> 18:32.760
It's really encouraged me to go deeper.

18:32.760 --> 18:39.160
And then, yeah, lastly, I'd say it's helped me know myself a lot better too because with

18:39.160 --> 18:43.200
AI, as you know, you can iterate a huge body of work very quickly.

18:43.200 --> 18:48.600
So I've created hundreds of thousands of pieces over the course of, let's say a year.

18:48.600 --> 18:53.440
I've been doing this for a few years, but I'll curate it down to five or so to share

18:53.440 --> 18:57.920
and maybe one to mint every three months or less.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.720
And so you really develop your taste, you really develop your aesthetic, your motifs,

19:01.720 --> 19:05.640
your patterns, your symbols, you figure yourself out with it.

19:05.640 --> 19:10.080
And I don't think that I would have done that either without using AI in my work.

19:10.080 --> 19:17.880
So I think it's made me a better NFT artist as well because the ones you resonate with

19:17.880 --> 19:21.960
most and it's hard when you have a huge body of work to know what you're going to do with

19:21.960 --> 19:23.600
that scarce opportunity.

19:23.600 --> 19:28.880
So I feel like it's helped me know myself more as well.

19:28.880 --> 19:30.880
Thank you, Claire.

19:30.880 --> 19:34.320
For those of you who don't know, Claire is my AI whisperer.

19:34.320 --> 19:42.320
So when I'm trying to create with my two left-thumbs prompt-generated art, she is someone

19:42.320 --> 19:44.040
I bounce my ideas off of.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.920
But hey, let's shift over to you.

19:45.920 --> 19:50.400
Your work is at the intersection of societal consciousness and digital art, which I think

19:50.400 --> 19:54.520
is a very interesting sort of crossover area.

19:54.520 --> 19:59.440
Could you tell us a bit more about Code Green and how that impacts your work as an artist?

19:59.440 --> 20:02.120
Yes, absolutely.

20:02.120 --> 20:04.840
So we funded Code Green.

20:04.840 --> 20:10.000
We started working on it in early 2021 and it took us a whole year before we launched

20:10.000 --> 20:14.480
it because I'm a traditional activist.

20:14.480 --> 20:22.640
And so I wanted, I saw the blockchain as this incredible way to disrupt traditional philanthropy.

20:22.640 --> 20:29.280
And our aim is to use the power of art and, you know, what, and tech to engage people

20:29.280 --> 20:34.280
in taking actions for either the planet or having an impact.

20:34.280 --> 20:39.480
And so for me as an artist, I've been using my voice for social gender and climate justice

20:39.480 --> 20:45.040
for the past 15 years and my art has always been intertwined with my activism.

20:45.040 --> 20:53.400
And either my photography, my films or my music, I always try to share messages that

20:53.400 --> 21:00.400
to be a messenger, to speak for people who doesn't, whose voice doesn't resonate as far

21:00.400 --> 21:02.280
as mine could.

21:02.280 --> 21:12.160
And so when we started this, as an artist, I saw the space as something remarkably innovative

21:12.160 --> 21:19.320
and giving the power to artists is giving the power to the space to create an incredible

21:19.320 --> 21:26.440
shift because our artists have always been tied to the biggest revolutions and evolution

21:26.440 --> 21:27.720
of humanity.

21:27.720 --> 21:34.360
And so for me, I felt like, okay, I have two hats and what I'm going to be doing in here

21:34.360 --> 21:40.000
because as an artist, I can share my art and experiment with the technology.

21:40.000 --> 21:48.840
But as an activist and a builder, I could really create a movement that goes beyond the space

21:48.840 --> 21:57.240
and that bridges a gap with the digital community and real life community all over, around the

21:57.240 --> 21:58.240
world.

21:58.240 --> 22:07.280
So what we do is we create a link between collectors, communities, artists and builders

22:07.280 --> 22:11.920
with different SDGs action.

22:11.920 --> 22:20.640
So we partnered with the UN SDG to do that and support the 17 SDGs and just try to make

22:20.640 --> 22:22.280
the world a better space.

22:22.280 --> 22:29.960
This is something that is not rooted in naivete or, you know, I'm not naive from where I

22:29.960 --> 22:30.960
come from.

22:30.960 --> 22:39.480
I know that working in some type of way can get you some places and that there is hope

22:39.480 --> 22:44.440
if you build and build and believe in what you're doing.

22:44.440 --> 22:53.200
And so it took me a whole year before sharing my minting, my first artwork because I was

22:53.200 --> 22:59.080
busy building this good green and trying to create something that was not really in the

22:59.080 --> 23:03.480
space and was not really what I was doing outside of the space.

23:03.480 --> 23:06.760
So I had to find a balance experiment with different things.

23:06.760 --> 23:14.840
And after a year we donated over two million dollars to organizations and people and really

23:14.840 --> 23:22.840
making an impact but also bringing awareness and showing people in the web three space

23:22.840 --> 23:30.160
that your voice count and that you can as an individual make a strong impact and have a

23:30.160 --> 23:38.960
say in what is happening in the world and also that's what the shift in governance means

23:38.960 --> 23:40.440
to me.

23:40.440 --> 23:50.080
And so yeah, it has been a very exciting and rewarding experience and learning as well.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.080
Thank you, you know.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.880
I love the tagline from your website, right?

23:52.880 --> 23:55.520
So the digital revolution for social evolution.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
I think that's super powerful.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.800
So thanks for that.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.520
And hey, Sasha, over to you.

24:00.520 --> 24:04.480
You've been described as a transhuman artist and an AI empowered poet, right?

24:04.480 --> 24:08.200
Can you tell us and double click on Metapoetry?

24:08.200 --> 24:10.120
Yeah, absolutely.

24:10.120 --> 24:14.360
And by the way, I'm just sitting here so fascinated by what everyone's been saying.

24:14.360 --> 24:20.400
I feel so grateful to get to hear more about the really beautiful practices and thought

24:20.400 --> 24:23.400
processes behind what you're all doing.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.240
So yes, my Metapoetry.

24:25.240 --> 24:31.000
Well, as I said before, I've been writing my entire life and I started writing in a little

24:31.000 --> 24:35.880
bit more of a traditional sense, but I think that's evolved really over time.

24:35.880 --> 24:40.320
I've always been really interested, I think, fundamentally in the idea of something called

24:40.320 --> 24:42.400
the R's Poetica.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.880
So literally R's Poetica translates to the art of poetry.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.160
It's this consideration of poetry as an art form.

24:49.160 --> 24:56.200
And in terms of genre, R's Poetica is actually formally about poems that are exploring the

24:56.200 --> 24:59.480
role of poetry and poets in society.

24:59.480 --> 25:03.880
They're poems that are really about the poet's relationship to language, the poet's relationship

25:03.880 --> 25:05.520
to the act of writing.

25:05.520 --> 25:10.200
And to me, I just find this so deeply, deeply fascinating from a conceptual point of view.

25:10.200 --> 25:16.640
And it's just fun for me to think about the idea of poetry that is self-aware or poetry

25:16.640 --> 25:17.680
that is about poetry.

25:17.680 --> 25:24.360
I think there's a lot that really intrigues me about that and relates to meta in a way

25:24.360 --> 25:25.560
that I'll get to in a second.

25:25.560 --> 25:30.960
But my first sustained project in this area was actually something called R's Poetica

25:30.960 --> 25:32.080
Cybernetica.

25:32.080 --> 25:37.440
So looking at poetry not just as an art form, but as a technological invention, kind of

25:37.440 --> 25:41.720
like bringing together R's Poetica and R's Technica in the way.

25:41.720 --> 25:46.760
And thinking through the poetics of networked imagination, kind of like Sam was referring

25:46.760 --> 25:52.360
to before, thinking about the poetics of intelligence systems and the poetics of technology and

25:52.360 --> 25:55.280
communications in a larger sense.

25:55.280 --> 25:59.800
So I think a lot of that is really baked into much of what I do.

25:59.800 --> 26:05.880
And it's just always propelled me to think of poetry not just in the conventional sense

26:05.880 --> 26:11.160
of poems that you read off a piece of paper or that you read in the New Yorker or whatever,

26:11.160 --> 26:18.400
but poems in a more expansive sense, poetry in a more experimental and conceptual understanding

26:18.400 --> 26:19.960
of that term.

26:19.960 --> 26:25.680
So when I say things like meta poetry, I'm really thinking of meta within the history

26:25.680 --> 26:33.080
of poetry, the poetic tradition and thinking of it more in the sense of the Greek understanding

26:33.080 --> 26:40.960
of meta as after, beyond, above, something that's kind of bigger and more all-encompassing.

26:40.960 --> 26:47.320
And again, that kind of refers back to this notion of poetry as really being something

26:47.320 --> 26:52.200
that is self-aware and something that helps us kind of understand ourselves and that activates

26:52.200 --> 26:53.200
something.

26:53.200 --> 27:01.000
It's not just storytelling, it's not just words on a page or words spoken into the air.

27:01.000 --> 27:06.200
It's actually kind of a software program that when it's deployed is actually making something

27:06.200 --> 27:07.200
happen.

27:07.200 --> 27:12.200
It's very interested in kind of the mechanisms that surround the context by which these things

27:12.200 --> 27:14.080
can happen.

27:14.080 --> 27:19.800
And when I use terms like transhumanism or if I'm described as a transhuman poet, that

27:19.800 --> 27:27.520
really I think has to do with the idea of transhumanism as a consideration of how advanced

27:27.520 --> 27:30.240
technologies can really enhance the human condition.

27:30.240 --> 27:34.920
And I mentioned before my first book and a lot of my practice is really about this.

27:34.920 --> 27:41.800
It's about what it means to be human in an age that is really dominated by machines and

27:41.800 --> 27:45.480
non-human intelligences in lots of ways.

27:45.480 --> 27:50.240
And so within that context, I'm thinking a lot about poetry as a technology that has

27:50.240 --> 27:55.720
enhanced our human experience and our human condition for more than thousands of years

27:55.720 --> 28:02.000
and kind of creating a through line and thinking about how advancing and speculative technologies

28:02.000 --> 28:09.840
like artificial intelligence, large language models like GPT-3 and soon GPT-4 and how things

28:09.840 --> 28:16.200
like text to image tools can continue to expand and enhance our imagination and empower us

28:16.200 --> 28:18.760
as human beings to understand ourselves in new ways.

28:18.760 --> 28:25.920
So yeah, that's I think that probably is a pretty good summation of all that and also

28:25.920 --> 28:30.920
explains why I'm really happy to be here in the web 3 space because a lot of these considerations

28:30.920 --> 28:39.240
are very, I think are very fringe still in the world of poetry in the literary establishment

28:39.240 --> 28:43.040
in the kind of more conventional writing communities.

28:43.040 --> 28:49.720
The idea of something like bringing in an AI to co-author a piece of text is still anathema

28:49.720 --> 28:50.720
in a lot of ways.

28:50.720 --> 28:56.640
So I think it's been really important and really, you know, it's been very essential,

28:56.640 --> 29:02.640
I think, to a lot of my practice to be able to explore some of these ideas and experiment

29:02.640 --> 29:10.160
with these tools in the kind of very experimental and open-minded community that we have here

29:10.160 --> 29:14.240
that's been, you know, fundamental, I think, to a lot of what I'm doing.

29:14.240 --> 29:17.200
So I'm grateful for that.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.200
Thanks, Asha, for that.

29:18.200 --> 29:25.920
I love how you're all kind of linking together, you know, in your own way, AI, blockchain technology

29:25.920 --> 29:27.080
and humanism, right?

29:27.080 --> 29:31.440
I mean, it's all imbued in everything that each and every one of you have been describing

29:31.440 --> 29:33.480
up to this point, which is pretty impressive.

29:33.480 --> 29:37.080
I want to go to some general questions now for the panel, right?

29:37.080 --> 29:39.080
And we'll start with you, Sam.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.200
We have, we've been hearing and seeing a lot about open editions of late, right?

29:43.200 --> 29:44.920
Almost drowning out one of one art.

29:44.920 --> 29:49.880
Do you see this as a positive and something that's a sustainable trend or is it something

29:49.880 --> 29:52.720
that we should be alarmed about?

29:52.720 --> 29:53.720
Yeah.

29:53.720 --> 29:58.000
Yeah.

29:58.000 --> 30:03.320
There are some undeniable, beautiful upsides, right?

30:03.320 --> 30:08.280
It's great to see many people enter into an artist's ecosystem affordably.

30:08.280 --> 30:14.960
It's great to see artists make great payouts when the individual high-level 101 collectors

30:14.960 --> 30:19.400
have either honed their taste to the point that they're kind of just after a few specific

30:19.400 --> 30:24.840
artists or are just more price sensitive than they were back in the bull market.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.800
And it's also just kind of a nice way to support artists.

30:28.800 --> 30:31.280
These things are obvious, right?

30:31.280 --> 30:37.840
There is the downsides that are just as obvious, flooding your own supply, these burn and redeem

30:37.840 --> 30:43.200
games that may or not have exactly a follow-up plan.

30:43.200 --> 30:51.640
But I don't really look at any of these new meadows rather with scorn or praise.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.440
I do them as things to be studied.

30:54.440 --> 30:58.640
You can either learn from them through participation or through studying.

30:58.640 --> 31:04.280
And for this particular one, I've chosen to learn from observation mostly because I already

31:04.280 --> 31:07.880
know where I'm going and it doesn't include this, right?

31:07.880 --> 31:09.400
Lucy is an episodic story.

31:09.400 --> 31:15.840
I've been working on it and it's arc for a long time.

31:15.840 --> 31:19.680
The next piece in this arc is a couple weeks away.

31:19.680 --> 31:24.120
The project after that is coming later this spring.

31:24.120 --> 31:30.840
Doing that kind of puts me away from being reactive to whatever the game at the moment

31:30.840 --> 31:35.600
is sometimes even at my own expense, right?

31:35.600 --> 31:45.720
So to try to create work, I learned something in the creation process that usually demands

31:45.720 --> 31:47.880
time out of me.

31:47.880 --> 31:51.520
Time is something that I think about a lot.

31:51.520 --> 31:58.040
The potential rewards for engaging in this particular wave, the risks of derailing design

31:58.040 --> 32:01.960
that I put in motion for the next year, is just a little too high for me.

32:01.960 --> 32:07.880
It feels like something that could maybe fill some coffers now, have under maybe the branding

32:07.880 --> 32:10.280
or guys of accessibility.

32:10.280 --> 32:18.920
But if I'm being very honest, it feels too disposable and interchangeable in this iteration.

32:18.920 --> 32:21.520
There's something missing in it.

32:21.520 --> 32:25.240
Creating work to be discarded for other work to be discarded.

32:25.240 --> 32:29.520
Conceptually, this just honestly just does not align with my own value.

32:29.520 --> 32:33.600
I don't fault anyone for participating in it.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.440
That might be my own weakness, right?

32:35.440 --> 32:40.800
Perhaps I hold art as too sacred because releasing this work with Lucy, it's changed my life

32:40.800 --> 32:43.440
so drastically.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.880
I hope every artist in this wave will take these drips and roll it into creating great

32:47.880 --> 32:52.600
work, have a mess of new supporters that it dilutes nothing and it only opens each of

32:52.600 --> 32:54.880
them to a bigger world.

32:54.880 --> 33:00.760
But for my own goals, which are perhaps outside of that, I think time will agree with this

33:00.760 --> 33:02.840
instinct.

33:02.840 --> 33:08.040
In either direction, and maybe this is more important than anything, both in my desire

33:08.040 --> 33:12.360
to skip it and what could be lost in that, and in others who participate in it, either

33:12.360 --> 33:16.600
as an artist or as a collector.

33:16.600 --> 33:21.400
Above all, I just think it's very important that everyone remember to take personal responsibility

33:21.400 --> 33:23.400
for whatever may come.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.480
Thanks, Sam.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.840
Be thoughtful is what I pick up, right?

33:28.840 --> 33:30.760
Be very thoughtful about what you do here.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.840
You know, yeah, you know, over to you.

33:32.840 --> 33:35.360
Same question.

33:35.360 --> 33:40.520
I think that open edition can be great ways for artists to give an affordable access to

33:40.520 --> 33:43.280
their work to anyone who'd like to own it.

33:43.280 --> 33:50.040
I think people can experiment and play around because this industry is really young, so it's

33:50.040 --> 33:57.240
good to play an experiment as long as the expectations are reasonable on both sides.

33:57.240 --> 33:58.400
And it's art.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.920
There's no road map there.

33:59.920 --> 34:03.160
It's art and it's enough.

34:03.160 --> 34:07.120
So it depends on why you do it.

34:07.120 --> 34:09.040
It's important to be intentional.

34:09.040 --> 34:17.200
Like Sam said, it's important to be thoughtful in both ways for either the artist and the

34:17.200 --> 34:18.200
collectors.

34:18.200 --> 34:22.520
And I haven't even done an edition yet.

34:22.520 --> 34:30.560
I'm currently working on my first edition, so I don't picture open editions for myself,

34:30.560 --> 34:34.320
but I can see why some artists do it.

34:34.320 --> 34:40.760
I've bought some open editions because I really love the art and I've always wanted to own

34:40.760 --> 34:44.360
one of the art from a specific artist.

34:44.360 --> 34:50.920
But I've never sold an NFT, except from what I created any NFT that I bought.

34:50.920 --> 34:53.400
I've never sold any ever yet.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.080
So I'm not a flavor.

34:55.080 --> 34:57.600
I'm not an investor.

34:57.600 --> 35:02.320
An art lover, so my perspective comes from that stance.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.600
Love that, love that, Ina.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.840
Clear over to you.

35:05.840 --> 35:06.840
Same question.

35:06.840 --> 35:07.840
Yeah, sorry.

35:07.840 --> 35:10.840
I had to find the unmute button there.

35:10.840 --> 35:11.840
Yeah.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.480
So this is a tough one.

35:13.480 --> 35:19.600
Open editions are a scary thing, I think, for a lot of artists because of scarcity, right?

35:19.600 --> 35:24.720
And worries that collectors will be hurt by doing that.

35:24.720 --> 35:30.560
I thought about it a long time and I actually did an open edition myself.

35:30.560 --> 35:32.600
But it was in a very specific context.

35:32.600 --> 35:37.560
It was after I'd been getting a lot of comments that people were lamenting that they couldn't

35:37.560 --> 35:42.720
collect a piece because my one of one floor went so out of range for most people and my

35:42.720 --> 35:45.720
collections were also moving out of range.

35:45.720 --> 35:50.080
Around the same time, NFT gateway reached out and offered to do a solo drop for an open

35:50.080 --> 35:51.080
edition.

35:51.080 --> 35:56.360
So I agreed, but what I did was I structured the drop to reward my collection holders and

35:56.360 --> 35:58.440
my one of one holders.

35:58.440 --> 36:02.160
And I also made it the shortest time window that you could with NFT gateway.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.000
So that would be a 10 minute drop.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.320
And I also sold a one of one sort of in conjunction.

36:08.320 --> 36:12.920
So there was still a tier of that sort of game theory of scarcity involved.

36:12.920 --> 36:16.120
So I think thoughtful is the good word for that.

36:16.120 --> 36:22.360
I will say that open editions do build a broad community, which is always good.

36:22.360 --> 36:27.960
And a broad community also means more opportunities for you as your audience grows and your reach

36:27.960 --> 36:30.240
grows.

36:30.240 --> 36:35.240
Theoretically more value to your scarce one of one work as well as long as you follow

36:35.240 --> 36:40.720
an open edition with scarcity and as long as you don't do them repeatedly or for an

36:40.720 --> 36:43.480
hour or a day or whatever long time window.

36:43.480 --> 36:49.560
I think that there is a way to structure them so that it won't harm you and can be a good

36:49.560 --> 36:54.600
thing, but you have to be very, very intentional about it.

36:54.600 --> 36:55.600
Thanks, Claire.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.160
So be thoughtful and use it as a leverage point for building community.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.160
Great points.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.600
Sasha, last but not least.

37:02.600 --> 37:11.840
Yeah, so I actually really am interested in open editions as they kind of relate to the

37:11.840 --> 37:13.680
history of literature and publishing.

37:13.680 --> 37:19.280
I kind of mentioned before I am very intrigued in sort of thinking about blockchain within

37:19.280 --> 37:23.920
the context of historical publishing innovations.

37:23.920 --> 37:28.880
And open editions actually have a really important role in the history of literature in the

37:28.880 --> 37:32.280
form of broadsides.

37:32.280 --> 37:41.160
So when we were kind of moving away from handwritten literature during the advent of

37:41.160 --> 37:46.920
printing press after Gutenberg's invention of movable type and all that, poetry broadsides

37:46.920 --> 37:53.080
actually became a very important medium for cultural transmission.

37:53.080 --> 37:58.960
Broad size in general, which are basically just kind of cheap readily, printable readily

37:58.960 --> 38:06.000
available pieces of paper with text written on them, became a really essential way for

38:06.000 --> 38:11.040
public announcements to be made and for poets to share their work and actually for songwriters

38:11.040 --> 38:13.480
and lyricists to share ballads.

38:13.480 --> 38:17.320
And there's just hundreds of years ago, so obviously quite different than what we're

38:17.320 --> 38:21.800
talking about here, but I can't help thinking about open editions and editions in general

38:21.800 --> 38:24.720
kind of in that context of the broadside.

38:24.720 --> 38:30.560
And in fact, I've done quite a few projects that really invoke using blockchain as sort

38:30.560 --> 38:36.560
of a bespoke printing press in homage to someone like Gutenberg in which we can create

38:36.560 --> 38:38.080
many editions.

38:38.080 --> 38:43.480
Sometimes they're all the same, sometimes they are algorithmically generated to be

38:43.480 --> 38:49.840
slightly different, but this idea of being able to print something in multiple copies

38:49.840 --> 38:54.520
and then share it with a broad audience I think is really instrumental in the history

38:54.520 --> 39:00.400
of the dissemination of information and in turn the empowerment of the public and of

39:00.400 --> 39:04.320
readers through that technological step forward.

39:04.320 --> 39:09.680
So I think from that sense, I really like playing with the idea of what an open edition

39:09.680 --> 39:10.680
represents.

39:10.680 --> 39:17.240
I actually have an open edition right now with super chief Nifty Gateway, which is up

39:17.240 --> 39:23.560
for another day or so, and I'm kind of interested in how it's being received and how people

39:23.560 --> 39:24.880
are kind of engaging with it.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.280
That's all very interesting to me.

39:27.280 --> 39:33.680
And again, really like thinking about what it means to have a piece of work available

39:33.680 --> 39:38.120
in that sense and at the same time have a whole roster of one of ones that do something

39:38.120 --> 39:39.120
very different.

39:39.120 --> 39:46.880
And I think one of the reasons I'm in this space is because I do see the potential for

39:46.880 --> 39:54.520
web3 and for all the technologies that we're discussing to really help writers stand up

39:54.520 --> 39:57.280
for the value of their work in a way that we haven't been able to before.

39:57.280 --> 40:02.800
I think there is sort of an implicit understanding that writing, that literature, because it

40:02.800 --> 40:10.160
can be easily reproduced and printed, that it's worth less than fine art, for example.

40:10.160 --> 40:14.360
And one of the things that I'm very interested in personally and that I'm also working for

40:14.360 --> 40:20.360
at the verse verse, which I mentioned earlier, is this idea that poems really have intrinsic

40:20.360 --> 40:26.920
value and deserved to sort of be considered as inherently valuable alongside art in a

40:26.920 --> 40:28.360
way that they haven't in the past.

40:28.360 --> 40:34.040
And I think that that, in that sense, the role of one of ones is really critical.

40:34.040 --> 40:39.640
Thinking about the ability of a poet to take a single poem and not just distributed as

40:39.640 --> 40:44.600
a broadside or not just distributed within a printed collection of other poems, not just

40:44.600 --> 40:50.160
distributed within a literary journal or within another magazine where that poem is packaged

40:50.160 --> 40:54.480
together with hundreds of other pages of material.

40:54.480 --> 40:59.080
But for that poem to be able to stand on its own, and especially for a poem like that to

40:59.080 --> 41:04.720
stand on its own, liberated from between the covers of a book and stand as a one of one,

41:04.720 --> 41:12.800
is also very, I think, sort of a new way of thinking about poetry.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.440
So I see both the value for open editions.

41:15.440 --> 41:19.880
I think, again, conceptually they're incredibly interesting and I think they can be very empowering

41:19.880 --> 41:26.320
for poets as far as a way to actually make money from writing in a very novel approach.

41:26.320 --> 41:32.800
But I also see the incredible value of one of ones for really kind of planting a flag

41:32.800 --> 41:36.880
for the idea of poems as one of one artworks in their own right.

41:36.880 --> 41:42.720
And again, that's something that I think is very different than the way poems have been

41:42.720 --> 41:46.080
sort of treated in the course of human history.

41:46.080 --> 41:47.080
Thanks, Ash.

41:47.080 --> 41:50.160
I love the way you drew the analogy back to broadside, right?

41:50.160 --> 41:58.680
I mean, effectively what was in many ways means and connecting with the people through

41:58.680 --> 42:03.320
a means of communication and how you link that back to open editions.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.560
That was pretty powerful.

42:04.560 --> 42:07.200
Good stuff from the panel here.

42:07.200 --> 42:11.200
All right, let's move on to our next question here.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.600
This is an interesting one.

42:12.600 --> 42:20.480
You hear, oftentimes, people describe the current art scene, whether it's digital art

42:20.480 --> 42:26.280
photography, whether it's generative, as a little bit of a circle jerk or an echo chamber,

42:26.280 --> 42:27.280
right?

42:27.280 --> 42:31.240
And then what advice would you have for new artists and also collectors that are entering

42:31.240 --> 42:32.560
the space, right?

42:32.560 --> 42:37.120
What would be some effective approaches for them to engage in the community?

42:37.120 --> 42:41.920
And how do we sort of expand and broaden the list of participants?

42:41.920 --> 42:44.600
But Claire, I'll start with you on this one.

42:44.600 --> 42:45.880
Yeah, sure.

42:45.880 --> 42:50.520
So my advice for new artists and maybe collectors too, I hadn't thought about it as much.

42:50.520 --> 42:57.680
But I would say lean into your art, obviously, but then when that starts to slow down, either

42:57.680 --> 43:04.480
by your own kind of drive and inspiration kind of cycling or just by lack of engagement,

43:04.480 --> 43:09.080
I would say lean into community building, Twitter spaces, education, that kind of thing.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.480
So it's kind of like a pendulum.

43:11.480 --> 43:16.160
You lean into the interior world and then you lean into engaging with others and helping

43:16.160 --> 43:17.520
them where you can.

43:17.520 --> 43:21.480
And then you lean back into your interior world and you just sort of repeat this pendulum

43:21.480 --> 43:23.360
sort of motion.

43:23.360 --> 43:28.360
And doing that, I think, replenishes your inspiration, but it also builds a following

43:28.360 --> 43:32.760
of friends that are naturally interested in your work, naturally interested in wanting

43:32.760 --> 43:37.160
to support you and be involved in the projects that you'd like to see succeed.

43:37.160 --> 43:42.040
I think that, yeah, swinging sort of back and forth slowly has been very useful for me.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.320
And that's what I would recommend.

43:44.320 --> 43:45.840
Thanks, Claire.

43:45.840 --> 43:47.840
Sam?

43:47.840 --> 43:54.640
Yeah, I mean, look, it's an amazing time to be a digital artist right now.

43:54.640 --> 43:57.880
Best time ever I've been doing this for a while.

43:57.880 --> 44:03.800
Maybe it's a little bit harder because the tools are so accessible, sophisticated and

44:03.800 --> 44:05.600
powerful, but I don't know.

44:05.600 --> 44:10.120
I just think that's even better because it kind of puts a fire under your ass to pull

44:10.120 --> 44:11.920
something real out of you.

44:11.920 --> 44:22.000
As far as advice, man, I would definitely focus on the hard angle personally rather

44:22.000 --> 44:28.960
than anything web-free specific because, I mean, you as an individual are a tiny little

44:28.960 --> 44:29.960
spark, right?

44:29.960 --> 44:36.080
You've got to nurture it with kindling care, knowledge and resources to make that sucker

44:36.080 --> 44:38.200
grow.

44:38.200 --> 44:41.200
Then you can attract the community to it, right?

44:41.200 --> 44:47.600
You got to start close in to bring a little David White into the conversation.

44:47.600 --> 44:51.520
Get your own house in order before worrying about others.

44:51.520 --> 44:56.960
And for me, that is identify the areas that you struggle with the most.

44:56.960 --> 45:02.560
Talking about being a painter here, that might be anatomy, color, light, or cocktail of any

45:02.560 --> 45:03.560
of these.

45:03.560 --> 45:10.720
Just any tension point where you find limiting the kinds of art that you are able to make,

45:10.720 --> 45:16.640
in doing the hard work to learn what it takes to get what's in your head out on the canvas,

45:16.640 --> 45:20.000
or whatever your medium is as fluidly as possible.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.480
It just never shy away from things that you're bad at.

45:23.480 --> 45:29.720
You can go infinitely into absolutely everything to find even one small thing to get good at

45:29.720 --> 45:33.560
is a beautiful gift and you should feel no shame in struggling.

45:33.560 --> 45:41.240
So long as you're putting time, energy, love, and humility into truly learning it, don't

45:41.240 --> 45:44.240
mess around with pop culture too much.

45:44.240 --> 45:47.720
Find out who you are, be in your mind and body in this world.

45:47.720 --> 45:53.400
Best way to do that is to learn a lot of different things, as much as you possibly can, and to

45:53.400 --> 45:59.080
start feeling your own gravity in one direction or another.

45:59.080 --> 46:03.160
Because when you do feel that pull, and it can take a long time to get there, but when

46:03.160 --> 46:06.600
you feel it, that's that time.

46:06.600 --> 46:12.280
You've got to seize that and start going infinitely into building out that universe of that feeling

46:12.280 --> 46:18.440
to go down every single little rabbit hole within it to see what does your mind look like when

46:18.440 --> 46:20.320
you've extracted it out of you.

46:20.320 --> 46:24.120
Don't dabble around and little one-offs here and there.

46:24.120 --> 46:27.120
You're saying it doesn't matter how silly it is.

46:27.120 --> 46:28.840
I paint monkeys, right?

46:28.840 --> 46:33.840
But I really mean it, I really mean it when I make them.

46:33.840 --> 46:40.200
I think just try to grow, stay with other artists, be vulnerable with them while being

46:40.200 --> 46:45.400
hungry, share the struggles that you're having as an artist.

46:45.400 --> 46:49.600
You're going to get a lot of vulnerability and return from others.

46:49.600 --> 46:52.440
You mentioned circle jerk.

46:52.440 --> 46:57.560
It's a great term for this because this is not about just being like two people being

46:57.560 --> 46:59.320
sad artists together.

46:59.320 --> 47:00.320
That's a nightmare.

47:00.320 --> 47:03.320
You don't want to be in that little cycle.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.800
You both have to have growth in mind.

47:05.800 --> 47:11.000
These bonds that form from people helping each other push you.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.640
It makes you learn together faster, better, more efficiently.

47:14.640 --> 47:20.040
And in my view personally, most importantly, competitively.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.800
Like that push and pull of different people learning at different paces trying to catch

47:23.800 --> 47:24.920
each other.

47:24.920 --> 47:31.440
It's like we're all just little wolves in the forest playing around with each other.

47:31.440 --> 47:35.440
And it lights this fire in you, this soul to play the game.

47:35.440 --> 47:42.760
Like two of my closest friends, a photographer named Jo-El and Victor Phoosius.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.560
These are friendships that are not just for fun, right?

47:46.560 --> 47:48.280
They're not just, oh, I like you.

47:48.280 --> 47:49.280
How are you feeling?

47:49.280 --> 47:50.280
How did you sleep?

47:50.280 --> 47:56.120
We're here to push each other to help each other grow.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.120
I love that.

47:57.120 --> 48:03.440
So focus on the art and build the network and really challenge yourselves.

48:03.440 --> 48:04.440
Nice one.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.720
Over to you.

48:07.720 --> 48:13.680
So I think that we have amazing tools to push the boundaries of visual storytelling in poetry

48:13.680 --> 48:18.880
and whatever form of art that you want to share.

48:18.880 --> 48:23.280
And the decentralized nature of this makes it accessible to everyone.

48:23.280 --> 48:29.040
So I think that art is coming into this should experiment, try new things and not be scared

48:29.040 --> 48:30.440
to fail.

48:30.440 --> 48:35.560
And art has the power to transform your dreams into reality and reality into dreams.

48:35.560 --> 48:37.600
So dream bigger and bigger.

48:37.600 --> 48:41.960
Share your work, connect with people, make friends.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.760
You will probably have people who will also hate your work.

48:45.760 --> 48:53.320
Deal with that and really, I think that this is a great time to be an artist because there

48:53.320 --> 48:59.520
is so much empowerment and there is so much things that you can do from your room.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.400
You don't need to be in an art gallery.

49:02.400 --> 49:04.000
You don't need to be chosen.

49:04.000 --> 49:09.440
You have to choose yourself and you have to choose to put yourself out there and share

49:09.440 --> 49:14.760
what the art that you created for the whole world.

49:14.760 --> 49:18.520
There is a huge potential of connecting with people.

49:18.520 --> 49:25.480
And so I think that the fact that there is kind of no limit is super exciting.

49:25.480 --> 49:31.880
And it's a moment where more and more artists can share different types of works.

49:31.880 --> 49:33.640
And we're open to it.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.680
We're open to receiving it.

49:35.680 --> 49:42.400
And we're in this together because it's such a young space that the technology and art

49:42.400 --> 49:43.400
coming together.

49:43.400 --> 49:45.640
And we're all experimenting at the same time.

49:45.640 --> 49:55.560
So there's no bad ways because we are kind of learning on the way.

49:55.560 --> 50:05.080
And for collectors, I think the same really by what you want, by what speaks to you, by

50:05.080 --> 50:12.760
what means something to you and do research and connect with artists and create links.

50:12.760 --> 50:19.440
The human links that we are making right now is something that is so, so, so important

50:19.440 --> 50:22.120
and that I cherish every day.

50:22.120 --> 50:24.120
Thanks, Ena.

50:24.120 --> 50:25.640
So really zoom out, right?

50:25.640 --> 50:29.280
I mean, as you said, we're super early and it's about the connections.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.280
Love that.

50:30.280 --> 50:32.840
Hey, Sasha, last but not least again.

50:32.840 --> 50:37.760
Yeah, I'm loving all of this.

50:37.760 --> 50:41.960
I guess two things that I would highlight that have been really important for me.

50:41.960 --> 50:46.520
One is that I really think it's important, even though we're in this space that tends

50:46.520 --> 50:51.800
to be so trend driven, I think it's really important to just really follow your own interests

50:51.800 --> 50:56.120
and your own obsessions and go where they lead you.

50:56.120 --> 51:02.360
I've been working with AI language since about 2018 in earnest.

51:02.360 --> 51:11.920
And when I started doing it, nobody was using GPT to write real poetry or anything like that.

51:11.920 --> 51:18.160
And I was definitely trying to take things into workshops and show my friends and got

51:18.160 --> 51:20.120
a lot of very weird reactions.

51:20.120 --> 51:23.240
And I kept doing it because it was really interesting to me.

51:23.240 --> 51:27.600
I just thought it was fascinating and I was personally inspired and just exhilarated by

51:27.600 --> 51:28.600
what I was discovering.

51:28.600 --> 51:35.640
And lo and behold, fast forward a few years and now chat GPT is taken off and every time

51:35.640 --> 51:40.400
I open a newspaper or listen to a podcast, people are talking about AI language and it's

51:40.400 --> 51:42.000
just astonishing.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.560
And I'm really grateful that I stuck to it and I didn't get discouraged in the beginning

51:45.560 --> 51:51.320
by the fact that I was starting to share things and was sort of hearing crickets.

51:51.320 --> 51:57.120
I think that it's very tempting, especially because the space is so quick and so fast

51:57.120 --> 52:00.440
paced and can sometimes feel like a popularity contest.

52:00.440 --> 52:04.760
It does feel like you want to do what seems to be successful.

52:04.760 --> 52:10.520
And I would just say just remember that that's not necessarily going to work out well.

52:10.520 --> 52:16.160
I think it's really important that artists go deep into their own fascinations and obsessions

52:16.160 --> 52:20.200
and really just chase them wherever they can go.

52:20.200 --> 52:25.680
And the other thing is that I think participating in the ecosystem is incredibly important.

52:25.680 --> 52:31.160
When I first started minting, I took some time before my first mint to really get to

52:31.160 --> 52:35.720
know some of the different ecosystems and the different platforms and to understand

52:35.720 --> 52:40.520
what kinds of art was being minted where and to see where I felt at home.

52:40.520 --> 52:45.400
And to really go where I felt like I had genuine relationships with people and I wasn't just

52:45.400 --> 52:49.280
kind of dropping into something unprepared.

52:49.280 --> 52:54.800
And I think over time what's really served me best has been actively and genuinely participating

52:54.800 --> 52:59.840
in the ecosystems where I really feel that I belong and that I'm inspired by.

52:59.840 --> 53:06.560
And that means not just dropping into mint and to show my work but to actively be involved

53:06.560 --> 53:10.400
in the community to sort of look at what can be done to help build the community, to be

53:10.400 --> 53:15.860
an active participant in collecting works by the artists that I admire, to help onboard

53:15.860 --> 53:21.080
new people to the ecosystem, to actively kind of reach out and see if there's people who

53:21.080 --> 53:23.440
are struggling and who want to be part of it.

53:23.440 --> 53:27.760
All those things are really essential to the health of the overall ecosystem.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.720
And ultimately will be beneficial to us all.

53:30.720 --> 53:35.600
So I think that's really just kind of like a fundamental thing.

53:35.600 --> 53:41.720
It's like table stakes to be part of this is that you really need to be engaged in a really

53:41.720 --> 53:43.760
authentic and meaningful way.

53:43.760 --> 53:48.560
So I think those are the two things that are sort of first and foremost in my mind these

53:48.560 --> 53:49.560
days.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.560
Thanks, Sasha.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.680
Be authentic, engage, go deep, right?

53:54.680 --> 53:58.520
And build a community and a network and expand from there.

53:58.520 --> 53:59.520
Love it.

53:59.520 --> 54:00.520
All right.

54:00.520 --> 54:02.160
So we're going to move on to our final question.

54:02.160 --> 54:05.440
And you know, Ina, I'm going to start with you on this one.

54:05.440 --> 54:10.280
So if you could play Nostradamus for a moment and prognosticate, right?

54:10.280 --> 54:15.600
Where do you see one of one digital art five years from now?

54:15.600 --> 54:22.200
I think that there is no limit because art is the voice and expression of people.

54:22.200 --> 54:27.520
And honestly, I think that it will just be considered art.

54:27.520 --> 54:34.920
I'm not even sure that we're going to be using it as digital because in my shilling, many

54:34.920 --> 54:41.920
people have been using digital art as to it's not like real art, but it is.

54:41.920 --> 54:48.000
I think that it will the mediums where art are shared will change and will give access

54:48.000 --> 54:53.080
to digital art into places where they don't exist for now.

54:53.080 --> 54:57.040
And I'm very excited about this because this is a change.

54:57.040 --> 54:59.720
It's a big change and change drives history.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.240
And right now we're living through change so profound.

55:02.240 --> 55:06.840
I feel like we're a moment where what we're doing right now will ship the culture.

55:06.840 --> 55:08.400
And I'm super excited about it.

55:08.400 --> 55:14.240
And art has always been used in the past to disrupt the status quo or support humanist

55:14.240 --> 55:18.560
communities because revolution or evolution.

55:18.560 --> 55:26.880
I can't wait to see where we will be in five years, but I think that we just started to

55:26.880 --> 55:35.600
scratch the surface and it's going so fast that five years and our time is such a whole

55:35.600 --> 55:36.600
world.

55:36.600 --> 55:39.960
So I'm pretty excited to see where we'll be at.

55:39.960 --> 55:40.960
Thanks, Ina.

55:40.960 --> 55:41.960
Sasha.

55:41.960 --> 55:45.400
Oh, goodness.

55:45.400 --> 55:50.760
Well, I'm obviously thinking quite a lot about language.

55:50.760 --> 55:55.600
And I think we're seeing things change almost on a daily basis when it comes to what's possible

55:55.600 --> 55:57.640
with AI powered large language models.

55:57.640 --> 56:01.160
So it's pretty wild even in the short time span.

56:01.160 --> 56:04.920
So to think about where we might be in five years is mind boggling.

56:04.920 --> 56:10.960
I do feel like when I take a step back, we are on the cusp of something more profound

56:10.960 --> 56:13.440
and more pivotal than I think most of us realize.

56:13.440 --> 56:18.440
When I think about the work that I'm doing with AI language, I tend to kind of consider

56:18.440 --> 56:25.040
it in this larger frame of the history of human language from the development of the

56:25.040 --> 56:28.760
oral tradition to the advent of written language.

56:28.760 --> 56:33.680
And now it kind of feels like we're on the cusp of quite like on the right terminology

56:33.680 --> 56:39.480
for it yet, but it's this new kind of generative literature that really embodies all the things

56:39.480 --> 56:43.680
we've been talking about today, but literature and language that's powered by networked imagination

56:43.680 --> 56:48.240
and collective consciousness and powered by community.

56:48.240 --> 56:54.880
And I think that that is something that has so much potential to really shift not just

56:54.880 --> 56:59.320
the way, for example, books are made and distributed or anything like that, but really to change

56:59.320 --> 57:03.400
the way that humans think and how we share stories and how we understand ourselves and

57:03.400 --> 57:04.480
our place in the world.

57:04.480 --> 57:10.720
So I'm constantly trying to wrap my mind around it.

57:10.720 --> 57:15.640
And related to that, I think that this is the reason I'm so excited about working particularly

57:15.640 --> 57:18.920
with poetry and with language on the blockchain.

57:18.920 --> 57:26.200
I think that the rise of poetry and FTS kind of nods to this larger shift towards this

57:26.200 --> 57:32.840
new way of communicating and this new kind of understanding ourselves and the rise of

57:32.840 --> 57:37.120
machine code as a new kind of universal language.

57:37.120 --> 57:41.480
I think all of that is sort of that play when we're thinking about poetry and generative

57:41.480 --> 57:46.480
text and the ability to preserve ideas via blockchain.

57:46.480 --> 57:52.480
It's like all part and parcel of sort of the same general idea.

57:52.480 --> 57:56.400
And I think more concretely, like in five years, I really think that we'll have seen

57:56.400 --> 58:04.320
the rise of a poetry market, the rise of a new group of poetry collectors who are really

58:04.320 --> 58:07.400
paying attention to poetry in ways that they haven't done before.

58:07.400 --> 58:11.400
I think that we have this very established art market that's been in place for a long

58:11.400 --> 58:12.400
time.

58:12.400 --> 58:18.640
And I think as all of this new attention is kind of being shifted towards the role of

58:18.640 --> 58:24.160
language in daily human life, not just in poetry, but in text to image generators and

58:24.160 --> 58:29.440
using chat GPT and businesses and all this kind of stuff, I think that language is really

58:29.440 --> 58:34.760
going to take on a very different role that cultural, you know, the cultural appreciation

58:34.760 --> 58:36.480
of language will take on a different role.

58:36.480 --> 58:43.080
So I think for that reason, no, it's going to be very exciting to watch the increase,

58:43.080 --> 58:45.560
the influx of writers into the web three space.

58:45.560 --> 58:50.960
And I think we're going to see a huge shift and a huge paradigm change there very soon.

58:50.960 --> 58:51.960
Thank you, Sasha.

58:51.960 --> 58:52.960
Clear.

58:52.960 --> 59:00.720
Hey, yeah, so I will go ahead and warn you, I am quote unquote bullish on futuristic

59:00.720 --> 59:01.960
predictions in general.

59:01.960 --> 59:05.920
So this is probably going to be a little beyond what most people would envision, but I think

59:05.920 --> 59:08.440
I'm probably right.

59:08.440 --> 59:09.440
Five years.

59:09.440 --> 59:16.680
So in the last year with AI specifically, we've come a universe, right, in terms of

59:16.680 --> 59:21.120
space from where we were to where we are five years.

59:21.120 --> 59:29.200
I see AI assisted creation of personalized metaverse worlds that that probably will be

59:29.200 --> 59:34.760
the component that actually allows the metaverse to take hold like it should as a concept,

59:34.760 --> 59:39.080
particularly using AR or VR, which is not developed enough yet.

59:39.080 --> 59:44.000
But I know next year, Apple will be dropping some AR glasses that are lightweight and not

59:44.000 --> 59:45.080
particularly ugly.

59:45.080 --> 59:49.840
So I imagine we'll have more of a mass adoption moment there and VR will follow.

59:49.840 --> 59:54.760
There is a creator named Cuddly salmon, which is a great Twitter handle who I love.

59:54.760 --> 01:00:02.400
And she is using AI right now to create environments in virtual reality and project them live.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:06.360
And so basically she puts on her headset and she's in the location that she just created

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.840
with staple diffusion.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:14.840
I know there are also programs that now let you project AI images onto 3D environments.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:20.760
So there's like a use case for texturing live, even theoretically, where you could type in

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.960
and texture live around you.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.080
So anyway, that's sort of the zoomed in version.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:31.040
The zoomed out version is I think that personalized independent media creation, exactly to your

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.040
taste from your bedroom is going to be the trend in five years.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:41.080
And that will go for general NFT and art creation and with AI as well.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:48.400
So art literature, films, video games, music, worlds, experiences, all by individuals or

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.720
by small groups working together with open source tools.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:57.280
So I think we're going to see the death of some of these larger IP studios when that

01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:02.120
happens, but in their place, I think we'll see the rise of creative collectives and independent

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120
artists.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:08.600
And that's going to be empowered by blockchain technology because it establishes provenance.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:14.520
It sort of sorts out a lot of these scary, you know, financial and legal gray areas around

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:19.840
selling your work and establishing when it was made and how and all of that automatically.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.680
So I would say start exploring the tools that are out there now and in five years, you'll

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:27.280
be very happy that you did.

01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.440
Quite bullish.

01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.440
Thank you, Clara.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.440
Sam.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:39.800
Damn, Clara, that was a hell of an answer and I agree with so much of that.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.240
You know, I'm kind of in an interesting position, right?

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:52.480
There is this understandable, but maybe naive battle happening right now around AI art and

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:56.360
of what's authentic of what's human of what has sold.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.160
For me, I'm on the other side of this, right?

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.280
My art is extractions.

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.360
Every single one of these things takes so much time and effort and crafted to make

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.280
them sing.

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:15.280
They're filled with detail, but the art in what I do is not found in perfect imagery.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.840
It's found in the flawed attempt to create it.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.240
And it's in that attempt where you will see my weaknesses, my fixation.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:27.080
The areas where my mind has closed and my vision has narrowed.

01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:32.880
So in my art is labor, like man hours poured into making singular images.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:37.840
And because of these things, many, many that I speak to assume that I would be an enemy

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:43.340
of AI art, that I would either add to the moral panic of it or plant my feet in and

01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:45.440
be scared that it will replace me.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:51.000
But I am much more in the Claire School of Thought than that.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.280
I am neither of these things because to me art is not about image making.

01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.760
It is really about growth.

01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:03.920
I see a multi-generational upheaval towards the creation of art at a massive magnitude.

01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:12.120
AI is spreading this attempt of image making to everyone, all age ranges, socioeconomic

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:17.760
statuses, image making, and eventually art as we know it is about to become something

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.480
that every person in the world is capable of and in time will have access to writers

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.080
as Sasha suggested will become very powerful for a time.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:31.840
Thinkers, scholars will become even more powerful as the line blurs further in our thoughts

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:38.360
alone serve as inputs for the generation of these world's self-generator worlds that

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.360
Claire suggested.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.720
And I see this divide that may be existing right now, like do we preserve our individual

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:50.920
humanity or are we going to become part of a collective high mind?

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:51.920
It's neither, right?

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.040
They are dialectically coherent.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.040
They overlap.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.200
It's both.

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.040
It's just what we've talked about with one of one art.

01:03:59.040 --> 01:04:04.680
You are able to document the source of yourself and your energy and you are also able to engage

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.960
in a broader community and world of art.

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:14.160
I view these things as very linked and I think that quite frankly, this conversation and

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:20.640
some of the people are in it are going to be leaders and trying to connect the philosophical

01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:28.840
story and lore of humanity as an individual connecting to the larger unit without losing

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:34.160
yourself than just about any other artist I know in this space.

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.040
I'm very grateful to be up here with you.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:44.960
And to be honest, I'm actually most curious about what Barack would say to this question.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.720
If you're going to go Nostradamus, where do you see this?

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.720
Wow.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.160
It's hard for me to follow big brains like y'all, right?

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:54.680
But I will say I'm very, very bullish.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:05:01.600
I think what you've all shared, which is the human aspect of how we intersect across this

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:07.240
pyramid, if you will, the human aspect, the AI aspect, the art aspect, all coming together.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:12.520
I think there's a perfect intersection of all of the disruption that will happen.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:16.720
And I love the fact that it's putting power in the hands of the creator, right?

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:26.120
The creatives versus centralized organizations and big technology companies and studios,

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.120
right?

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:35.280
So, Claire's point on disrupting media, disrupting studios, disrupting big tech.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.280
It's powerful.

01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:44.600
It's the ultimate decentralization, open source movement and transformation so that anybody

01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:50.040
back to a point that you made, Sam, that even little kids, right, are going to start being

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:51.480
very disruptive.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:57.640
But I think what we're seeing with GPT-3 and with GPT-4 that's going to be out here shortly

01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:11.400
is the absolute disruption and really foundational base set of language and prompt that's going

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:17.000
to allow for more complex primitives to be built or meadows as Sasha was saying, right?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.000
So, I'm super excited.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.520
I'm super thrilled.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:24.680
And I just want to thank all of you for an amazing panel today and bullish on the next

01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:25.680
five years.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:28.200
I think we're going to continue to do really great things.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:32.200
There's going to be a lot of noise as always, but I just want to thank each and every one

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:37.400
of you, Claire, Ina, Sasha and Sam, amazing session.

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:39.680
Thank you for joining and to all of the attendees, right?

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.840
A big, big, big, thank you for all of you who have stayed with us for the full hour and

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:48.400
have been a part of this and to UNIC for hosting us today.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:49.400
Thanks, everybody.

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:51.800
Thank you so much.

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800
Thank you so much.

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:54.880
This was really great.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:55.880
Thank you so much.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:09.960
Thank you for having me.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:27.960
Thank you.
