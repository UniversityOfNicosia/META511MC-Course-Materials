1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,800
All right.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,000
Hey, GM, GM, everybody.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,980
Thank you for joining us and welcome to Meta 511, an NFT

4
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,520
panel discussion on crypto art and one of ones.

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
A huge thank you to our host, Yoonik, for including the session

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
in their ongoing series on web 3.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
I'm pleased to be joined by Sasha Styles, Claire Silver, Ina

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,080
Moja, and Sam Strad.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,240
But before we get started, OK, there's a bit of lag here,

10
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,200
but we're going to try laboring on.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,520
So first of all, a reminder.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
OK.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
All right, let's give this a shot again.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,240
So reminder, if you're attending,

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,000
you can ask questions in the on chat or on Twitter

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,120
using hashtag NFT Q&A. So the topic of today

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,600
is really around crypto art and one of ones.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,840
And why is this topic important?

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,120
And one of ones are the NFT equivalent

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,400
of a unique painting or photograph.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,240
They're usually owned by a single individual.

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,440
Placing of one of one with a notable collector

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,920
institution or fund in the NFT world

24
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,680
is as important as it is with works

25
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,240
in the traditional art world.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
So provenance and provability often

27
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,760
become a very important aspect.

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,880
And especially when you play that to the digital world,

29
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,360
you have provability and you also

30
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,560
have the provable scarcity aspect.

31
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
And a classic case in the traditional world

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,600
would be the Salva Carmundi by Leonardo da Vinci,

33
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
supposedly by Leonardo, which sold as high as $450 million.

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,360
But if you look at the initial certification,

35
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,640
it was done by a world-renowned gallery.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,240
But again, it shows you that it is an imprecise art at best.

37
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,400
And that's where the blockchain comes into be.

38
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,680
So I'm very, very happy and thrilled to be here

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,960
with four tremendous guests.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,480
Sam Spratt, Sasha Styles, Claire Silver, Inamoja.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,000
And we're going to get into a little bit of the discussion

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,480
on why one of one art is relevant.

43
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,320
But before we do that, I'd like each of them

44
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,440
to introduce themselves and maybe spend two to three minutes

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,800
kind of introducing a little bit about who they are.

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,200
So I'm going to start with Claire.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,320
Claire, why don't you start and kick us off here.

48
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,200
Hey, good morning.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,400
I will do my best to do that.

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,080
Hope everybody is having a great day.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,120
I'm Claire Silver.

52
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm an AI collaborative artist.

53
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,000
And I do a lot of work with exhibitions

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,560
and sort of curating contests for AI art

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,520
and hoping people sort of push the boundaries

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,840
into other mediums, like film, video games, music, et cetera.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,880
Very exciting time to be working with AI as an artist.

58
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,960
And I'm also a co-founder of A2, which

59
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,160
is a collective for emerging artists

60
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,600
to help get them some visibility.

61
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,280
We did an exhibition of their work at Basel last year

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,480
and won in New York as well.

63
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,800
So that's me.

64
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Hey, thanks, Claire.

65
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,800
You know, over to you.

66
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,600
I'm with the one.

67
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm Ina Moja.

68
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,160
I'm a visual cook-green, which is a three-for-good organization.

69
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,360
Thanks, Ina.

70
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,720
Sasha, over to you.

71
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,400
Hi.

72
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm actually going to break the trend

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,120
and put my camera on to say hi to everyone.

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,680
Thanks so much for having all of us here.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,320
This is a really wonderful group.

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,200
So just by way of a quick introduction,

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,600
again, my name is Sasha.

78
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm a first-generation, comic, Mongolian-American poet,

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,800
an artist, as well as an AI researcher.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,480
And I work mainly at the intersection of text and technology.

81
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
I'm a lifelong writer and poet.

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,600
And really, my main areas of focus these days

83
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,880
are generative literature and language art,

84
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,000
and, of course, blockchain and poetics.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm particularly interested in the resonances

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,800
between poetry and technology and considering poetry as code.

87
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Poetry is a kind of ancient data storage system.

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,240
Along with all the conceptual implications

89
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,960
that poetry can bring into this web3 world of digital ownership

90
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,600
and provenance and preservation.

91
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,600
In 2021, I actually published my first book, which

92
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,840
is a collection of hybrid poetry and artwork.

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,000
And it's called technology.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,200
And I actually have it right here.

95
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,760
And it's all about what it means to be human in a nearly post-human era.

96
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,680
And I wrote this book with a non-human co-author, an AI-powered

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,680
alter-ego, a text generator, rooted in GPT-2 and GPT-3,

98
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,800
just an ancestor of chat GPT, who's

99
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,000
been getting a lot of attention lately.

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,200
And I've been working with this text generator

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,720
and customizing it since 2018.

102
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
I am very grateful to say that technology, my book,

103
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,760
has been praised and welcomed not just by poets,

104
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,440
but also by the tech community and the AI world

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,760
and by futurists and visionaries, such as Ray Kurtzpile, which

106
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,440
has really meant a lot to me.

107
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,240
I am very wedded to physical books as a lifelong writer.

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,560
Books are very near and dear to me.

109
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,440
But I'm also very interested in publishing innovations,

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,200
and especially what web3 promises for writers like myself, not

111
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,720
just artists, but writers and poets.

112
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,360
And I'm very interested in looking

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,040
at how I can use blockchain, protocol, and different mediums

114
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,480
to manifest my poetry in different ways.

115
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,400
And I've had a lot of fun over the past few years

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
getting to publish my poems in various experimental formats

117
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,040
by places like FXHASH and PONTOM and 50 Gateway,

118
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,880
and objects.

119
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,280
And I even sold an AI-powered poem last year at Christie's,

120
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,360
which still is sort of unbelievable to me.

121
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,720
And last but not least, I wanted to just say that I am also

122
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,400
co-founder of a group called Diverseverse, which

123
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,440
is a literary gallery dedicated to crypto poetry and really

124
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,480
NFT literature at large.

125
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,920
We are dedicated to exploring the ideas that poetry is art,

126
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,440
that poetry is also a technology.

127
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,800
And that language really shouldn't have any limits

128
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
or any boundaries.

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,760
And we've been working on a lot of really exciting projects

130
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,520
that are coming up this year, which I'm excited to share.

131
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,360
Thanks.

132
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,520
Thank you, Sasha.

133
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,760
Sam, last but not least.

134
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,080
Hey, good morning, everyone.

135
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,520
Man, thank you for having us.

136
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,800
This is really special.

137
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,400
Bharat, really good to be with you.

138
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,520
And all three of you are just extremely talented and thoughtful

139
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
women.

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,840
It's an honor to be alongside you.

141
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,080
I started out as an oil painter.

142
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,840
And I would study the technique of the old master's

143
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
feet of horror Rubens.

144
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,840
But around 12 years ago, I discovered

145
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,640
a digital tablet.

146
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,120
And then I pretty much spent the rest of the time from then

147
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,520
until now, trying to figure out how

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,520
I take the warmth, the flaws, the attempt of the medium

149
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,600
that I started with, and how to translate it

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,640
into this space that we actually use and operate

151
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,080
primarily today.

152
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,560
My early gigs were a staff illustrator for tech blogs.

153
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,960
I was making 20 bucks in illustration.

154
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,840
I transitioned that into a pretty solid career

155
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
doing album covers for Kid Cudi, You've Done a Glover,

156
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
Logic, working on games like Borderlands and Red Dead

157
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,240
Redemption.

158
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,160
But in that arc, in that 10 years that I

159
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:57,120
was spent building this, I was creating other people's worlds.

160
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,600
And a few years ago, I had this very fascinating,

161
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,880
but honestly, rather brutal series of events

162
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:11,000
kind of unseat me, untether me from that process.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,520
I noticed that in creating all of this and stacking

164
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
a client list and chasing the commissions from each of them,

165
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,800
that I had become rather abstracted

166
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,480
from the idea of what an artist is supposed to be.

167
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,760
And there is this strange sense of decay

168
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,720
in that of this prior iteration that I had spent and dedicated

169
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,160
my whole life to.

170
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,240
And there was something a few years ago

171
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,920
that in me, I felt I got to make my own world.

172
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,440
I have to say my own thing.

173
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
I had lived this path of a mimic, almost,

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,520
of being the kind of person or artist I needed to be for every job

175
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,200
or project or artist that came my way.

176
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,800
And something about this space when I started creating

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,560
my series, Lucy, felt like, oh my god, everyone else

178
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,800
is doing this too.

179
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,160
They all have their own version of it,

180
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,520
whatever kind of person they are.

181
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,400
It doesn't matter if they're an artist or a collector

182
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,600
or a platform builder or an engineer.

183
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,760
There's a lot of people here who felt that sense of decay.

184
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
Like they were missing the growth part of life.

185
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,240
They were in the dissociative part of it.

186
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,400
And Lucy, the series of episodic paintings

187
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,040
that I've created is about that.

188
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,520
It's about taking our first steps again of trying anew.

189
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,720
And within this, I think there's something

190
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,720
about 101 art in particular that I feel

191
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,880
I spent my whole life trying to make covers and facades

192
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,800
and advertisements that would pop off the shelf

193
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,920
to try to grab as many people as possible through their noise.

194
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,280
And in that process, I was very alone, very isolated,

195
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
trying to do that.

196
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,720
And here, there's none of that during this year

197
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
that I studied this space.

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,680
I've just been creating.

199
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,760
We get to kind of just do as we please make what we feel.

200
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:29,040
And these feelings, no matter how over earnest or melodramatic,

201
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,600
only a single person needs to see it.

202
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
That's one of one.

203
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,240
It's person to person.

204
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Only a single individual needs to feel the frequency

205
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,080
that you're on.

206
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:45,080
From my 10 years of a career, that is such a powerful seismic

207
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,080
shift in how I create and how I deliver art.

208
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,360
Where a 101 piece of art is capable of holding a rather sacred

209
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,880
bond that this individual story and the source of it

210
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
can kind of stack or multiply across the ledger

211
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,080
as other people bid on it and gets eventually collected

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,720
by another individual.

213
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,520
There's a story right in that.

214
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,360
But it's once that individual thing

215
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,720
has transferred that the soloed-off atomized portion of it

216
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
starts becoming collective.

217
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,640
That the collector can kind of breathe new life through it,

218
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,040
evangelize it, spread it, meme it, elevate it in a way,

219
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,200
far beyond the source of its own creation.

220
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,520
Your work starts to collide and curate alongside other artists,

221
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,600
like everyone here on the stage.

222
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,680
The medium starts to blend and overlap.

223
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,200
And yet, we as individuals are still

224
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,800
like codified on chain back to our origin points.

225
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,680
I love that.

226
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,240
I can't really begin to express how powerful that has been

227
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,080
over the last year of creating this project.

228
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,600
That freedom of movement to remove

229
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
these increments that separate what I think in the past

230
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,040
maybe seemed disparate elements of humanity.

231
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,360
Just don't feel like that here.

232
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,480
It's a playground to kind of tap into who you are,

233
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,920
but also see what you can become when you start playing together.

234
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,640
It's amazing.

235
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
Hey, thanks, Sam.

236
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,120
Hey, I want to stick with you for a second, right?

237
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,880
Could you tell us a little bit more about Lucy's backstory

238
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,800
or the origin story, if you would,

239
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,360
and how alternate reality shaped the body of work?

240
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,480
Maybe give us a little bit more of that sort of parallel universe

241
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,840
as you see it and how that sort of plays a part in your artwork.

242
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,760
Yeah, absolutely.

243
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,880
So Lucy was really born from this catalytic series

244
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,840
of events in my own life that all kind of happened simultaneously

245
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,040
three or four years ago.

246
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,240
This was in depth, some relationships ending

247
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,720
that distasteed my own path as an artist that I mentioned,

248
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,000
that feeling of waking up from a haze of something

249
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
that maybe barely rhymes with life,

250
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,200
both in art and itself.

251
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,720
I discussed about as many aspects as you could imagine

252
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,760
in my work, in my actions, in my knowledge, in my appearance.

253
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,480
I was a very sad stack at this point in time,

254
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,800
had a lot of feelings.

255
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
But I think I needed that violence.

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,720
And as I began regaining my footing,

257
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,120
I was looking for answers and that came in the form of reading

258
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,280
as many great stories and novels as possible.

259
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,480
Seeing how these things connected to each other,

260
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,240
going back in time and starting to see truths in the most recent ones

261
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,600
that were found and older ones that were found in the most ancient ones,

262
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,560
these questions that I'd been asking myself now,

263
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,120
after everything unraveled, were asked and answered like millions of times

264
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,080
over thousands of years.

265
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,840
And so I would be journaling my own wanders, my own lives,

266
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:11,120
and I would see the same thing happening in books,

267
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,160
rhyming patterns of both my successes, but also my failures.

268
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,200
And the thing that got me stuck in a more dissociative cycle for a while,

269
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,520
that I started to see this space really unlocked to when you put discipline

270
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,440
towards bending your own arc, to taking ownership agency over your own actions,

271
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,600
it starts to pull you out of it.

272
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,800
And Lucy making these paintings,

273
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,560
they are markers.

274
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,280
They're like markers of progress about the discovery of not being alone

275
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,200
as you try to regain your footing.

276
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,640
And I guess just as much so, they're like markers of our narrative of progress,

277
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:02,120
of the moments and the story that were like right for ourselves,

278
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,720
if I had managed to live my whole life and absolutely miss so many things,

279
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
maybe I'm a little bit of a dishonest narrator for myself,

280
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:17,280
and that it might be rather interesting if reality starts being

281
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,360
others around us reflecting back at us to make something that feels more solid.

282
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,720
And that feeling that I think Lucy came from is what I've witnessed

283
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,720
across pretty much every person I've come to meet and know and even love

284
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and appreciate in this space, like Lucy, each one of these paintings

285
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,120
is like a carefully crafted joke at my own expense.

286
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,320
And they pull from prominent origin, salamat of teachings, modern day New York,

287
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:55,480
but it's mostly just when you start alone, it's not real.

288
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,680
It only gets real when you start bouncing off everyone else.

289
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
I love that Sam.

290
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,000
So art imitating life at its truest sense.

291
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,040
Hey, Claire, let me shift over to you.

292
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,480
You've described yourself as a collaborative AI artist.

293
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,040
Tell us about the impact of AI on your work.

294
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,000
I know you've got a tremendous body of work.

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,800
You've been an evangelist for AI art for as long as I can remember,

296
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
but would love to get your point of view and perspective.

297
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,360
Yeah, totally.

298
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Well, so the impact of AI on my work, gosh, there's a lot.

299
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,720
One of the first things it did was it inspired me with questions

300
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,960
of what it means to be human and what art is.

301
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,560
Those were sort of the first.

302
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,880
And also, this is pretty common knowledge, but I have a chronic illness.

303
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,080
And so thinking about AI solving for some of those issues that humanities had forever,

304
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:55,280
like chronic illnesses, et cetera, and what we might celebrate when those parts of the

305
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:00,360
hero's journey are overcome, so to speak, what other things we might find to tell stories

306
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,720
about and celebrate fascinated me.

307
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,440
So I've been able to use AI to explore those questions in a way that I don't think I would

308
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,000
have necessarily been able to do alone.

309
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,760
And then it also augments skill, which allows me to better represent those ideas in questions,

310
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,360
I think, feel a lot freer.

311
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,760
So it's a lot like, feels like play in a way, feels like freedom of exploration, like when

312
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,560
you were a kid, you know, it's something I haven't experienced since then outside of

313
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
this.

314
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,880
So maybe why I'm such an evangelist.

315
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,840
I also think, you know, speaking of collaborative, it reflects what you ask for.

316
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,440
So if you ask for something very simple and generic, that's what it'll give you.

317
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:47,400
I try to ask it for kind of abstract notions of connection, and it gives that to me.

318
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,480
So it feels a lot like talking to a friend for me, collaborative, right?

319
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,800
Feels like talking to a friend that never gets tired of talking to you and learns you

320
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,560
better with every word that you speak to it.

321
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,040
So it does feel collaborative.

322
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:07,600
And it also encourages me to learn more because my prompting utilizes a lot of art terminology

323
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,440
and art history.

324
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,760
For example, using luminism as an art movement in the work will change the aesthetic.

325
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,480
If you mix up a bunch of other prompts, you can combine all of these disparate ideas into

326
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,280
something that feels really new.

327
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,160
And so I've had to learn a lot more of that.

328
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,280
And then photography, learning lenses and apertures and shutter speeds and lighting conditions and

329
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
then mixing all of those into a prompt.

330
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,760
It's really encouraged me to go deeper.

331
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:39,160
And then, yeah, lastly, I'd say it's helped me know myself a lot better too because with

332
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,200
AI, as you know, you can iterate a huge body of work very quickly.

333
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,600
So I've created hundreds of thousands of pieces over the course of, let's say a year.

334
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,440
I've been doing this for a few years, but I'll curate it down to five or so to share

335
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,920
and maybe one to mint every three months or less.

336
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
And so you really develop your taste, you really develop your aesthetic, your motifs,

337
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,640
your patterns, your symbols, you figure yourself out with it.

338
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,080
And I don't think that I would have done that either without using AI in my work.

339
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:17,880
So I think it's made me a better NFT artist as well because the ones you resonate with

340
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,960
most and it's hard when you have a huge body of work to know what you're going to do with

341
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,600
that scarce opportunity.

342
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,880
So I feel like it's helped me know myself more as well.

343
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Thank you, Claire.

344
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
For those of you who don't know, Claire is my AI whisperer.

345
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,320
So when I'm trying to create with my two left-thumbs prompt-generated art, she is someone

346
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,040
I bounce my ideas off of.

347
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,920
But hey, let's shift over to you.

348
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,400
Your work is at the intersection of societal consciousness and digital art, which I think

349
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,520
is a very interesting sort of crossover area.

350
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,440
Could you tell us a bit more about Code Green and how that impacts your work as an artist?

351
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,120
Yes, absolutely.

352
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,840
So we funded Code Green.

353
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,000
We started working on it in early 2021 and it took us a whole year before we launched

354
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,480
it because I'm a traditional activist.

355
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:22,640
And so I wanted, I saw the blockchain as this incredible way to disrupt traditional philanthropy.

356
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:29,280
And our aim is to use the power of art and, you know, what, and tech to engage people

357
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,280
in taking actions for either the planet or having an impact.

358
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:39,480
And so for me as an artist, I've been using my voice for social gender and climate justice

359
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,040
for the past 15 years and my art has always been intertwined with my activism.

360
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:53,400
And either my photography, my films or my music, I always try to share messages that

361
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,400
to be a messenger, to speak for people who doesn't, whose voice doesn't resonate as far

362
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,280
as mine could.

363
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:12,160
And so when we started this, as an artist, I saw the space as something remarkably innovative

364
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:19,320
and giving the power to artists is giving the power to the space to create an incredible

365
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:26,440
shift because our artists have always been tied to the biggest revolutions and evolution

366
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,720
of humanity.

367
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,360
And so for me, I felt like, okay, I have two hats and what I'm going to be doing in here

368
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,000
because as an artist, I can share my art and experiment with the technology.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,840
But as an activist and a builder, I could really create a movement that goes beyond the space

370
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:57,240
and that bridges a gap with the digital community and real life community all over, around the

371
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,240
world.

372
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:07,280
So what we do is we create a link between collectors, communities, artists and builders

373
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,920
with different SDGs action.

374
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:20,640
So we partnered with the UN SDG to do that and support the 17 SDGs and just try to make

375
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,280
the world a better space.

376
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:29,960
This is something that is not rooted in naivete or, you know, I'm not naive from where I

377
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
come from.

378
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:39,480
I know that working in some type of way can get you some places and that there is hope

379
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,440
if you build and build and believe in what you're doing.

380
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:53,200
And so it took me a whole year before sharing my minting, my first artwork because I was

381
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,080
busy building this good green and trying to create something that was not really in the

382
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,480
space and was not really what I was doing outside of the space.

383
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,760
So I had to find a balance experiment with different things.

384
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:14,840
And after a year we donated over two million dollars to organizations and people and really

385
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:22,840
making an impact but also bringing awareness and showing people in the web three space

386
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:30,160
that your voice count and that you can as an individual make a strong impact and have a

387
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:38,960
say in what is happening in the world and also that's what the shift in governance means

388
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,440
to me.

389
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:50,080
And so yeah, it has been a very exciting and rewarding experience and learning as well.

390
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Thank you, you know.

391
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,880
I love the tagline from your website, right?

392
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
So the digital revolution for social evolution.

393
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
I think that's super powerful.

394
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,800
So thanks for that.

395
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,520
And hey, Sasha, over to you.

396
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,480
You've been described as a transhuman artist and an AI empowered poet, right?

397
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Can you tell us and double click on Metapoetry?

398
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,120
Yeah, absolutely.

399
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,360
And by the way, I'm just sitting here so fascinated by what everyone's been saying.

400
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,400
I feel so grateful to get to hear more about the really beautiful practices and thought

401
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
processes behind what you're all doing.

402
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,240
So yes, my Metapoetry.

403
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,000
Well, as I said before, I've been writing my entire life and I started writing in a little

404
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,880
bit more of a traditional sense, but I think that's evolved really over time.

405
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,320
I've always been really interested, I think, fundamentally in the idea of something called

406
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,400
the R's Poetica.

407
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,880
So literally R's Poetica translates to the art of poetry.

408
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,160
It's this consideration of poetry as an art form.

409
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:56,200
And in terms of genre, R's Poetica is actually formally about poems that are exploring the

410
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,480
role of poetry and poets in society.

411
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,880
They're poems that are really about the poet's relationship to language, the poet's relationship

412
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,520
to the act of writing.

413
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,200
And to me, I just find this so deeply, deeply fascinating from a conceptual point of view.

414
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:16,640
And it's just fun for me to think about the idea of poetry that is self-aware or poetry

415
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,680
that is about poetry.

416
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,360
I think there's a lot that really intrigues me about that and relates to meta in a way

417
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,560
that I'll get to in a second.

418
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,960
But my first sustained project in this area was actually something called R's Poetica

419
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
Cybernetica.

420
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,440
So looking at poetry not just as an art form, but as a technological invention, kind of

421
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,720
like bringing together R's Poetica and R's Technica in the way.

422
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:46,760
And thinking through the poetics of networked imagination, kind of like Sam was referring

423
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:52,360
to before, thinking about the poetics of intelligence systems and the poetics of technology and

424
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,280
communications in a larger sense.

425
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,800
So I think a lot of that is really baked into much of what I do.

426
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,880
And it's just always propelled me to think of poetry not just in the conventional sense

427
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:11,160
of poems that you read off a piece of paper or that you read in the New Yorker or whatever,

428
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,400
but poems in a more expansive sense, poetry in a more experimental and conceptual understanding

429
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,960
of that term.

430
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,680
So when I say things like meta poetry, I'm really thinking of meta within the history

431
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:33,080
of poetry, the poetic tradition and thinking of it more in the sense of the Greek understanding

432
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:40,960
of meta as after, beyond, above, something that's kind of bigger and more all-encompassing.

433
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:47,320
And again, that kind of refers back to this notion of poetry as really being something

434
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,200
that is self-aware and something that helps us kind of understand ourselves and that activates

435
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
something.

436
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:01,000
It's not just storytelling, it's not just words on a page or words spoken into the air.

437
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,200
It's actually kind of a software program that when it's deployed is actually making something

438
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
happen.

439
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,200
It's very interested in kind of the mechanisms that surround the context by which these things

440
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,080
can happen.

441
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,800
And when I use terms like transhumanism or if I'm described as a transhuman poet, that

442
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:27,520
really I think has to do with the idea of transhumanism as a consideration of how advanced

443
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,240
technologies can really enhance the human condition.

444
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,920
And I mentioned before my first book and a lot of my practice is really about this.

445
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:41,800
It's about what it means to be human in an age that is really dominated by machines and

446
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,480
non-human intelligences in lots of ways.

447
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,240
And so within that context, I'm thinking a lot about poetry as a technology that has

448
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,720
enhanced our human experience and our human condition for more than thousands of years

449
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,000
and kind of creating a through line and thinking about how advancing and speculative technologies

450
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,840
like artificial intelligence, large language models like GPT-3 and soon GPT-4 and how things

451
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,200
like text to image tools can continue to expand and enhance our imagination and empower us

452
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,760
as human beings to understand ourselves in new ways.

453
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:25,920
So yeah, that's I think that probably is a pretty good summation of all that and also

454
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,920
explains why I'm really happy to be here in the web 3 space because a lot of these considerations

455
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:39,240
are very, I think are very fringe still in the world of poetry in the literary establishment

456
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:43,040
in the kind of more conventional writing communities.

457
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:49,720
The idea of something like bringing in an AI to co-author a piece of text is still anathema

458
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
in a lot of ways.

459
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,640
So I think it's been really important and really, you know, it's been very essential,

460
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,640
I think, to a lot of my practice to be able to explore some of these ideas and experiment

461
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,160
with these tools in the kind of very experimental and open-minded community that we have here

462
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,240
that's been, you know, fundamental, I think, to a lot of what I'm doing.

463
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,200
So I'm grateful for that.

464
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
Thanks, Asha, for that.

465
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:25,920
I love how you're all kind of linking together, you know, in your own way, AI, blockchain technology

466
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,080
and humanism, right?

467
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,440
I mean, it's all imbued in everything that each and every one of you have been describing

468
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,480
up to this point, which is pretty impressive.

469
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,080
I want to go to some general questions now for the panel, right?

470
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,080
And we'll start with you, Sam.

471
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,200
We have, we've been hearing and seeing a lot about open editions of late, right?

472
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,920
Almost drowning out one of one art.

473
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,880
Do you see this as a positive and something that's a sustainable trend or is it something

474
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,720
that we should be alarmed about?

475
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
Yeah.

476
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah.

477
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,320
There are some undeniable, beautiful upsides, right?

478
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,280
It's great to see many people enter into an artist's ecosystem affordably.

479
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:14,960
It's great to see artists make great payouts when the individual high-level 101 collectors

480
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,400
have either honed their taste to the point that they're kind of just after a few specific

481
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,840
artists or are just more price sensitive than they were back in the bull market.

482
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,800
And it's also just kind of a nice way to support artists.

483
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,280
These things are obvious, right?

484
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:37,840
There is the downsides that are just as obvious, flooding your own supply, these burn and redeem

485
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,200
games that may or not have exactly a follow-up plan.

486
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,640
But I don't really look at any of these new meadows rather with scorn or praise.

487
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,440
I do them as things to be studied.

488
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,640
You can either learn from them through participation or through studying.

489
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,280
And for this particular one, I've chosen to learn from observation mostly because I already

490
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,880
know where I'm going and it doesn't include this, right?

491
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,400
Lucy is an episodic story.

492
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:15,840
I've been working on it and it's arc for a long time.

493
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,680
The next piece in this arc is a couple weeks away.

494
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,120
The project after that is coming later this spring.

495
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,840
Doing that kind of puts me away from being reactive to whatever the game at the moment

496
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,600
is sometimes even at my own expense, right?

497
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:45,720
So to try to create work, I learned something in the creation process that usually demands

498
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,880
time out of me.

499
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:51,520
Time is something that I think about a lot.

500
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:58,040
The potential rewards for engaging in this particular wave, the risks of derailing design

501
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,960
that I put in motion for the next year, is just a little too high for me.

502
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,880
It feels like something that could maybe fill some coffers now, have under maybe the branding

503
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,280
or guys of accessibility.

504
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:18,920
But if I'm being very honest, it feels too disposable and interchangeable in this iteration.

505
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,520
There's something missing in it.

506
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,240
Creating work to be discarded for other work to be discarded.

507
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,520
Conceptually, this just honestly just does not align with my own value.

508
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't fault anyone for participating in it.

509
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
That might be my own weakness, right?

510
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,800
Perhaps I hold art as too sacred because releasing this work with Lucy, it's changed my life

511
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,440
so drastically.

512
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,880
I hope every artist in this wave will take these drips and roll it into creating great

513
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,600
work, have a mess of new supporters that it dilutes nothing and it only opens each of

514
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,880
them to a bigger world.

515
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,760
But for my own goals, which are perhaps outside of that, I think time will agree with this

516
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,840
instinct.

517
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,040
In either direction, and maybe this is more important than anything, both in my desire

518
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,360
to skip it and what could be lost in that, and in others who participate in it, either

519
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,600
as an artist or as a collector.

520
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:21,400
Above all, I just think it's very important that everyone remember to take personal responsibility

521
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
for whatever may come.

522
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,480
Thanks, Sam.

523
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,840
Be thoughtful is what I pick up, right?

524
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,760
Be very thoughtful about what you do here.

525
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,840
You know, yeah, you know, over to you.

526
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,360
Same question.

527
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,520
I think that open edition can be great ways for artists to give an affordable access to

528
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,280
their work to anyone who'd like to own it.

529
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:50,040
I think people can experiment and play around because this industry is really young, so it's

530
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:57,240
good to play an experiment as long as the expectations are reasonable on both sides.

531
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,400
And it's art.

532
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,920
There's no road map there.

533
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,160
It's art and it's enough.

534
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,120
So it depends on why you do it.

535
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,040
It's important to be intentional.

536
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:17,200
Like Sam said, it's important to be thoughtful in both ways for either the artist and the

537
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,200
collectors.

538
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,520
And I haven't even done an edition yet.

539
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:30,560
I'm currently working on my first edition, so I don't picture open editions for myself,

540
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,320
but I can see why some artists do it.

541
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,760
I've bought some open editions because I really love the art and I've always wanted to own

542
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,360
one of the art from a specific artist.

543
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:50,920
But I've never sold an NFT, except from what I created any NFT that I bought.

544
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,400
I've never sold any ever yet.

545
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,080
So I'm not a flavor.

546
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,600
I'm not an investor.

547
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,320
An art lover, so my perspective comes from that stance.

548
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,600
Love that, love that, Ina.

549
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
Clear over to you.

550
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,840
Same question.

551
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Yeah, sorry.

552
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,840
I had to find the unmute button there.

553
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
Yeah.

554
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
So this is a tough one.

555
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:19,600
Open editions are a scary thing, I think, for a lot of artists because of scarcity, right?

556
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,720
And worries that collectors will be hurt by doing that.

557
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,560
I thought about it a long time and I actually did an open edition myself.

558
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,600
But it was in a very specific context.

559
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,560
It was after I'd been getting a lot of comments that people were lamenting that they couldn't

560
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:42,720
collect a piece because my one of one floor went so out of range for most people and my

561
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
collections were also moving out of range.

562
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,080
Around the same time, NFT gateway reached out and offered to do a solo drop for an open

563
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,080
edition.

564
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,360
So I agreed, but what I did was I structured the drop to reward my collection holders and

565
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,440
my one of one holders.

566
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,160
And I also made it the shortest time window that you could with NFT gateway.

567
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:06,000
So that would be a 10 minute drop.

568
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,320
And I also sold a one of one sort of in conjunction.

569
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,920
So there was still a tier of that sort of game theory of scarcity involved.

570
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,120
So I think thoughtful is the good word for that.

571
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:22,360
I will say that open editions do build a broad community, which is always good.

572
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:27,960
And a broad community also means more opportunities for you as your audience grows and your reach

573
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,240
grows.

574
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,240
Theoretically more value to your scarce one of one work as well as long as you follow

575
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,720
an open edition with scarcity and as long as you don't do them repeatedly or for an

576
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,480
hour or a day or whatever long time window.

577
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,560
I think that there is a way to structure them so that it won't harm you and can be a good

578
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,600
thing, but you have to be very, very intentional about it.

579
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
Thanks, Claire.

580
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,160
So be thoughtful and use it as a leverage point for building community.

581
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Great points.

582
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,600
Sasha, last but not least.

583
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:11,840
Yeah, so I actually really am interested in open editions as they kind of relate to the

584
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,680
history of literature and publishing.

585
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,280
I kind of mentioned before I am very intrigued in sort of thinking about blockchain within

586
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,920
the context of historical publishing innovations.

587
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,880
And open editions actually have a really important role in the history of literature in the

588
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,280
form of broadsides.

589
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:41,160
So when we were kind of moving away from handwritten literature during the advent of

590
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,920
printing press after Gutenberg's invention of movable type and all that, poetry broadsides

591
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:53,080
actually became a very important medium for cultural transmission.

592
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:58,960
Broad size in general, which are basically just kind of cheap readily, printable readily

593
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:06,000
available pieces of paper with text written on them, became a really essential way for

594
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,040
public announcements to be made and for poets to share their work and actually for songwriters

595
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,480
and lyricists to share ballads.

596
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,320
And there's just hundreds of years ago, so obviously quite different than what we're

597
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,800
talking about here, but I can't help thinking about open editions and editions in general

598
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,720
kind of in that context of the broadside.

599
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,560
And in fact, I've done quite a few projects that really invoke using blockchain as sort

600
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,560
of a bespoke printing press in homage to someone like Gutenberg in which we can create

601
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,080
many editions.

602
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:43,480
Sometimes they're all the same, sometimes they are algorithmically generated to be

603
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,840
slightly different, but this idea of being able to print something in multiple copies

604
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,520
and then share it with a broad audience I think is really instrumental in the history

605
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:00,400
of the dissemination of information and in turn the empowerment of the public and of

606
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,320
readers through that technological step forward.

607
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,680
So I think from that sense, I really like playing with the idea of what an open edition

608
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,680
represents.

609
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,240
I actually have an open edition right now with super chief Nifty Gateway, which is up

610
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:23,560
for another day or so, and I'm kind of interested in how it's being received and how people

611
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,880
are kind of engaging with it.

612
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
That's all very interesting to me.

613
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,680
And again, really like thinking about what it means to have a piece of work available

614
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,120
in that sense and at the same time have a whole roster of one of ones that do something

615
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
very different.

616
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:46,880
And I think one of the reasons I'm in this space is because I do see the potential for

617
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,520
web3 and for all the technologies that we're discussing to really help writers stand up

618
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,280
for the value of their work in a way that we haven't been able to before.

619
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:02,800
I think there is sort of an implicit understanding that writing, that literature, because it

620
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:10,160
can be easily reproduced and printed, that it's worth less than fine art, for example.

621
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,360
And one of the things that I'm very interested in personally and that I'm also working for

622
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:20,360
at the verse verse, which I mentioned earlier, is this idea that poems really have intrinsic

623
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:26,920
value and deserved to sort of be considered as inherently valuable alongside art in a

624
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,360
way that they haven't in the past.

625
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:34,040
And I think that that, in that sense, the role of one of ones is really critical.

626
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,640
Thinking about the ability of a poet to take a single poem and not just distributed as

627
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,600
a broadside or not just distributed within a printed collection of other poems, not just

628
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:50,160
distributed within a literary journal or within another magazine where that poem is packaged

629
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,480
together with hundreds of other pages of material.

630
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,080
But for that poem to be able to stand on its own, and especially for a poem like that to

631
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:04,720
stand on its own, liberated from between the covers of a book and stand as a one of one,

632
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:12,800
is also very, I think, sort of a new way of thinking about poetry.

633
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,440
So I see both the value for open editions.

634
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,880
I think, again, conceptually they're incredibly interesting and I think they can be very empowering

635
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:26,320
for poets as far as a way to actually make money from writing in a very novel approach.

636
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,800
But I also see the incredible value of one of ones for really kind of planting a flag

637
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,880
for the idea of poems as one of one artworks in their own right.

638
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,720
And again, that's something that I think is very different than the way poems have been

639
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,080
sort of treated in the course of human history.

640
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Thanks, Ash.

641
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,160
I love the way you drew the analogy back to broadside, right?

642
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:58,680
I mean, effectively what was in many ways means and connecting with the people through

643
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:03,320
a means of communication and how you link that back to open editions.

644
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,560
That was pretty powerful.

645
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,200
Good stuff from the panel here.

646
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,200
All right, let's move on to our next question here.

647
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,600
This is an interesting one.

648
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:20,480
You hear, oftentimes, people describe the current art scene, whether it's digital art

649
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,280
photography, whether it's generative, as a little bit of a circle jerk or an echo chamber,

650
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
right?

651
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,240
And then what advice would you have for new artists and also collectors that are entering

652
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,560
the space, right?

653
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,120
What would be some effective approaches for them to engage in the community?

654
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:41,920
And how do we sort of expand and broaden the list of participants?

655
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,600
But Claire, I'll start with you on this one.

656
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,880
Yeah, sure.

657
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,520
So my advice for new artists and maybe collectors too, I hadn't thought about it as much.

658
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,680
But I would say lean into your art, obviously, but then when that starts to slow down, either

659
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:04,480
by your own kind of drive and inspiration kind of cycling or just by lack of engagement,

660
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,080
I would say lean into community building, Twitter spaces, education, that kind of thing.

661
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,480
So it's kind of like a pendulum.

662
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,160
You lean into the interior world and then you lean into engaging with others and helping

663
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,520
them where you can.

664
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,480
And then you lean back into your interior world and you just sort of repeat this pendulum

665
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,360
sort of motion.

666
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,360
And doing that, I think, replenishes your inspiration, but it also builds a following

667
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,760
of friends that are naturally interested in your work, naturally interested in wanting

668
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,160
to support you and be involved in the projects that you'd like to see succeed.

669
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,040
I think that, yeah, swinging sort of back and forth slowly has been very useful for me.

670
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,320
And that's what I would recommend.

671
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,840
Thanks, Claire.

672
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Sam?

673
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:54,640
Yeah, I mean, look, it's an amazing time to be a digital artist right now.

674
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,880
Best time ever I've been doing this for a while.

675
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,800
Maybe it's a little bit harder because the tools are so accessible, sophisticated and

676
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,600
powerful, but I don't know.

677
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:10,120
I just think that's even better because it kind of puts a fire under your ass to pull

678
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,920
something real out of you.

679
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:22,000
As far as advice, man, I would definitely focus on the hard angle personally rather

680
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,960
than anything web-free specific because, I mean, you as an individual are a tiny little

681
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
spark, right?

682
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,080
You've got to nurture it with kindling care, knowledge and resources to make that sucker

683
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,200
grow.

684
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,200
Then you can attract the community to it, right?

685
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,600
You got to start close in to bring a little David White into the conversation.

686
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,520
Get your own house in order before worrying about others.

687
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,960
And for me, that is identify the areas that you struggle with the most.

688
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:02,560
Talking about being a painter here, that might be anatomy, color, light, or cocktail of any

689
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
of these.

690
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:10,720
Just any tension point where you find limiting the kinds of art that you are able to make,

691
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,640
in doing the hard work to learn what it takes to get what's in your head out on the canvas,

692
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,000
or whatever your medium is as fluidly as possible.

693
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,480
It just never shy away from things that you're bad at.

694
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:29,720
You can go infinitely into absolutely everything to find even one small thing to get good at

695
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,560
is a beautiful gift and you should feel no shame in struggling.

696
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:41,240
So long as you're putting time, energy, love, and humility into truly learning it, don't

697
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,240
mess around with pop culture too much.

698
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,720
Find out who you are, be in your mind and body in this world.

699
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,400
Best way to do that is to learn a lot of different things, as much as you possibly can, and to

700
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:59,080
start feeling your own gravity in one direction or another.

701
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:03,160
Because when you do feel that pull, and it can take a long time to get there, but when

702
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,600
you feel it, that's that time.

703
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:12,280
You've got to seize that and start going infinitely into building out that universe of that feeling

704
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:18,440
to go down every single little rabbit hole within it to see what does your mind look like when

705
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,320
you've extracted it out of you.

706
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,120
Don't dabble around and little one-offs here and there.

707
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,120
You're saying it doesn't matter how silly it is.

708
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,840
I paint monkeys, right?

709
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,840
But I really mean it, I really mean it when I make them.

710
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:40,200
I think just try to grow, stay with other artists, be vulnerable with them while being

711
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,400
hungry, share the struggles that you're having as an artist.

712
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,600
You're going to get a lot of vulnerability and return from others.

713
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,440
You mentioned circle jerk.

714
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,560
It's a great term for this because this is not about just being like two people being

715
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,320
sad artists together.

716
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
That's a nightmare.

717
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:03,320
You don't want to be in that little cycle.

718
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,800
You both have to have growth in mind.

719
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,000
These bonds that form from people helping each other push you.

720
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,640
It makes you learn together faster, better, more efficiently.

721
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,040
And in my view personally, most importantly, competitively.

722
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,800
Like that push and pull of different people learning at different paces trying to catch

723
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,920
each other.

724
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,440
It's like we're all just little wolves in the forest playing around with each other.

725
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,440
And it lights this fire in you, this soul to play the game.

726
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,760
Like two of my closest friends, a photographer named Jo-El and Victor Phoosius.

727
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,560
These are friendships that are not just for fun, right?

728
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,280
They're not just, oh, I like you.

729
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,280
How are you feeling?

730
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,280
How did you sleep?

731
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,120
We're here to push each other to help each other grow.

732
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,120
I love that.

733
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:03,440
So focus on the art and build the network and really challenge yourselves.

734
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
Nice one.

735
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:07,720
Over to you.

736
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:13,680
So I think that we have amazing tools to push the boundaries of visual storytelling in poetry

737
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,880
and whatever form of art that you want to share.

738
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,280
And the decentralized nature of this makes it accessible to everyone.

739
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,040
So I think that art is coming into this should experiment, try new things and not be scared

740
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,440
to fail.

741
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,560
And art has the power to transform your dreams into reality and reality into dreams.

742
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,600
So dream bigger and bigger.

743
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,960
Share your work, connect with people, make friends.

744
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,760
You will probably have people who will also hate your work.

745
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:53,320
Deal with that and really, I think that this is a great time to be an artist because there

746
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:59,520
is so much empowerment and there is so much things that you can do from your room.

747
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,400
You don't need to be in an art gallery.

748
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,000
You don't need to be chosen.

749
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,440
You have to choose yourself and you have to choose to put yourself out there and share

750
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,760
what the art that you created for the whole world.

751
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,520
There is a huge potential of connecting with people.

752
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:25,480
And so I think that the fact that there is kind of no limit is super exciting.

753
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:31,880
And it's a moment where more and more artists can share different types of works.

754
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,640
And we're open to it.

755
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:35,680
We're open to receiving it.

756
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:42,400
And we're in this together because it's such a young space that the technology and art

757
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,400
coming together.

758
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,640
And we're all experimenting at the same time.

759
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:55,560
So there's no bad ways because we are kind of learning on the way.

760
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:05,080
And for collectors, I think the same really by what you want, by what speaks to you, by

761
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:12,760
what means something to you and do research and connect with artists and create links.

762
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:19,440
The human links that we are making right now is something that is so, so, so important

763
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,120
and that I cherish every day.

764
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Thanks, Ena.

765
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,640
So really zoom out, right?

766
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,280
I mean, as you said, we're super early and it's about the connections.

767
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,280
Love that.

768
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,840
Hey, Sasha, last but not least again.

769
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:37,760
Yeah, I'm loving all of this.

770
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,960
I guess two things that I would highlight that have been really important for me.

771
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,520
One is that I really think it's important, even though we're in this space that tends

772
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,800
to be so trend driven, I think it's really important to just really follow your own interests

773
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:56,120
and your own obsessions and go where they lead you.

774
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:02,360
I've been working with AI language since about 2018 in earnest.

775
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:11,920
And when I started doing it, nobody was using GPT to write real poetry or anything like that.

776
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,160
And I was definitely trying to take things into workshops and show my friends and got

777
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,120
a lot of very weird reactions.

778
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,240
And I kept doing it because it was really interesting to me.

779
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:27,600
I just thought it was fascinating and I was personally inspired and just exhilarated by

780
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,600
what I was discovering.

781
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:35,640
And lo and behold, fast forward a few years and now chat GPT is taken off and every time

782
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:40,400
I open a newspaper or listen to a podcast, people are talking about AI language and it's

783
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,000
just astonishing.

784
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,560
And I'm really grateful that I stuck to it and I didn't get discouraged in the beginning

785
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:51,320
by the fact that I was starting to share things and was sort of hearing crickets.

786
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:57,120
I think that it's very tempting, especially because the space is so quick and so fast

787
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:00,440
paced and can sometimes feel like a popularity contest.

788
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,760
It does feel like you want to do what seems to be successful.

789
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:10,520
And I would just say just remember that that's not necessarily going to work out well.

790
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,160
I think it's really important that artists go deep into their own fascinations and obsessions

791
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,200
and really just chase them wherever they can go.

792
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,680
And the other thing is that I think participating in the ecosystem is incredibly important.

793
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,160
When I first started minting, I took some time before my first mint to really get to

794
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,720
know some of the different ecosystems and the different platforms and to understand

795
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:40,520
what kinds of art was being minted where and to see where I felt at home.

796
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:45,400
And to really go where I felt like I had genuine relationships with people and I wasn't just

797
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,280
kind of dropping into something unprepared.

798
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,800
And I think over time what's really served me best has been actively and genuinely participating

799
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:59,840
in the ecosystems where I really feel that I belong and that I'm inspired by.

800
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:06,560
And that means not just dropping into mint and to show my work but to actively be involved

801
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,400
in the community to sort of look at what can be done to help build the community, to be

802
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,860
an active participant in collecting works by the artists that I admire, to help onboard

803
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:21,080
new people to the ecosystem, to actively kind of reach out and see if there's people who

804
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,440
are struggling and who want to be part of it.

805
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,760
All those things are really essential to the health of the overall ecosystem.

806
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,720
And ultimately will be beneficial to us all.

807
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:35,600
So I think that's really just kind of like a fundamental thing.

808
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:41,720
It's like table stakes to be part of this is that you really need to be engaged in a really

809
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,760
authentic and meaningful way.

810
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,560
So I think those are the two things that are sort of first and foremost in my mind these

811
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:49,560
days.

812
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,560
Thanks, Sasha.

813
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,680
Be authentic, engage, go deep, right?

814
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,520
And build a community and a network and expand from there.

815
00:53:58,520 --> 00:53:59,520
Love it.

816
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,520
All right.

817
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,160
So we're going to move on to our final question.

818
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,440
And you know, Ina, I'm going to start with you on this one.

819
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,280
So if you could play Nostradamus for a moment and prognosticate, right?

820
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,600
Where do you see one of one digital art five years from now?

821
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:22,200
I think that there is no limit because art is the voice and expression of people.

822
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:27,520
And honestly, I think that it will just be considered art.

823
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:34,920
I'm not even sure that we're going to be using it as digital because in my shilling, many

824
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,920
people have been using digital art as to it's not like real art, but it is.

825
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,000
I think that it will the mediums where art are shared will change and will give access

826
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,080
to digital art into places where they don't exist for now.

827
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,040
And I'm very excited about this because this is a change.

828
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,720
It's a big change and change drives history.

829
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,240
And right now we're living through change so profound.

830
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,840
I feel like we're a moment where what we're doing right now will ship the culture.

831
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,400
And I'm super excited about it.

832
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:14,240
And art has always been used in the past to disrupt the status quo or support humanist

833
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,560
communities because revolution or evolution.

834
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:26,880
I can't wait to see where we will be in five years, but I think that we just started to

835
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:35,600
scratch the surface and it's going so fast that five years and our time is such a whole

836
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,600
world.

837
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,960
So I'm pretty excited to see where we'll be at.

838
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:40,960
Thanks, Ina.

839
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Sasha.

840
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:45,400
Oh, goodness.

841
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:50,760
Well, I'm obviously thinking quite a lot about language.

842
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,600
And I think we're seeing things change almost on a daily basis when it comes to what's possible

843
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,640
with AI powered large language models.

844
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,160
So it's pretty wild even in the short time span.

845
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,920
So to think about where we might be in five years is mind boggling.

846
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:10,960
I do feel like when I take a step back, we are on the cusp of something more profound

847
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,440
and more pivotal than I think most of us realize.

848
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,440
When I think about the work that I'm doing with AI language, I tend to kind of consider

849
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:25,040
it in this larger frame of the history of human language from the development of the

850
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,760
oral tradition to the advent of written language.

851
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,680
And now it kind of feels like we're on the cusp of quite like on the right terminology

852
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:39,480
for it yet, but it's this new kind of generative literature that really embodies all the things

853
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,680
we've been talking about today, but literature and language that's powered by networked imagination

854
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,240
and collective consciousness and powered by community.

855
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:54,880
And I think that that is something that has so much potential to really shift not just

856
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,320
the way, for example, books are made and distributed or anything like that, but really to change

857
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,400
the way that humans think and how we share stories and how we understand ourselves and

858
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,480
our place in the world.

859
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:10,720
So I'm constantly trying to wrap my mind around it.

860
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,640
And related to that, I think that this is the reason I'm so excited about working particularly

861
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,920
with poetry and with language on the blockchain.

862
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:26,200
I think that the rise of poetry and FTS kind of nods to this larger shift towards this

863
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:32,840
new way of communicating and this new kind of understanding ourselves and the rise of

864
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,120
machine code as a new kind of universal language.

865
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:41,480
I think all of that is sort of that play when we're thinking about poetry and generative

866
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:46,480
text and the ability to preserve ideas via blockchain.

867
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:52,480
It's like all part and parcel of sort of the same general idea.

868
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,400
And I think more concretely, like in five years, I really think that we'll have seen

869
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:04,320
the rise of a poetry market, the rise of a new group of poetry collectors who are really

870
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,400
paying attention to poetry in ways that they haven't done before.

871
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,400
I think that we have this very established art market that's been in place for a long

872
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,400
time.

873
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:18,640
And I think as all of this new attention is kind of being shifted towards the role of

874
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:24,160
language in daily human life, not just in poetry, but in text to image generators and

875
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,440
using chat GPT and businesses and all this kind of stuff, I think that language is really

876
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:34,760
going to take on a very different role that cultural, you know, the cultural appreciation

877
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,480
of language will take on a different role.

878
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:43,080
So I think for that reason, no, it's going to be very exciting to watch the increase,

879
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,560
the influx of writers into the web three space.

880
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:50,960
And I think we're going to see a huge shift and a huge paradigm change there very soon.

881
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:51,960
Thank you, Sasha.

882
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:52,960
Clear.

883
00:58:52,960 --> 00:59:00,720
Hey, yeah, so I will go ahead and warn you, I am quote unquote bullish on futuristic

884
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,960
predictions in general.

885
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:05,920
So this is probably going to be a little beyond what most people would envision, but I think

886
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,440
I'm probably right.

887
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:09,440
Five years.

888
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:16,680
So in the last year with AI specifically, we've come a universe, right, in terms of

889
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,120
space from where we were to where we are five years.

890
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:29,200
I see AI assisted creation of personalized metaverse worlds that that probably will be

891
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,760
the component that actually allows the metaverse to take hold like it should as a concept,

892
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:39,080
particularly using AR or VR, which is not developed enough yet.

893
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:44,000
But I know next year, Apple will be dropping some AR glasses that are lightweight and not

894
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,080
particularly ugly.

895
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:49,840
So I imagine we'll have more of a mass adoption moment there and VR will follow.

896
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:54,760
There is a creator named Cuddly salmon, which is a great Twitter handle who I love.

897
00:59:54,760 --> 01:00:02,400
And she is using AI right now to create environments in virtual reality and project them live.

898
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,360
And so basically she puts on her headset and she's in the location that she just created

899
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,840
with staple diffusion.

900
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:14,840
I know there are also programs that now let you project AI images onto 3D environments.

901
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:20,760
So there's like a use case for texturing live, even theoretically, where you could type in

902
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,960
and texture live around you.

903
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,080
So anyway, that's sort of the zoomed in version.

904
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:31,040
The zoomed out version is I think that personalized independent media creation, exactly to your

905
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,040
taste from your bedroom is going to be the trend in five years.

906
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:41,080
And that will go for general NFT and art creation and with AI as well.

907
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:48,400
So art literature, films, video games, music, worlds, experiences, all by individuals or

908
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:51,720
by small groups working together with open source tools.

909
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:57,280
So I think we're going to see the death of some of these larger IP studios when that

910
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,120
happens, but in their place, I think we'll see the rise of creative collectives and independent

911
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,120
artists.

912
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:08,600
And that's going to be empowered by blockchain technology because it establishes provenance.

913
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:14,520
It sort of sorts out a lot of these scary, you know, financial and legal gray areas around

914
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:19,840
selling your work and establishing when it was made and how and all of that automatically.

915
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,680
So I would say start exploring the tools that are out there now and in five years, you'll

916
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,280
be very happy that you did.

917
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,440
Quite bullish.

918
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:30,440
Thank you, Clara.

919
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:31,440
Sam.

920
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:39,800
Damn, Clara, that was a hell of an answer and I agree with so much of that.

921
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:44,240
You know, I'm kind of in an interesting position, right?

922
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:52,480
There is this understandable, but maybe naive battle happening right now around AI art and

923
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,360
of what's authentic of what's human of what has sold.

924
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:59,160
For me, I'm on the other side of this, right?

925
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,280
My art is extractions.

926
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,360
Every single one of these things takes so much time and effort and crafted to make

927
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,280
them sing.

928
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:15,280
They're filled with detail, but the art in what I do is not found in perfect imagery.

929
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:17,840
It's found in the flawed attempt to create it.

930
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:23,240
And it's in that attempt where you will see my weaknesses, my fixation.

931
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:27,080
The areas where my mind has closed and my vision has narrowed.

932
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:32,880
So in my art is labor, like man hours poured into making singular images.

933
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,840
And because of these things, many, many that I speak to assume that I would be an enemy

934
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,340
of AI art, that I would either add to the moral panic of it or plant my feet in and

935
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,440
be scared that it will replace me.

936
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:51,000
But I am much more in the Claire School of Thought than that.

937
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,280
I am neither of these things because to me art is not about image making.

938
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,760
It is really about growth.

939
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,920
I see a multi-generational upheaval towards the creation of art at a massive magnitude.

940
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:12,120
AI is spreading this attempt of image making to everyone, all age ranges, socioeconomic

941
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,760
statuses, image making, and eventually art as we know it is about to become something

942
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:23,480
that every person in the world is capable of and in time will have access to writers

943
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,080
as Sasha suggested will become very powerful for a time.

944
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,840
Thinkers, scholars will become even more powerful as the line blurs further in our thoughts

945
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:38,360
alone serve as inputs for the generation of these world's self-generator worlds that

946
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,360
Claire suggested.

947
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,720
And I see this divide that may be existing right now, like do we preserve our individual

948
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:50,920
humanity or are we going to become part of a collective high mind?

949
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,920
It's neither, right?

950
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,040
They are dialectically coherent.

951
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:55,040
They overlap.

952
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,200
It's both.

953
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,040
It's just what we've talked about with one of one art.

954
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:04,680
You are able to document the source of yourself and your energy and you are also able to engage

955
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,960
in a broader community and world of art.

956
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:14,160
I view these things as very linked and I think that quite frankly, this conversation and

957
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,640
some of the people are in it are going to be leaders and trying to connect the philosophical

958
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:28,840
story and lore of humanity as an individual connecting to the larger unit without losing

959
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:34,160
yourself than just about any other artist I know in this space.

960
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:37,040
I'm very grateful to be up here with you.

961
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:44,960
And to be honest, I'm actually most curious about what Barack would say to this question.

962
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,720
If you're going to go Nostradamus, where do you see this?

963
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,720
Wow.

964
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,160
It's hard for me to follow big brains like y'all, right?

965
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,680
But I will say I'm very, very bullish.

966
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:01,600
I think what you've all shared, which is the human aspect of how we intersect across this

967
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,240
pyramid, if you will, the human aspect, the AI aspect, the art aspect, all coming together.

968
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,520
I think there's a perfect intersection of all of the disruption that will happen.

969
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,720
And I love the fact that it's putting power in the hands of the creator, right?

970
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:26,120
The creatives versus centralized organizations and big technology companies and studios,

971
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:27,120
right?

972
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:35,280
So, Claire's point on disrupting media, disrupting studios, disrupting big tech.

973
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,280
It's powerful.

974
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:44,600
It's the ultimate decentralization, open source movement and transformation so that anybody

975
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:50,040
back to a point that you made, Sam, that even little kids, right, are going to start being

976
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:51,480
very disruptive.

977
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:57,640
But I think what we're seeing with GPT-3 and with GPT-4 that's going to be out here shortly

978
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:11,400
is the absolute disruption and really foundational base set of language and prompt that's going

979
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:17,000
to allow for more complex primitives to be built or meadows as Sasha was saying, right?

980
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
So, I'm super excited.

981
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,520
I'm super thrilled.

982
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:24,680
And I just want to thank all of you for an amazing panel today and bullish on the next

983
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:25,680
five years.

984
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:28,200
I think we're going to continue to do really great things.

985
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:32,200
There's going to be a lot of noise as always, but I just want to thank each and every one

986
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:37,400
of you, Claire, Ina, Sasha and Sam, amazing session.

987
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,680
Thank you for joining and to all of the attendees, right?

988
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,840
A big, big, big, thank you for all of you who have stayed with us for the full hour and

989
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,400
