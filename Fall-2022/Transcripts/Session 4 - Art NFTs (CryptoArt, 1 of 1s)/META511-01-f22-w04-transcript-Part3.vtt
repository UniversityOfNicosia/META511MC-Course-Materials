WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.100
Good morning.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.800
This is Batsoop Yum.

00:25.800 --> 00:37.240
I'm honored to host this photography panel with three legendary photographers, Drift, Priyanka

00:37.240 --> 00:40.040
Patel and Blessing Atas.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.600
I love to collect photography.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.760
I love to collect NFT photography.

00:47.760 --> 00:55.040
I have a photography gallery, an ohm setup, dedicated to photography.

00:55.040 --> 01:02.160
And no one in the audience should take that to mean that I'm an expert in photography.

01:02.160 --> 01:11.680
So I'm going to moderate this panel and I'm here today to learn as much as you all are.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.360
Just because, again, I own a bunch of photography.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.520
It doesn't mean I know exactly what I'm doing in collecting photography.

01:17.520 --> 01:23.080
So I'm hopeful that these three, again, legendary photographers will help us understand better,

01:23.080 --> 01:34.200
a better understand there are what goes behind photography and I'm okay.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.960
Sorry, there was a technical difficulty.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.520
What goes behind their work and how their lives might have changed through NFTs.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.520
So quick intros.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.000
Again, I'm Batsoop Yum.

01:44.000 --> 01:49.040
I'm a collector, but I'm also a part of the 652-19.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.120
I've been collecting this space since, I don't know, 2020 or so.

01:54.120 --> 01:58.240
And again, a big, big fan of photography.

01:58.240 --> 02:05.560
So to start, let's just do quick intros, maybe take a couple minutes each of our guests.

02:05.560 --> 02:09.400
I want to remind everyone first that if you have a question, go ahead and type it in the

02:09.400 --> 02:17.320
chat or you can go onto Twitter and use hashtag NFTQ&A.

02:17.320 --> 02:23.200
That will also send it to the team at UNIC and they will flag it for me.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.560
So again, please feel free to ask questions.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.000
I'm here to learn as much as you all are and let's get started.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.520
Let's start with Priyanka and let's do intros.

02:35.520 --> 02:40.120
Everybody can do, rather than just doing the normal intro, I think what I'd love to hear

02:40.120 --> 02:47.040
and I think the audience would appreciate is what was your artistic journey like before

02:47.040 --> 02:53.840
NFTs and what is your artistic journey been like since you've joined the space and since

02:53.840 --> 02:55.840
NFTs.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.560
So Priyanka, hopefully you could hear all that and if you would like to kick things

02:59.560 --> 03:00.800
off, please do.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.040
And we have, by the way, the artists will be displayed as they're giving intros just

03:05.040 --> 03:09.040
to give the audience a sense for the kind of work that they do.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.240
Yeah, so, G.M.

03:11.240 --> 03:18.160
I would just like to thank, for spending the time at the University for inviting me.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.320
This is a huge honor.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.120
So a little bit about myself.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.920
I'm Priyanka Deil.

03:24.920 --> 03:33.760
I'm a photographer and the co-founder of Salutation Art Discollective called the Puerl.

03:33.760 --> 03:39.400
About my artistic journey, I first, as far as I can go back and remember, like, first

03:39.400 --> 03:43.320
on my pick up the camera, I was sometime around when I was 16.

03:43.320 --> 03:49.520
I had this Sony cyber shot that my aunt gifted me and I was just using that to take photos

03:49.520 --> 03:55.160
in and around my home and just try to perfect on positions.

03:55.160 --> 03:59.640
That's where I started, but when I went to college, I started shooting more portraits

03:59.640 --> 04:03.760
of friends and family.

04:03.760 --> 04:08.400
As a person, like I'm very shy and introverted and I did not like being photos.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.880
I was always the one monitoring to be the photographer whenever we had a gathering or

04:13.880 --> 04:14.880
anything.

04:14.880 --> 04:23.320
So that's how my interests grew more than just like going around your home and taking pictures.

04:23.320 --> 04:31.120
And then in 2010, my elder brother gifted me my first DSLR, which pretty much changed

04:31.120 --> 04:39.840
the course of how I pursued photography even though I was studying engineering in my undergrad

04:39.840 --> 04:43.360
and as a master's student.

04:43.360 --> 04:49.160
I went to grad school in LA and I took a far-time job as an assistant photographer there.

04:49.160 --> 04:55.560
I wanted to keep doing photography even though I was doing engineering.

04:55.560 --> 05:07.320
I wanted to explore more, like, only to shoot more than just landscapes of portraits.

05:07.320 --> 05:12.120
So that's why I took up a job at the University for the school's newspaper, which gave me

05:12.120 --> 05:16.840
an end to shoot events, which I ended up loving.

05:16.840 --> 05:22.920
So after my graduation, I moved back home to India and I started doing setting photography

05:22.920 --> 05:29.160
back home, which pretty much like they started my career, end of photography, because I had

05:29.160 --> 05:32.840
a lot of friends and family, like, connections back home.

05:32.840 --> 05:40.360
It was kind of sort of easier for me to, like, fine-tute there and fine people who really

05:40.360 --> 05:45.480
believed in me and loved my work and wanted to give me a chance when I just aren't a

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
dog.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.440
So that's where my journey started as a photographer, like professionally, back in 2013.

05:51.440 --> 05:57.040
Since then, I've tried a lot of different kinds of photography, but I realized that the

05:57.040 --> 06:03.160
one that I enjoyed the most was where I was not told what I need to photograph.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.680
So, like, basically, whatever I photographed when I was traveling, which was mainly landscapes

06:08.680 --> 06:13.000
and city-scapes.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.520
So that's what I tried to do more of starting in 2016.

06:18.520 --> 06:22.760
Like, I tried to travel as much as possible and do all that.

06:22.760 --> 06:27.600
Fast forward to 2020, already into the...

06:27.600 --> 06:36.920
So, fast forward to 2020, like, a month into the pandemic, I started posting a lot of my

06:36.920 --> 06:43.160
art on product, and I somehow found this community of photographers and artists who were also

06:43.160 --> 06:45.960
on Twitter, which I had no idea about.

06:45.960 --> 06:52.480
And they're the ones who actually introduced me to NFVs later on in October and November.

06:52.480 --> 06:57.160
And that's when I first heard about technology, and I went to my brother and was like, hey,

06:57.160 --> 07:00.080
like, there's this whole thing where people sell their art.

07:00.080 --> 07:08.920
Like, I heard about Bock and people for the first time back in November 2020, and my brother

07:08.920 --> 07:14.760
kind of explained me what all of it meant, like what NFVs are and what it means.

07:14.760 --> 07:22.280
But I did not enter a space, like, I make a ball of it, or I drop my first NFVs until

07:22.280 --> 07:30.040
10, 2021, which is when I dropped my genesis term, Ph.P.'s.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.480
Since then, I have...

07:32.480 --> 07:33.920
So that's almost two years now.

07:33.920 --> 07:41.160
So since then, I've had an amazing time meeting people all over the world.

07:41.160 --> 07:51.720
And last year, that's how last year, after meeting a lot of photographers and artists,

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
I decided to...

07:52.720 --> 07:58.480
We decided to actually form a collective for a validation artist in the space called the

07:58.480 --> 07:59.480
Baro.

07:59.480 --> 08:07.480
And it's almost exactly a year since we launched the collective, which is great.

08:07.480 --> 08:17.000
And I think before NFVs, a lot of my photography was client work, but since NFVs, I have had

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
the...

08:18.000 --> 08:27.160
I think I'm lucky that I had the chance to choose what I could photograph and just travel

08:27.160 --> 08:33.880
more and not click on client shoots that I didn't really want to do, but I did it anyway,

08:33.880 --> 08:39.760
just so that I can make enough money to be able to travel.

08:39.760 --> 08:43.800
So I at least have the following change that for me as an artist.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.800
I don't know if anyone too long, sorry.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.640
No, not at all.

08:49.640 --> 08:50.640
Thank you, Priyanka.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.800
That was a really good intro.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.520
And we'll dive into more of those topics as we go along.

08:56.520 --> 08:57.520
Drift.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.040
I was wondering if you could go next and again, give a brief intro and maybe talk a little

09:02.040 --> 09:04.360
bit about your life, Priy, and post-NFT.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.160
Yeah, absolutely.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.360
Can you hear me okay?

09:07.360 --> 09:10.360
Yeah, we can hear you, Greg.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.280
Awesome.

09:12.280 --> 09:21.520
So before NFVs, I've been photographing for almost five years now.

09:21.520 --> 09:30.200
I started in May of 2018, and at the time, I had been in the army for four years coming

09:30.200 --> 09:34.960
straight out of high school, and then I wouldn't be in the army for two more years after that.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.720
To kind of set the scene, I had never been in anything artistic.

09:38.720 --> 09:47.440
It was never really encouraged in my home growing up, and I enjoy in the army after high

09:47.440 --> 09:54.920
school to kind of get out of the conditions that I was in, continue to be self-sustainable,

09:54.920 --> 10:01.400
which I had been through some of my teenage years, and yeah, by the time that I picked

10:01.400 --> 10:05.840
up a camera in 2018, my life was changing completely.

10:05.840 --> 10:09.920
When I first joined the military, I thought I was going to make it a career.

10:09.920 --> 10:14.760
I thought that it would give me the opportunity to travel, to go to college, to see the world

10:14.760 --> 10:20.160
and also do something active, which I really enjoyed.

10:20.160 --> 10:30.240
I began to feel very displaced and very uncomfortable coming into 2018 about my place in the military.

10:30.240 --> 10:38.320
I became a lot more conscious about my identity as a black man in America, and then in turn,

10:38.320 --> 10:45.040
serving in the United States army, especially at the capacity, and on the level that I was,

10:45.040 --> 10:48.600
began to feel very uncomfortable to me because I did not feel like I was serving a country

10:48.600 --> 10:53.520
that was necessarily looking out for my best interest or the interest of people that would

10:53.520 --> 10:57.760
look like me.

10:57.760 --> 11:04.280
This was on top of me also going through some PTSD that year after losing a couple of my

11:04.280 --> 11:12.360
close soldiers to suicide, who I was working with.

11:12.360 --> 11:19.160
I did not know that my life was getting ready to change so much, but 2018 was a year where

11:19.160 --> 11:24.360
I was completely restructuring as a human being.

11:24.360 --> 11:32.080
I picked up this camera in 2018, and I remember I had been moved out of special operations

11:32.080 --> 11:37.360
to a light infantry unit at Fort Polk, Louisiana in the middle of nowhere, essentially.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.920
I started driving like three hours to Houston, Texas to just shoot with this thing because

11:42.920 --> 11:46.280
I had nothing else to do.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.600
In my personal life, things were kind of in the shambles.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.760
I was in a lot of debt.

11:49.760 --> 11:54.720
I had a lot of things to work myself out of just from how I grew up and things I didn't

11:54.720 --> 11:56.360
know.

11:56.360 --> 12:01.040
Just coming to that point of adulthood where you have to own your childhood and your mistakes,

12:01.040 --> 12:05.800
and you have to correct some of those things and unlearn some of those things that you

12:05.800 --> 12:12.040
learned that weren't good, and also grow consciously into your identity as a free adult now in

12:12.040 --> 12:15.040
the world.

12:15.040 --> 12:20.040
I went to a portrait meetup and stuff with other photographers.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.120
I didn't like it.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.360
I just said it just wasn't for me.

12:26.360 --> 12:30.680
One night I woke up in the middle of the night and I drove to Houston because I had this

12:30.680 --> 12:31.680
dream.

12:31.680 --> 12:36.240
I just told me to go to Houston, so I did it.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.800
I found this skyscraper that was under construction as well as 50 stories tall.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.240
I just remember hopping the fence and going in and taking the steps all the way up to

12:44.240 --> 12:51.400
the top and sitting up there above the city of Houston and just being completely at peace,

12:51.400 --> 12:55.160
like immersed in the moment.

12:55.160 --> 13:03.800
I took a few photos that were awful because I sucked back then, but I just found such

13:03.800 --> 13:10.160
a sense of peace and belonging, and especially at the time, because I was feeling so displaced

13:10.160 --> 13:16.800
because I was feeling so uncomfortable with a life path that I was essentially stuck in

13:16.800 --> 13:25.800
traction until 2022, I had not been retired in 2020.

13:25.800 --> 13:30.440
Finding a place of home and finding a place where I felt understood meant everything to

13:30.440 --> 13:33.800
me and I began to find that in my work.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.720
I would continue shooting.

13:37.720 --> 13:45.360
I had picked up a couple extra jobs to help pay off debt so then I could travel more.

13:45.360 --> 13:50.440
Basically everything in my life started becoming geared towards me pursuing this passion,

13:50.440 --> 13:54.000
and I had no idea really what it would end up being.

13:54.000 --> 13:59.480
I just knew that this was where I felt at home, and I could tell that it was making me a better

13:59.480 --> 14:06.680
human being, this pursuit of urban exploring, and every single time I was going out and

14:06.680 --> 14:11.000
fulfilling this purpose, I felt like a more loving human being.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.080
I felt like a more.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.040
I felt like a more well-rounded human being and began to infect all areas of my life,

14:19.040 --> 14:23.600
and I was doing everything better, including my job at that time in the Army.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.760
Well, I had been injured in the Army for a couple of years, but I had just been nursing

14:28.760 --> 14:31.800
it, injury and pushing through it.

14:31.800 --> 14:40.000
My right leg has some internal damage and is permanently swollen more than my left leg

14:40.000 --> 14:42.840
is.

14:42.840 --> 14:48.760
I had deployed in 2016, they don't know if anything happened on deployment, if it was

14:48.760 --> 14:54.600
a result of that, or if it was the result of what could be any number of other things

14:54.600 --> 14:58.440
was jumping out of airplanes or other forces that I did.

14:58.440 --> 15:08.200
But they decided in fall of 2019 that they were going to medically discharge me.

15:08.200 --> 15:19.240
And then in March of 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, at the end of March, I medically

15:19.240 --> 15:27.080
retired as a staff sergeant after about six years in the Army.

15:27.080 --> 15:36.240
And so at this point, I had wanted to pursue photography full-time, so I knew that, and

15:36.240 --> 15:39.080
I had been asking for that.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.880
And the universe has kind of opened up and gave me the opportunity.

15:42.880 --> 15:53.720
And so I got out and I just started traveling around the country in my little 2001 Volvo

15:53.720 --> 16:00.040
and shooting everywhere I possibly could, climbing and shooting underground and shooting bridges

16:00.040 --> 16:01.200
and skyscrapers.

16:01.200 --> 16:10.400
And I was selling prints online for a couple hundred dollars at the most back then and

16:10.400 --> 16:15.080
just trying to fund it however I could.

16:15.080 --> 16:26.480
I was involved on Twitter and Instagram with a photography community and I felt like, okay,

16:26.480 --> 16:30.720
maybe this could be something, but I have no idea how.

16:30.720 --> 16:35.720
Especially because it was not like an art form that was accepted by the world.

16:35.720 --> 16:40.520
But inside I always felt like this was meant for me and I just had to keep pursuing it

16:40.520 --> 16:45.000
even if I'm pursuing it in the dark.

16:45.000 --> 16:51.280
So, seven months later, I'd be back at my home city of Cincinnati for longer than a week

16:51.280 --> 16:55.080
for the first time in seven years.

16:55.080 --> 17:03.960
And I would go and climb Great American Tower, the tallest building in Cincinnati.

17:03.960 --> 17:09.920
I had recently shot the Red Stadium to and a few other Cincinnati skyscrapers.

17:09.920 --> 17:16.640
And that night while I was up on the crown of the building shooting, there would be a

17:16.640 --> 17:18.480
police response.

17:18.480 --> 17:24.120
They had seen me on a security camera on the top floor of the building and I didn't know

17:24.120 --> 17:27.960
they sent a response.

17:27.960 --> 17:35.800
I had got done shooting on the crown and went and left the building, heading down the stairs

17:35.800 --> 17:41.400
and unbeknownst to me, there was over 20 officers and like dogs in the building.

17:41.400 --> 17:47.160
And I heard people on different floors, but I just thought, oh, let me get out of the building.

17:47.160 --> 17:52.640
I didn't realize it was such an extensive response.

17:52.640 --> 18:00.480
So what happened after that was a local detective in the Central Business District identified

18:00.480 --> 18:06.480
me with the help of the FBI and Homeland Security, given my military background and special

18:06.480 --> 18:11.840
operations and some of the training I had gone through.

18:11.840 --> 18:18.000
And it's debated if my race played a big part in it, but we do think so.

18:18.000 --> 18:23.800
I was then a warrant was put out for my arrest, but it was put out for armed robbery.

18:23.800 --> 18:31.120
It wasn't put out for like trespassing, you know, and I was neither armed or robbed anything.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.680
But I did not know this.

18:33.680 --> 18:39.360
So I was across country shooting, heading to Las Vegas, Nevada to do what was a big deal

18:39.360 --> 18:43.640
at the time, like my first product shoot, which would pay me, you know, a couple thousand

18:43.640 --> 18:44.640
dollars.

18:44.640 --> 18:48.240
That was a ton of money at the time.

18:48.240 --> 18:57.360
And I was driving down I-40 West with my friend.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.360
She was driving.

18:58.360 --> 19:00.600
I was sitting in the passenger seat because I was not feeling well.

19:00.600 --> 19:03.160
We were outside Flagstaff, Arizona.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.640
The highway was stopped.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
Cars were backed up.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.640
We see a helicopter.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.920
We think someone's getting medvedact out.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.960
They're not.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.480
We start driving backwards down the highway arm with assault rifles.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.040
It just looks like something out of a movie, you know.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.480
I was running a fever and in and out of consciousness.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.560
So I was just sitting there sleeping in the car.

19:23.560 --> 19:28.480
Well I come to about 15 minutes later and the car is completely surrounded.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.880
Dogs, police officers, helicopters right overhead.

19:32.880 --> 19:39.400
And they call my name with a loudspeaker and they ordered me out of the car.

19:39.400 --> 19:45.880
They tell me if I move verbatim, if you move, we will kill you.

19:45.880 --> 19:49.760
Next thing I know I'm faced down on the concrete and then I'm being brought to my feet at

19:49.760 --> 19:52.400
see a paper, you know, presented to me.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.280
My face is on the paper.

19:54.280 --> 19:58.320
I'm completely disillusioned as to what's going on.

19:58.320 --> 20:04.440
Well I would be put in the cop car and told I was being charged with armed robbery that

20:04.440 --> 20:12.640
they were, that there was a nationwide worn out from my arrest and then sent to jail in

20:12.640 --> 20:13.640
Arizona.

20:13.640 --> 20:21.400
I wasn't accepted at the jail, sent to a hospital because I was sick, spent five days there,

20:21.400 --> 20:23.920
chained to the hospital bed, called my dad.

20:23.920 --> 20:25.840
My dad called a lawyer.

20:25.840 --> 20:31.040
I got my lawyer and sent in to step with me through the whole case.

20:31.040 --> 20:37.520
To shorten the rest of it, I would spend two months in Arizona with no bond, be brought

20:37.520 --> 20:45.080
back to Cincinnati, Ohio, greet it there and then have the detective go state to state

20:45.080 --> 20:52.300
to try to add on any charges possible with this narrative that I was, you know, a secret

20:52.300 --> 20:58.600
armed robber that could be an enemy of the United States and it became very personal.

20:58.600 --> 21:05.120
It eventually had to fight through five state cases after four months of being incarcerated,

21:05.120 --> 21:08.600
having my bond raised almost half a million dollars.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.360
I finally get out.

21:10.360 --> 21:20.560
I'd be re-arrested twice at gunpoint unarmed and would get into NFTs at the end of April

21:20.560 --> 21:27.920
2021 as a way to start paying legal bills and basically rebuild my life.

21:27.920 --> 21:35.720
I was at home with my dad in his apartment at that time sleeping on the floor because

21:35.720 --> 21:40.160
he had a very small apartment, but we were making do.

21:40.160 --> 21:45.120
You know, I'd got out and I went and got a laptop and just started sharing my work on

21:45.120 --> 21:51.760
Twitter and stuff again and found the NFT space and thought like this might be my ticket

21:51.760 --> 21:58.400
to being able to fight my way through this and not get completely swallowed by it.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.000
I started selling pieces on foundation come June or July.

22:02.000 --> 22:06.640
I got on super rare and started selling some pieces in August of 2021.

22:06.640 --> 22:13.600
I released where my vans go, sold out the first drop and then the second drop sold out in

22:13.600 --> 22:20.680
September, we started to have really awesome secondary sales and then I sold out the third

22:20.680 --> 22:25.480
drop in October of 2021.

22:25.480 --> 22:30.200
And then since then it's just been a really amazing journey.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.200
I was able to pay my lawyers.

22:33.200 --> 22:35.240
I was able to make it do my case.

22:35.240 --> 22:41.400
In fact, my everything officially ended for me about three weeks ago.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.800
So after two years, I have no convictions.

22:45.800 --> 22:54.720
I won all five of my cases and can now go back to creating my work and living my life without

22:54.720 --> 22:59.600
any fear or anything over my head.

22:59.600 --> 23:07.600
So, yeah, the story appeared in the New York Times on June 6, 2021 and that helped raise

23:07.600 --> 23:13.240
a lot of public awareness about the case because until the public eye was really involved,

23:13.240 --> 23:20.320
there was not a lot of help I could get to make sure that I had a fair legal chance at

23:20.320 --> 23:25.880
fighting and that changed a lot when people actually were paying attention to what was

23:25.880 --> 23:26.880
happening.

23:26.880 --> 23:34.120
So I am very fortunate and lucky to be the point one of the point one percent that ever

23:34.120 --> 23:40.520
get a fighting chance at getting their voice heard outside of those walls.

23:40.520 --> 23:46.760
And if it were not for that, I'm not sure that I would be talking right now.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.200
So yeah, that's a little bit about me.

23:49.200 --> 23:54.120
I put out first day out a year later after my release date.

23:54.120 --> 24:03.840
So this past April, April 9, 2022, I released an open edition and it was able to do it on

24:03.840 --> 24:14.160
my own smart contract, Der Manifold, and own site and give that 15 percent that would have

24:14.160 --> 24:22.760
gone to a platform back to the bail project in Cincinnati, Ohio, where it's been moving

24:22.760 --> 24:32.800
in a rotating fund and has freed 60 people and counting and helped them with post release,

24:32.800 --> 24:38.840
like get back on their feet and get to court and do what they have to do so that they're

24:38.840 --> 24:45.800
just not stuck in there because they were low income like I was.

24:45.800 --> 24:47.360
And it's been an amazing journey.

24:47.360 --> 24:52.800
So there's so much more I want to do with my work and whatnot, but that's a little bit

24:52.800 --> 24:55.800
about me, so it takes so much time.

24:55.800 --> 25:04.440
Now, I think suffice to say two things, one that is one of the more incredible stories

25:04.440 --> 25:06.560
Web3 or otherwise.

25:06.560 --> 25:10.760
And the second thing is congratulations on finally wrapping everything up.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.280
Really, truly, glad you finally threw it.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.240
Yeah, absolutely.

25:16.240 --> 25:20.440
We're going to dig in like Priyanka's intro as well.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.640
We're going to dig into some of those topics.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.640
Blessing.

25:23.640 --> 25:27.640
I was wondering if you could give us an intro as well.

25:27.640 --> 25:28.640
Okay.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.280
Hi, everyone.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.000
I'm so happy to be here.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.200
Good for you, Pochin.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.720
My name is Blessing Atas.

25:37.720 --> 25:43.480
I am a phone photographer based in Abuja, Nigeria.

25:43.480 --> 25:46.480
So it's a bit about my background.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.520
Back in high school, I used to paint.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.400
I think I was really good at it.

25:50.400 --> 25:58.120
I mean, I think I discovered I loved painting the first time I started drawing in primary

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
school.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.120
So I took a point in high school and I continued painting.

26:03.120 --> 26:06.720
But at some points, I stopped.

26:06.720 --> 26:11.360
And it was something that I'd just always been back in my head or something like that.

26:11.360 --> 26:13.800
In the future, I ended up creating art.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.600
I couldn't get back to it.

26:17.600 --> 26:23.720
So my plan for the future was to probably go study arts in union one day, or that did

26:23.720 --> 26:24.720
not happen.

26:24.720 --> 26:30.760
So along the line, I found photography through a friend of mine.

26:30.760 --> 26:36.840
So at some point, I started hanging out with friends that were into photography.

26:36.840 --> 26:42.600
And I saw the friend of mine that I was interested in taking pictures if you could teach me.

26:42.600 --> 26:48.200
So I started following the photography events.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.200
When he has shoot, he'll take me.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.600
If there are events for photography, he'll take me up as well.

26:53.600 --> 26:58.360
Also very nervous for you.

26:58.360 --> 27:03.720
So one of those days when I was with him at this event, there was this photographer

27:03.720 --> 27:09.080
that was hosting photography events here in Abuja.

27:09.080 --> 27:13.120
And while we were there, the host of the event kept pulling me off and asking me questions

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
about photography.

27:14.120 --> 27:19.080
And at that time, I had no idea or thought about photography.

27:19.080 --> 27:24.080
I just knew that was something that was interesting, but I had no clue what anything about photography

27:24.080 --> 27:25.080
is.

27:25.080 --> 27:26.600
But he kept asking questions.

27:26.600 --> 27:31.400
And there was one point he asked me if I had an interest in photography.

27:31.400 --> 27:37.720
And I said, yes, maybe sometime, I'd like to start.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.160
And he was like, OK.

27:39.160 --> 27:44.640
And then in the middle of that, he just asked people in the crowd if someone was interested

27:44.640 --> 27:46.640
wanting to teach me photography.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.480
And someone raised their hand up.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.960
So I was supposed to learn through that person, person was supposed to be my teacher or something.

27:53.960 --> 28:01.000
But unfortunately for me, he got a job to be like a personal photographer or someone.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.280
So he had to move.

28:02.280 --> 28:05.440
So I was left to like back to square one.

28:05.440 --> 28:08.320
So I went back to this person, the host of the event.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.920
And I told him about, I don't have a money to buy a camera.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.240
I don't know how to start.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.640
And I don't know what to do.

28:13.640 --> 28:17.040
The person I was meant to teach me had moved to somewhere else.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.320
And so he told me to start with what I have, which is my phone.

28:20.320 --> 28:24.000
And at that time, I was using the Samsung S7 Edge.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.320
So I just started taking pictures with my phone.

28:27.320 --> 28:31.080
Still didn't know what kind of photography I wanted to do yet.

28:31.080 --> 28:38.600
So there was a time where they had this photo walk event.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.240
And I was invited as well.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.320
So I followed all the photographers.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.720
I was the only phone photographer.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.840
So I used my friends iPhone 7 Plus.

28:48.840 --> 28:54.360
Why others were taking pictures with their phones, with their camera, sorry.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.280
And when we were doing, so I was speaking about different genres of photography, wedding,

28:58.280 --> 28:59.720
events and all of those things.

28:59.720 --> 29:04.960
And in that moment, I just said, I think I know what I would like to do with my work.

29:04.960 --> 29:13.480
So I think from childhood, I love movies, I love history, culture and all of those things.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.000
So it's what I try to incorporate in my work as the time goes.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.040
So I just started taking pictures.

29:21.040 --> 29:27.000
And I think be it 20, 19, 2020.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.960
I was invited to a photography conference here in Nigeria, going to Lagos.

29:33.960 --> 29:37.400
So I had to travel to Lagos for the conference.

29:37.400 --> 29:46.160
And in the conference, there were amazing photographers from around the world that came.

29:46.160 --> 29:50.840
And there was this lady that really inspired me, I think, to just actually start.

29:50.840 --> 29:53.960
So I can't remember her name is Bella Kaptok.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.400
So she's really great with what she does.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.360
And I think from how I learned that you can do so much with So Little.

30:01.360 --> 30:09.720
So because while she was trying to tell us about how to just explain how she was able

30:09.720 --> 30:10.720
to create with So Little.

30:10.720 --> 30:11.960
And so I picked that.

30:11.960 --> 30:15.440
And when I go back home, I would write my friend over to my house or dress up.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.760
And I just started taking random pictures.

30:17.760 --> 30:21.520
Along the line, I started showing the host of events.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.200
And the person that was going to teach me, like, oh, look what I've done today.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.280
What do you think?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.800
And so they said, like, just helping me out.

30:27.800 --> 30:30.680
We're like, where to go on edgy and what to do, blah, blah, blah.

30:30.680 --> 30:33.120
So I started going on YouTube as well.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.640
And just starting to have to edit photos.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.360
I just understand myself more.

30:37.360 --> 30:41.360
So yeah, this was just immediate for me to start telling my story.

30:41.360 --> 30:46.160
So in 2020, I took up on it myself to take more pictures.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.320
And in that moment, my phone got stolen.

30:49.320 --> 30:53.680
So I didn't have a phone at that period of time.

30:53.680 --> 30:58.600
But I think the basic thing about my story is just having people around me that believed

30:58.600 --> 30:59.600
in my work.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.200
And I believe that I can do something with photography.

31:03.200 --> 31:05.000
So I had all these ideas.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.160
And I would reach out to my friend.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.360
And I was like, oh, I have this idea.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.360
But I don't know what to do.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
I don't have a phone.

31:09.360 --> 31:10.360
I don't have a camera.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.360
I don't know what to do.

31:11.360 --> 31:12.840
And so she'd be like, oh, I'm with her for you.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.320
You can use my phone.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.000
And we'll just do this thing.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.280
So I'll tell my friends.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.160
And everyone will just get ready.

31:19.160 --> 31:22.000
My friends will come with their cars.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.960
And give me their phone.

31:23.960 --> 31:24.960
They'll also work for me.

31:24.960 --> 31:30.000
So that was how I was able to create work in 2020.

31:30.000 --> 31:36.240
And also, I think around 2020 as well, a friend of mine gave me his iPhone 7 Plus because

31:36.240 --> 31:37.800
he had gotten a new phone.

31:37.800 --> 31:39.640
And so I joined Clubhouse.

31:39.640 --> 31:45.360
And while I joined Clubhouse, I started going into photography rooms just to learn more.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.360
Because I was still very new to the whole thing.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.600
So I was in the room one time.

31:52.600 --> 31:56.040
And then people found out my work.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.600
And I think in the last time, there was a time when Miss An came into the room.

32:00.600 --> 32:03.240
And some of my workers were, he loved my work.

32:03.240 --> 32:09.600
And he then reached out to people in Apple and then showed them my work, talked to them

32:09.600 --> 32:10.600
about my work.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.120
And they were really impressed.

32:12.120 --> 32:18.920
And they sent me the iPhone 12 Pro just to appreciate the work that I do.

32:18.920 --> 32:23.760
And yeah, so over time, it's just been an amazing opportunity for me.

32:23.760 --> 32:30.000
Because I never imagined that I would go far with just telling stories in my work.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.080
And I think around 2021, I started hearing about NFTs.

32:35.080 --> 32:39.480
But I wasn't really interested in it because I didn't see photography there.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.920
It was more digital ads and all of those things that wasn't really in my field.

32:43.920 --> 32:49.360
But I think along the line, I'm afraid of mine who was already into NFTs.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.280
I started speaking to him about it.

32:51.280 --> 32:53.800
And he unbounded me into NFTs.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.920
And well, so far so good.

32:55.920 --> 33:00.760
I'm still, I don't know what the word is.

33:00.760 --> 33:05.000
I come still finding my way in the NFT world, but so far so good.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.280
So I think that's a bit of my story.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.000
I didn't go into it.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000
I'm just in details.

33:10.000 --> 33:14.520
But yeah, that's kind of my story.

33:14.520 --> 33:17.080
Blessing just as a quick question.

33:17.080 --> 33:22.280
Are you still an iPhone photographer?

33:22.280 --> 33:24.640
Yeah, I'm still an iPhone photographer.

33:24.640 --> 33:28.640
But hopefully, I'm hoping to buy my camera at the CF-10.

33:28.640 --> 33:34.120
Save up because I want to get the Fujifilm X-84.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.120
So I dream of camera.

33:35.120 --> 33:38.360
So hopefully this year I get that out.

33:38.360 --> 33:40.680
But yeah, I'm still using my fluency creatures.

33:40.680 --> 33:44.840
And I'm going to work on something, come in Sunday.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.520
I might work on something in my field as well.

33:47.520 --> 33:49.400
So yeah.

33:49.400 --> 33:50.400
Yeah, great.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.360
Amazing.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.240
Great.

33:52.240 --> 33:56.360
OK, let's move on to our first topic.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.200
And in order to set the stage here,

33:59.200 --> 34:02.560
I'd like to throw out some statistics on photography

34:02.560 --> 34:07.520
that I think will be interesting for the audience to hear.

34:07.520 --> 34:08.960
So I was doing some research.

34:08.960 --> 34:15.880
And I was looking at the top contemporary artists

34:15.880 --> 34:19.000
in the world ranked by various publications out there.

34:19.000 --> 34:20.120
I won't go through them all.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.560
And some of them I've never even heard of.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.560
But on most of these, on almost all of these,

34:26.560 --> 34:32.120
generally you have in a top 30, top 50, top 100 list,

34:32.120 --> 34:36.880
one maybe two photographers on that list.

34:36.880 --> 34:40.320
Typically Cindy Sherman and maybe

34:40.320 --> 34:43.080
Man Ray on some of these.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.920
So photographers as contemporary artists

34:46.920 --> 34:52.760
are already, it seems, not the most popular people,

34:52.760 --> 34:56.320
amongst people who put together lists of contemporary artists.

34:56.320 --> 34:58.280
So that's sort of fact number one.

34:58.280 --> 35:02.600
Fact number two is that the most expensive,

35:02.600 --> 35:04.240
this is according to Wikipedia, by the way,

35:04.240 --> 35:08.000
so maybe give me a break if it's not exactly right.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.600
But according to Wikipedia, the most expensive photograph

35:11.600 --> 35:14.800
ever sold was $12.5 million.

35:14.800 --> 35:18.520
It was Man Ray's Levi-Linde Ingress.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.520
For you native French speakers out there, please don't hold my,

35:21.520 --> 35:24.120
oh, God awful French against me.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.760
Number two was for $11 million.

35:27.760 --> 35:31.120
And then number three was $4 million.

35:31.120 --> 35:34.080
So just to give you an idea, that's all time.

35:34.080 --> 35:37.880
Just to give you an idea, the 100th most expensive painting

35:37.880 --> 35:41.880
ever sold, number one is Salvador Mundi,

35:41.880 --> 35:46.560
around 450 million, the 100th is $70 million.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.680
So the most expensive photograph ever sold

35:49.680 --> 35:53.520
would not even make, I don't know, a top 1000 list

35:53.520 --> 35:58.320
of most expensive contemporary art pieces in history.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.040
So that's sort of fact number two.

36:00.040 --> 36:05.480
And in fact, if you add up all 30 of the most expensive photographs

36:05.480 --> 36:10.480
ever sold, it turns out that they would equal, roughly equal,

36:10.480 --> 36:12.680
a single painting that was sold in November.

36:12.680 --> 36:17.640
It was Cezanne's, Cezanne's sold in Paul Alle's auction.

36:17.640 --> 36:22.680
I'll spare you my attempt to speak French and tell you the name of it.

36:22.680 --> 36:28.880
But so photography generally does not sell well at auction

36:28.880 --> 36:32.720
or amongst the Tradart community.

36:32.720 --> 36:34.160
So that's sort of fact number two.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.320
Fact number three is, and I want to get into this with this panel here,

36:38.320 --> 36:42.760
but fact number three is that I believe part of the reason

36:42.760 --> 36:46.600
why this happens is that is the following.

36:46.600 --> 36:52.320
80% to 90% of planet Earth, depending on the source you use,

36:52.320 --> 36:54.160
owns a smartphone.

36:54.160 --> 36:58.080
And I think what's happened, and I think what's happening,

36:58.080 --> 37:01.640
is that a lot of folks say, well, I could do that.

37:01.640 --> 37:07.560
I have a camera on my phone, and yeah, it won't look as good as a Priyanka.

37:07.560 --> 37:10.480
But I could get pretty close, and I could get 80% of the way there.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.120
And I can recreate that.

37:13.120 --> 37:15.520
And I hear that a lot, actually.

37:15.520 --> 37:20.040
And the obvious response and the correct response is, well, no, you can't.

37:20.040 --> 37:23.280
But what I want to get into is why?

37:23.280 --> 37:24.960
And I want to talk to this panel.

37:24.960 --> 37:30.240
And maybe the place to start is with you blessing.

37:30.240 --> 37:35.320
But why do you think, A, that the photography community has not

37:35.320 --> 37:40.360
emerged in the same way as the sort of painting, sculpture,

37:40.360 --> 37:43.520
even the digital art space, and web three?

37:43.520 --> 37:50.160
And number two, what is the response to, well, I can do that,

37:50.160 --> 37:52.080
because I can do it on my smartphone.

37:52.080 --> 37:56.080
And maybe the partial answer to that is talking a little bit about your process.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.960
But I'll leave it up to the three of you to address this.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.440
So blessing, if you wouldn't mind kicking us off, I think that would be great.

38:02.440 --> 38:05.440
And Drifte and Priyanka, just please add in as you feel fit.

38:11.560 --> 38:15.720
I think this is the conversation we, like I've had this conversation

38:15.720 --> 38:20.080
with a lot of people even in the NFT space.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.080
I think a lot of people don't see photography as arts,

38:24.080 --> 38:31.200
because even when I speak to my friend that is not even in the NFT space,

38:31.200 --> 38:33.120
just having a normal conversation.

38:33.120 --> 38:36.320
When you talk about your photography as arts,

38:36.320 --> 38:40.280
mostly just when the first thing that comes in mind when they think about arts

38:40.280 --> 38:46.720
is taking and painting on your canvas, that's what they see as art.

38:46.720 --> 38:50.040
And people really see photography as art.

38:50.040 --> 38:54.600
I feel like as, you know, as the, how do I say this?

38:54.600 --> 38:58.160
As we progress, as people, you know,

38:58.160 --> 39:02.080
and the years is growing and the same is growing, like things are changing.

39:02.080 --> 39:12.320
And technology is making things much more easy in a way that we can tell our stories.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.560
We don't have to, it doesn't have to be through just wanting media,

39:15.560 --> 39:21.720
because, how about I say this, sorry, you know, arts is seen in every form anyway.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.040
So art can be told, even in cooking there's art,

39:24.040 --> 39:26.200
I feel like there's art in everything we do.

39:26.200 --> 39:31.120
But for people to, I think it's more for people to see arts in photography,

39:31.120 --> 39:36.360
because as an artist, for me, I'm also going to understand

39:36.360 --> 39:37.560
that there are different forms of art.

39:37.560 --> 39:41.360
There's visual arts, there's storytelling, there's conceptual, there's events,

39:41.360 --> 39:46.800
there's wedding, there's so many types of photography.

39:46.800 --> 39:50.160
And when you come to visual arts storytelling,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.440
and everyone just nature on all of those things,

39:53.440 --> 40:00.720
it takes time for a person to put together something to, to create work.

40:00.720 --> 40:03.680
So I can just think, oh, I can just go out and, you know,

40:03.680 --> 40:06.240
clean my camera and it will give me what I want.

40:06.240 --> 40:10.560
But for me, as a visual artist or as a storyteller,

40:10.560 --> 40:12.960
I plan most of my shoots.

40:12.960 --> 40:18.480
I, you know, I sometimes I write them down, I write my ideas down,

40:18.480 --> 40:20.320
and then I build upon them.

40:20.320 --> 40:23.920
And in order for me to tell the story, the way that I want to tell them,

40:23.920 --> 40:28.880
I have to think of the art field to correspond with the story,

40:28.880 --> 40:33.440
the location, the props, everything has to match to tell that story.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.440
And sometimes it takes years, it takes days, it takes months to put together,

40:37.440 --> 40:42.240
in order for me to tell my story, because I want it to be told perfectly.

40:42.240 --> 40:45.040
But sometimes, I mean, it's not everything that's perfect,

40:45.040 --> 40:50.080
but like, in order for you to tell your story, but for me, I put things in order,

40:50.080 --> 40:53.040
you know, even like for my shoot, I'm planning for it.

40:53.040 --> 40:57.200
And, you know, having the outfits together,

40:57.200 --> 41:00.720
the right models that I want, that I feel like I'm going to tell the story

41:00.720 --> 41:03.920
that I want to tell properly, the models, the location.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.240
So I'm traveling all the way from where I'm to another place,

41:06.240 --> 41:07.600
just to tell the story.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.040
So I feel like if people start to see photography as art,

41:11.040 --> 41:14.800
not just you taking your phone or your camera to just click,

41:14.800 --> 41:19.760
maybe it will be, it will be singing at different lights, I don't know.

41:19.760 --> 41:23.920
But I don't know how long that's going to take,

41:23.920 --> 41:29.840
because I've had arguments in the space where,

41:29.840 --> 41:32.240
you know, I've had like a fellow photographer,

41:32.240 --> 41:36.720
see photographers just taking a picture, like you just going,

41:36.720 --> 41:38.960
you just like going out to take a picture.

41:38.960 --> 41:44.720
And I think that's very wrong because even if you've learned,

41:44.720 --> 41:49.360
you know, how to understand in light,

41:49.360 --> 41:53.920
understanding how you work, or the kind of photography you want for yourself,

41:53.920 --> 41:55.920
or the stories you want yourself, or yourself.

41:55.920 --> 41:58.400
In as much as you've learned that you understand your camera,

41:58.400 --> 42:01.360
you understand your light, you understand everything as a photographer.

42:01.360 --> 42:05.760
Before you tell your story, you still put on that.

42:05.760 --> 42:11.840
And I think just as, you know, it takes a paint or a brush to a canvas,

42:11.840 --> 42:15.440
it's the same thing we take our cameras to the field when we're taking

42:15.440 --> 42:22.400
telling our stories, because before you're painting on a canvas,

42:22.400 --> 42:28.320
you think of the story, you have an idea before you start painting,

42:28.320 --> 42:30.800
and that's the same thing we do as photographers.

42:30.800 --> 42:37.280
So I think if people can see photography more in the art form,

42:37.280 --> 42:40.720
then just, you know, taking pictures, and I think maybe it just starts to change,

42:40.720 --> 42:43.120
or until then, I don't know.

42:44.720 --> 42:46.160
I don't know if I may be upset.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.560
No, that's a great response of Priyanka or Jana,

42:52.560 --> 42:54.560
that you have something to add.

42:54.560 --> 43:04.000
Well, I would say that a big part of the problem that we see in the world is,

43:05.120 --> 43:11.600
there's so much, there is so much exposure to photography, you know,

43:12.560 --> 43:16.240
and to where I do think that there's a desensitization to

43:17.840 --> 43:21.600
to photography and to what goes into it, because it is so

43:21.600 --> 43:28.480
digitally consumable, I think that we see, you know, everywhere you go,

43:28.480 --> 43:34.400
you're seeing photos, whether it's the background on your TV, or as soon as you open up nearly

43:34.400 --> 43:43.360
anything on your phone, and much like everything else in life, the process gets lost on the viewer

43:43.360 --> 43:51.040
to where the viewer can fall in love with the final product, but they don't have to appreciate

43:51.840 --> 43:58.000
the process to get that thing, and that's with most nearly any bit of art, but especially

43:58.000 --> 44:08.000
photography. And as far as changing it goes, I don't know if there's a right answer to that,

44:08.000 --> 44:17.680
because as cameras develop, as things change, it's going to become more and more that way I feel

44:17.680 --> 44:23.760
to where people are like, I can do that because my iPhone can now take sharper images or, you know,

44:23.760 --> 44:33.040
what have you, but I think that like, the last thing was saying, if people were to see the process

44:33.040 --> 44:40.880
behind, what it takes to just get one great image that would completely change their mind on the

44:40.880 --> 44:51.920
value of photography, you know, I mean, I think, at least speaking to my own work, like it can,

44:51.920 --> 44:57.440
some of the images like foreshadowing, foreshadowing had been in my mind for three years before I

44:57.440 --> 45:06.640
finally was able to create that image, you know, where my Vansgo collection took four years to

45:07.280 --> 45:14.720
put together hours of studying architecture and finding creative ways into spaces that

45:15.360 --> 45:22.960
otherwise would be impossible to get to, you know, taking risk after risk after risk in multiple

45:22.960 --> 45:33.600
different ways just to get one image, you know, and it's, yeah, people, people just don't see the

45:33.600 --> 45:41.280
process in that. I think that, I think that that leaves us as the artist kind of in a state where

45:41.840 --> 45:48.560
sometimes we have to bring the process to them, which is, but that doesn't, you know, not everyone

45:48.560 --> 45:53.600
can do that with their art too. If you're a street photographer, you can't walk around with

45:55.200 --> 46:04.400
another camera on a tripod filming you while you wait three hours for someone to walk,

46:04.400 --> 46:08.720
you know, an intersection at the right time with the right weather that you chose to go out in

46:09.280 --> 46:14.880
and just to get this one shot. It's hard to bring people to the process of photography sometimes

46:14.880 --> 46:26.320
and for me and my work, that's why I choose to wear my GoPro, take as much film, like, as much film

46:26.320 --> 46:32.960
on that and my phone and stuff and my camera is causal because I want to bring people closer to

46:32.960 --> 46:39.040
the experience, but if you're someone like Monores or who's a street photographer or like some other

46:39.040 --> 46:45.520
photographers in the space or even like with what Blessing is doing, it's not as easy if you can't

46:45.520 --> 46:52.240
show people everything, you know, whereas if you were to sit down and make a painting or something,

46:52.880 --> 46:59.280
you know, you can film the entire process or whatnot, it's not as simple with photography.

46:59.280 --> 47:10.640
But I do think that in time, I actually am optimistic that we will see not a lot but maybe a few

47:10.640 --> 47:18.160
photographers break this mold in the traditional art world where it will no longer be, you know,

47:18.160 --> 47:22.960
so many older photos that have sold for so much, I think we'll see new photographers do it too

47:22.960 --> 47:33.920
and I think they'll do it by just setting the bar higher with what, how well they can capture,

47:33.920 --> 47:41.200
you know, an image that nobody else can capture and I think that that should be our focus as

47:41.200 --> 47:48.480
photographers in general is just like whatever our genre is, we want to just make it to, you know,

47:48.480 --> 47:55.120
a point of near-unbelievability at how good we've become, you know, or how much we've progressed and,

47:55.120 --> 48:01.760
you know, there's pressure in that but I think that that pressure makes us better and you can't

48:01.760 --> 48:08.480
really put a price tag on it but just the ambition to want to do it, to want to show the world

48:08.480 --> 48:15.760
excellence in that way, I think that it will manifest in price in a traditional art world

48:15.760 --> 48:26.080
eventually too, I do think that in time we will see that happen and that as time goes on we'll see

48:26.080 --> 48:33.360
a few photographers cut through that mold or just so excellent at what they do, the bulk majority

48:33.360 --> 48:42.720
won't, 99.9% won't but that's also, you know, like nearly any other genre, you know, so I don't

48:42.720 --> 48:49.600
think it's impossible but I do think that in order to do so there's going to have to be a drawing

48:49.600 --> 49:00.080
the audience in and drawing the world into process and showing them why it's so valuable which is

49:00.080 --> 49:05.920
something that sometimes like egotistically we don't want to do, we want to put out an image and be

49:05.920 --> 49:11.520
like respect my work just because it's, I think it's this good, you know, but sometimes people need

49:11.520 --> 49:20.960
they need to be brought to, you know, what made this image what it is and so I do think that we

49:20.960 --> 49:27.040
can put in that extra work as photographers and I'm optimistic, I don't know if we're ever going

49:27.040 --> 49:33.840
to be appreciated the same way that other traditional art is but I think the goal is just to make

49:33.840 --> 49:40.880
something so excellent that it defines all past barriers and boundaries and at least I can't speak

49:40.880 --> 49:46.560
for others but like I am on the pursuit of that towards like if I take an image, doesn't matter

49:46.560 --> 49:52.960
if it's one a year, you know, I want it to be on the level where it's like that is top tier

49:52.960 --> 49:58.720
artistry in every single way, you know, from the timing to the conditions to everything it took to

49:58.720 --> 50:05.840
get that like the work, the effort, and I think we should be aiming to set the bar that high

50:05.840 --> 50:10.560
and I think because of the overconsumption of photography it's not only affected the consumer

50:10.560 --> 50:16.800
but it's affected us as artists too where we see so much of the art format where like oh this is good

50:17.680 --> 50:24.880
or this is great but it's like is it exceptional, you know, and some artists and photographers you

50:24.880 --> 50:30.720
see their work and you're like that is exceptional and sometimes as a photographer it like takes

50:30.720 --> 50:35.680
one to no one but generally anyone can see it towards like they are, you know, they're taking

50:35.680 --> 50:41.200
their time with it, they're, you know, they're figuring out they're constantly at work, you know,

50:41.200 --> 50:47.600
bettering their craft and I don't know I think that we can't fall into the trap of like consuming

50:47.600 --> 50:56.080
so much that we we too think that there's barriers we can't break past I think we can and I think we

50:56.080 --> 51:00.800
will if we're determined to do so so that's kind of my thoughts on it.

51:00.800 --> 51:07.200
Oh, let me add a few things here I mean my you know I'll give you my view that no one asked for

51:07.200 --> 51:12.800
but my view is that there's a very interesting parallel between photography and web 3 here

51:12.800 --> 51:19.200
which you touched on which is proof of work and I think the difference for me between photography

51:19.200 --> 51:25.920
and more what's called traditional art and digital non-photography digital art is that you have a

51:25.920 --> 51:32.000
better appreciation in traditional art and non-photography digital art for the work that went into it

51:32.000 --> 51:38.080
I don't think you can fully appreciate it I think there is some works that are just extraordinary

51:38.080 --> 51:42.320
and you're just never going to fully understand how much time and effort went into it but I do

51:42.320 --> 51:47.600
think that by and large with photography it is extraordinarily difficult for the collector to

51:47.600 --> 51:53.200
understand just how much blood, sweat and tears went into it you know I mean I see you know Tyleke

51:53.200 --> 52:00.000
and Kath Samarda, Patagonia and Sleeping Intents and you know there's videos of their tents blowing

52:00.000 --> 52:07.360
in the breeze and you know it's sub-zero temperatures and it's like well you know there's it was literally

52:07.360 --> 52:13.360
you know torture to go through and capture that perfect shot and I think drift what you're saying

52:13.360 --> 52:17.200
makes a lot of sense where there's a proof of work aspect of photography that needs to

52:17.200 --> 52:23.680
come out and I see a lot more artists doing this where they're posting on Twitter about their work

52:23.680 --> 52:28.480
and I think I have to personally encourage people to do more of that where you know it's it's the art

52:28.480 --> 52:35.760
the art is the process and the and the foot you know the final photo is the culmination of that process

52:35.760 --> 52:43.360
but the process itself is art as well which is is is really something fun to read about and understand

52:43.360 --> 52:51.280
Priyanka I was wondering if you might just take a moment and talk briefly you know just expand

52:51.280 --> 52:57.120
on what Drift said and maybe talk about kind of what your process is like and how much time and

52:57.120 --> 53:02.160
effort and pain or you know fun or whatever you want to say you know just however we have to describe

53:02.160 --> 53:12.960
it goes into taking the shot that you feel is worthy of of minting. Sure yeah so I want to go back

53:12.960 --> 53:18.960
a little bit to like for when I realized for the first time because even I was one of those people

53:20.080 --> 53:27.760
who who thought that like I was only taking like pictures of like good locations and that was it

53:27.760 --> 53:35.680
and I was editing them however I liked them and I I was subconsciously developing a photography style

53:35.680 --> 53:44.880
but I never realized that on 2020 when a couple of my photographs were selected for a for a

53:44.880 --> 53:51.760
French shop and Stockholm and they asked me to write about the photos and I was I was like I had no

53:51.760 --> 53:49.600
idea what to do and I was talking to a friend to get some help and she told me that

53:57.440 --> 54:02.720
you were a really emotional person and I like she knows me in and out so she told me that

54:02.720 --> 54:10.560
I know that you associate your memories of the places that you've been to or the songs you've

54:10.560 --> 54:18.960
listened to to the experiences you have had in that duration of your life so use that and see if

54:18.960 --> 54:25.760
you can find something that you can write about when you took the pictures so I think that was

54:25.760 --> 54:32.320
like my first aha builder that okay these are not just pictures they're pictures of a for dying one

54:34.560 --> 54:41.040
this was what I was experiencing in my life or like reminding of someone who helped me get

54:41.040 --> 54:47.040
two things so um 2020 was the first time when I saw myself as not just a photographer but like

54:47.040 --> 54:55.440
an artist and like my photography not just like any other pictures but art I mean even after 2020

54:55.440 --> 55:00.960
it took me a long time so even as a photographer if I'm feeling that way it's it's obvious that

55:00.960 --> 55:08.640
like the masses are also like a little bit uh um I'm also in that room where they think that okay

55:08.640 --> 55:18.320
photography is not art only um and I remember like early in NFTs when a lot of photographers joined in

55:18.320 --> 55:25.440
2020-21 a lot of us saw that we may not belong here there's always hours digital art that was

55:25.440 --> 55:31.680
non-pidermpathy like 2D and 3D and we were all trying to figure out like should we animate our

55:31.680 --> 55:36.800
photos and when someone said us to use until they get the by the way like my genesis was like a

55:36.800 --> 55:45.040
very tall like fun animation of my photo um but um we were all trying to figure that out because

55:45.040 --> 55:52.240
we felt uh as a group of photographers we felt that we didn't fit in um but then slowly like

55:52.240 --> 56:01.120
there's more without the first join and we found us placed uh in in in the NFT space um but um

56:01.840 --> 56:12.080
yeah I think um for a lot of uh for a lot of us uh it's um it's about like photography for a

56:12.080 --> 56:18.560
lot of us it's like at least for me it's about like understanding the moment or um realizing

56:18.560 --> 56:23.920
like and like identifying the elements that make up that moment that you are trying to capture

56:23.920 --> 56:33.040
or remember forever um and um for for me my personal uh personal um offensive style was

56:34.080 --> 56:41.280
uh I was mainly doing photography when I traveled uh just to like calm myself down and like

56:41.280 --> 56:49.280
um I saw myself from my surroundings so I was constantly seeking um calm in the key also on

56:49.280 --> 56:55.760
me that was that was something that I uh realized a couple of years after I started traveling for

56:55.760 --> 57:05.760
photography um so that's why I try to uh also convey when I uh when I um like try to decide which

57:05.760 --> 57:14.160
pictures are like have like have left uh lasting impact on me myself uh and they're worthy to

57:14.160 --> 57:22.560
blend um uh for example like my genesis uh collection was uh forgotten memories it was a tribute

57:23.360 --> 57:30.720
to a music producer called Adeji um I started shooting uh for that collection and intentionally

57:30.720 --> 57:36.720
I had no idea I was doing that but I started shooting in 2013 and up to 2018 with all the

57:36.720 --> 57:46.320
pictures in that collection are in uh in a span of five years but um this music helped me a lot

57:46.320 --> 57:51.200
to get through like a lot of bad times in my life so I wanted to share that experience of

57:51.200 --> 57:58.000
what I went through through my photography and through the music that I associated with it so I

57:58.000 --> 58:05.760
think um these kind of experiences and uh sharing them with the world is what makes

58:07.920 --> 58:15.280
what I shoot more unique than just like any other picture or like uh like anyone else would take

58:15.280 --> 58:21.920
pictures of I hope that would be fun um I'm really sorry I forgot the other question

58:21.920 --> 58:27.760
well no that's so I think I want to I want to actually expand on what you just said briefly

58:27.760 --> 58:31.760
because I think what's interesting to me about photography is exactly what you just said which

58:31.760 --> 58:39.600
is you wanted to take a moment or an emotion or a feeling and express it in a photograph but the

58:39.600 --> 58:46.160
interesting thing to me is that is art but had you picked up a paintbrush and done the exact same

58:46.160 --> 58:50.800
thing and been good at it let's assume you're you know both an excellent photographer what you

58:50.800 --> 58:57.600
are and an excellent painter the painting would have on average than a more valuable

58:58.320 --> 59:05.280
collectible desirable item to the collector community than the photograph but but they're both art

59:05.920 --> 59:13.040
um and it's just interesting to me to to explore that as a collector because you know again

59:13.040 --> 59:18.720
photography just does not seem to have made the exact the same and gain the same amount of respect

59:18.720 --> 59:24.720
as someone who can pick up a paintbrush and do and express the exact same emotion and moment and

59:24.720 --> 59:30.720
and and so forth so I think that's a very interesting comment that you made about about photography

59:30.720 --> 59:38.240
let me let me see I mean I feel like we've done a good job of setting the base for photography as an

59:38.240 --> 59:46.720
art format what I want to do now if it's okay with you guys is I want to tie it to web 3 and bring it

59:46.720 --> 59:54.000
forward and start thinking about photography as as as a future as the future of photography I should

59:54.000 --> 01:00:03.280
say what is it um what changed with NFTs and web 3 in your mind and I want to take the money out of

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:07.760
this situation because you know we can go through bear markets we can go through bull markets we

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:12.160
just went through a massive bull market now I asked some bear market and I know you know the

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.240
photography community is happy because we are buying photographs and and and and FTS of but I

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.720
think something more fundamental changed here rather than just a big FOMO pump by a lot of people who

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.240
were you know trying to you know trade for photographs online and one of the things I think that

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:37.600
changed is is provenance I think that photography has suffers more than digital art potentially

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.800
from this sort of right click and save mentality where you know A I could take that photograph

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:49.760
and B you know the photography community has traditionally sold prints um which I as an aside

01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.880
I think is highly conducive to additions which we'll get into but you know the photography

01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:00.160
community has done generally sold made money through selling of prints and that's because they

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:04.480
are easy to mass produce you take a photograph and you can you know mass produce these in a much

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:10.240
easier way than you can a single oil painting obviously so I want to get your views and I'm

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:14.960
going to throw this open to whoever wants to go first but I'd like to get your views on on what

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:22.800
really fundamentally changed with NFTs number one and number two how do you think NFTs will

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:27.680
impact photography going forward because of that

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.840
so again whoever wants to go first

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:47.760
um I'll take it um so I think that I do think that provenance is the biggest thing for

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:55.360
uh photographs in the web three space that has changed for us because

01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:03.760
it's one of those things where now we do have a recorded record of this is my image

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:10.560
and I can I can put it out in a way where it can never really be it can never truly be right click

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.680
and stolen you know again no one I now have this on the blockchain thing

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:24.240
hey I created this I made this and whether I sell it or not it doesn't really matter like I can

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:31.360
put it out there in a format where everybody knows time stamp and everything this is when I put

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:42.960
this image out to the world I think that that is um a big part of uh what has drawn

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:54.960
on photographers to web three I do think I do think part of it is also just a new um

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:03.360
a new I guess a new audience for photography as well because I think when you're constantly

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:13.280
uh trying to sell photography to a certain audience or whatever um having an audience come around

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:18.160
and say maybe there is something more here just a consideration alone for photographers is a big

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:27.360
deal because um we are normally used to having our work condensed down to like well anybody could

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:35.200
take this or you know anyone with a camera can go and take this photo and that is why I think just

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.640
a fresh perspective uh has caused there to be a second book at photography um

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.920
it's hard to say this is actually a tough question now that I think about it and I'm talking about it

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:58.560
um but I'm gonna sit on my thoughts for a few more minutes and see if I can um

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:04.400
kind of let this marinate a little bit more in my mind if any of the other two want to do

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:09.120
yeah fair enough um a blessing or Priyanka did you have something to add

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:17.280
yeah I can add something um the first question was what do you think has changed

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:21.440
um to work through your photography was that the question?

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:26.000
yeah that's the question and then and then the follow on if you want to

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.640
tackle it as well is what do you think this implies for the future of photography?

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:44.000
um I think for photography well since I left this started I mean photography hasn't really

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.280
gotten a lot of like we've been saying here lots of um audience I mean web 3 but as time has gone

01:04:51.280 --> 01:05:00.480
I think um last year it really got seen in a way and I think what has changed is just um allowing

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:09.680
us photographers um like the same goes like repoly so in the sense that um we're able to

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:18.640
get what we're worth in terms of like being able to sell our work in prices that we see

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:26.480
our work being worth it I mean before web 3 we usually would just um take pictures and then

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:35.600
post them on social media on instagram twitter wherever you post your work and you know the

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:41.520
the highest you would get is like maybe comments which is really amazing you know people commenting

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.240
on your work on how real work is or do you know what can people just say in your work but I think

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:53.440
we we're we're able to um not just have our work in like in a vault where you know it's

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.640
time stamp like drift said you know that this is our work and you know from yes to come it's

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:07.280
always going to be there I'm able to um sell our work in what we think is worth you know I'm in

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:15.680
the space and I mean the stabbing the stabbing the stabbing artist is still there but um just

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:21.760
being able to just being able to you know get something for yourself you know not just being

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:27.120
the artist that just put your pictures on social media and probably like maybe so I mean before

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:33.920
now I usually would just sell prints and I'll make like 20 30 highest hundred dollars for my work

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:40.880
but now like I'm able to see the worth of my work I know that I'm able like I can actually um

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:47.200
not just get a career from here but build something for myself and even for my family through

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:53.120
photography like it's changing my life it's giving me opportunities I'm now able to create work

01:06:53.120 --> 01:07:00.320
you know not feeling limited not having money to to go to where I want to go or buy the materials

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.960
I'm in need for my work so we're NFT I'm able to you know help myself and also help my family

01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:16.000
and in whatever way I can um and also um yeah it's just I think it's just a it's just being great

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:24.080
and for for for us photographers you know just also um have more audience from around the world

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.400
just see our work and connecting people I've been able to connect with so many amazing people

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:34.160
through this space as well not just um making money but like like when the money goes we still

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:41.120
have people we communicate with we're able to like I think we essentially um Sean that I met in this

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:47.520
space created like an amazing project um with photographers where he was able to you know photograph

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:52.560
um photographers from around the world to create a work just and he called these them I think

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.040
close that together you know so we're stuff like that we're able to just connect with people

01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:04.240
make something for ourselves and yeah so as time goes I'm just hoping that you know we're seeing

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:10.240
more and not just um like even like the underdogs in the space like the photographer because I

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:15.520
feel like there's so many amazing photographers that they haven't yet been seen in the space

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:21.680
so hopefully in time like we get more lights on photographers and people see that there's actually

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.560
passion in this the much of people going around and taking photographs but people are actually

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.040
very passionate about their work like I leave and breathe photography like I think I want to

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:37.280
all the time to something I love that even if the money is gone tomorrow because I started without

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.160
making anything from photography that even if I don't make anything from me tomorrow I will still

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:48.240
be creating works that tell the stories that I want to that I want to be told you know over time

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:54.880
so yeah I just hope in the future like we you know we're seeing more and I'm speaking from

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:02.720
for myself yeah and for people that I feel like I also in the place where um because

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:08.880
a lot of us aren't really seen so hopefully in time like you know more photographers I've seen

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:13.280
more photographers that are haji service so there's a word

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.200
exposure yes more exposures for photographers that are still

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:28.480
does it does it does it work? I'm sorry um just actors that are still new but creating amazing

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:34.320
works they're seeing you know over time so yeah I just hope for the best and hopefully maybe this

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:40.720
year we'll see what happens in this space but yeah that's my take on it that's great Priyanka did you

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.120
have anything you wanted that yeah yeah um place points are always blessing and just um I wanted

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:55.440
to talk a little bit more about um how um photography and activities and um have that changed um

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:05.120
a lot of emerging artists um where um they put a lot of photographers it was the first time

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.480
that they were getting this validation that their art is worth everything that they go to to make it

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:21.520
happen um and I think knowing that it pushed it happened for apologies and what they were able to

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:32.400
create um and they started um like finally like uh uh doing more projects um that allowed more

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:40.560
creative freedom um which like without anything or without getting that support from studying

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:49.520
their photos as entities was otherwise not possible like I know a lot of um photographers um so I'm

01:10:49.520 --> 01:11:00.080
um mainly with emerging uh emerging artists um who enter the space um feeling like they probably

01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:06.880
like may get lost may get lost in like the in the noise but then they finally found their stance

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:16.800
and um they finally believe that their art is um worth it I think that's like the key

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:24.320
uh point that I wanted to stress on um for me personally it was also about pushing boundaries um

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:33.600
I mainly uh shared my landscape and cityscape work when I started NFEs but then um I got a

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.600
chance to collaborate with world of women uh to shoot portraits um they were they were like

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.240
styled portraits it's something that I've wanted to do for a really long time but just for world of

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:51.040
bermani precisely but um it's something that I've wanted to do when I started home in India um

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:57.440
but I never really pushed myself to like go find a model and a stylist and make a pilot to put

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:03.040
everything together and do it but when I was asked by the team of world of women to be a part of this

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:10.160
amazing collection um it helped me push my boundaries and um do these portraits that that I was

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:19.600
potentially doing for the first time ever so um that is also key like um a lot of uh I know I

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:30.240
know a lot of photographers who started taking um more trips from whatever they earned and started

01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:37.200
exploring more just so they just so they could like um like finally go to the places that I've

01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:42.720
always wanted to go and uh shoot or shoot the projects that they have always wanted to shoot

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:50.400
they bring together a team and make it happen so I think um creative freedom and pushing boundaries

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:56.560
is like a huge thing like health uh photographers uh when it comes to NFEs

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.120
yeah I think that it's a really interesting part there's a it's called a flywheel effect

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:08.640
and especially in the photography community now that I'm seeing where you know for example blessing

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:17.440
is shooting photography on an iPhone the more exposure the more she's able to reach out to her

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:26.160
fan base and and sell photographs uh NFTs she can make money to upgrade her camera and that allows

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.720
you Priyanka as you were saying to push your artistic process and to uh explore new mediums

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:38.560
which I think is one of the coolest things about web3 it's empowering creators and I can think of

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:44.240
fewer better examples of that than in the photography community so I'm really happy to hear you say

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:51.680
that um as a reminder if you have a question in the audience type it in the chat or put it as a

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:58.800
hashtag NFTQNA on Twitter and it'll get flagged I have a one question now from the audience I'd

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:04.640
like to throw out to you guys and then I'd like to do something fun here um to wrap up a bit of a

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:10.880
lightning round um the question I have from the audience actually I have a couple questions we'll

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:18.720
do these um how do you get your work known how do you get more exposure to the community what's

01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:25.920
what's your best way or favorite way to um to get more known in the community and again this is open

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:37.440
forum anybody can jump in well I think there's a couple different ways but I mean if it's

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.440
if it's just getting your work known in the community I I think community involvement's a

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:49.920
big like the biggest thing I mean it seems kind of obvious but it can't be understated that you know

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:58.080
you have to like placement it's a lot of things you know um visibility and places where you want to

01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:07.520
be at is a big deal you know and so just getting yourself entrenched in the community and then

01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.040
going out of your way to actually be vulnerable and share your work connect with other people

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:24.880
is a big deal too but I think that my response to this is is not a very popular one but I think

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:33.920
that for artists looking to quote unquote be better known or what have you that that the right

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:43.600
answer is at least to me is always going to be just work on being excellent right and because if

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:51.840
if you are excellent if you are producing excellent work by and large when you

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:59.520
step into the vulnerability of sharing that work with the world you will naturally attract

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:08.000
because you are rising above and because you are separating yourself to create a body of work that

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:15.520
is one of a kind right and as artists I feel like that's what we ought to be doing you know and in a

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:24.640
day and an age where everybody is looking around at everybody else like be that person that is just

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:31.680
you know like kind of has the blinders on and is just there in your own zone creating

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.760
the best thing you can possibly create and when you create it did you go back to a drawing board

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.640
and you you know keep competing with yourself to get better and better and better because

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:50.000
it's easy and especially in the web 3 space it's easy to just get stuck in an echo chamber of like

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:57.440
and like this guy is it is like being visible or being supportive or artists supporting artists or

01:16:57.440 --> 01:17:04.880
whatever but that's not what is going to separate you in the way of light you want the world to

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.320
know you as an artist whether you're in the web 3 space or not outright excellence is going to

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:17.600
do that just like when we were talking about earlier with you know you know what is going to

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:24.240
separate you know photographers you know to where in a traditional art world and whatnot and I think

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:30.960
the answer is always going to be just being the best at what you do I don't think that I think if

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:37.280
you build your base on you know I'm grinding online to try to get into a community then you're

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:42.320
grinding for acceptance you're not attracting it you're not attracting something you're chasing

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:48.640
something and at all points in time you want to be attracting because your work is that good you know

01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:55.760
and I'll be honest like I if I have a qualm with the web 3 space and with like artists in it I think

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:02.400
this is like my qualms where it's like I think that visibility is confused with productivity and

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:09.840
as dangerous as artists because you should be spending more time with your work and more time out there

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:17.200
hunting you know and hunting for you know what a hunting and being after the pursuit of your vision

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:25.280
and you know the pursuit of excellence then trying to gain acceptance or sales or whatever online

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:29.360
you know and it's easy to get wrapped up and said because all of us want economic freedom all of

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:34.480
us want the money to go out and you know produce a larger vision like we were just talking about

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.960
and that's one of the best things in the web 3 space right but the foundation should be

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:44.640
and should continue to be outright excellence right if you're just that good you will never

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:51.360
have to worry about those other things it will just naturally come to you right I heard it said once

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:56.800
like you never have to advertise a fire right and the reason they like impassion the fire is because

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:03.840
like when passion and purpose has its work in you you will just naturally get that good you won't quit

01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:09.920
you won't take the days off like you'll just continue showing up for yourself and showing up for your

01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:17.360
purpose until people start realizing like hey this person is really really good and I think that

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:24.960
artists either fall into like a couple different traps either they never take the time or the

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:32.880
dedication to get that good or they start working on it and they quit before they ever like have that

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:39.680
breakthrough point and that's not saying like be anti-social and don't get involved but it's saying

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:45.920
like recognize what the priority is you know and the priority is I'm going to be the best artist I

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:52.480
can possibly be and attract everything else attract the collectors and attract the other artists

01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:57.920
supporting me in a track and if it's not authentic then why would you want it if it was built on

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.840
just visibility in the community and and just trading likes and retweets and stuff like that

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:07.600
you don't even want that because it's inauthentic or you shouldn't want that because it's inauthentic

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.840
right but if it's built off genuine love and connection over like hey I recognize and I respect

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:20.480
the level of excellence you are putting out the level of work the level of time level of dedication

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:25.440
the level of sacrifice that you have put into being this good of an artist I respect it

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:34.000
both from other artists and from collectors that's what you want right and it's easy to get caught up

01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:43.680
because everybody sees dollar signs and everybody sees you know uh you know having like popularity

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:49.520
in this niche micro section of the internet and stuff like that but like think bigger think

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.720
think a lot bigger than that think about not not just what you're doing in this space but what

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:03.360
you're doing in the world and I think when it comes down to it's like we are or should be after the

01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:10.000
pursuit of excellence at all times just letting love drive us to be that good and we will see

01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:16.960
naturally as you come and you finish when you you know you have the balance to have your time

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:22.400
online and put your workout and engage and do those types of things naturally you will see

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:29.760
the gravitational pull that your sacrifice has had and and your work I think it's better you'll see

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.960
okay now I'm starting to get the support now I'm starting to get the collectors it just takes

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:41.600
time and it just takes effort but if it's built on anything else it's probably not worth having a

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:45.840
build on because whatever you build the foundation on is whatever can crumble it at the end of the

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:55.920
day too you want it just built on outright respect outright excellence and just love and I don't feel

01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:00.240
like that's preaching up in the web through space I don't feel like it's preaching up to artists in

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:07.120
general because everything we have is inside of our everything we need is inside of ourselves

01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:16.160
and it's our jobs to go and dig it up and produce and bring forth a body of work to the world and I

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:21.920
think we should all be after that so sorry for my mini-ramp but that's what I think no that was

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:29.120
an excellent response I think that there's an aspect to web three where it's so new and the gains

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:35.440
were so quick and the photography community has been I don't want to say disrespected but

01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:42.400
but not quite at the same level as the traditional art community for so long that it's very very

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:50.400
difficult for photographers to enter this space and not see oh my god you know dollar signs and

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:56.000
drift I think you summed it up extremely well that it's it is hard to look to the long term but it is

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:04.640
by far the best indicator of future success I think and I think you you said it better than I can

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.880
even summarize it so I'll leave it there Priyanka I'm blessed I wanted to give you an opportunity

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:14.400
to respond to this as well if you had any thoughts and if you don't that's fine too but if you did

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:20.800
well I'd love to hear from you. Yeah it's actually difficult to follow what drift is said I guess

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:30.000
both sides I always think it's like a mic drop speech but I would like to answer this from a point

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.040
where it actually depends like I'm not sure who the person is who asks this like if they're only

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:44.000
starting out with their photography or like with their art medium and they just want to know how to

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:51.600
like dive into the community because I have talked to a lot of people who just join and they were

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:59.200
finding it difficult just leaving like find a community and like just basic struggle of like

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:05.760
finding people to interact with and like where do they start so apart from like all the creative

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:14.720
stuff on like whatever drift said I would just like to add like one key thing for web

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:24.640
tree especially and it's because it was in our hands to decide how we want our community to be

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:37.280
like outside of web 2 it's always been like community is it is like key to how use how your

01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:44.800
experience will be like in this space like focus on like finding your people like it was really

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:52.960
had I entered entities without knowing a few photographers from twitter already it would have

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:59.760
been difficult for me as an introverted person to even go and be in someone and just say hi even

01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:07.360
and make new people so like I think the key thing is like finding your people and people that

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:18.160
share the same values as you do and like that's like the first step like of course you show up

01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:26.240
every day you share your art you try to improve on your art every every chance you get all of these

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:34.080
things they're there but like from from the community perspective it's just the little things that

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:43.680
you do and and like always do it like I don't know how they say this but um you do things for

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:49.120
the community without expecting anything in the end to turn like nothing at all you just do it

01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:56.960
because you want to and you show up because you want to not because you have to um as in when you

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:01.920
are like improving on your clock and you keep showing when people will notice you there's no way that

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:10.400
excellent art will get go unnoticed even with emerging artists it's just a matter of dying

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:17.040
um I know everyone hates like even I did but everyone hates being told you have patience

01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:24.320
but it truly truly takes a lot of patience together if very few people like a very small

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:33.440
percentage of people will find that fame where they go popular like just right away um and it's

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:42.640
okay to not be on that same vibe as that person um you just have to be okay with how your journey

01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:52.160
in art um goes like um yeah great answer thank you Priyanka blessing did you have anything you

01:26:52.160 --> 01:27:02.800
wanted to add um yeah um so I would like to take a small route to this question in the sense of

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:10.400
where I'm from and all of this yeah yeah um so um yeah great great I don't well

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:17.200
putting yourself out there is one thing and you know being accepted is another thing and

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:23.520
um I don't want to seem to be like a sad thing but it's just like from my own perspective

01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:30.880
someone from this continent um it's been really um I think it's it's kind of difficult

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:37.440
to be involved um coming from this other side side of the world in this space because um to an

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:44.960
extent um it's really hard for us to get seen even regardless of how much we put ourselves out there

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.840
you know our self and our work out there um it's pretty difficult I think even to the points where

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:59.440
I think yesterday you know there was an issue with somebody um trying to sell their work and

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:04.800
being told you know because of where you're from you're not meant to sell your work for this particular

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:13.280
amount which is it is harder to hear because I mean like we're talking about like it takes a lot

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:18.400
for you to create a piece and to to value your work in the way you feel like your work should be

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:27.440
valued so like Priyanka said it's finding your people in the space and just you know finding

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:34.640
people that accept you which takes time because again from where I'm from it takes time when you

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.760
would even accept you or accept the work that you do because to an extent they don't see you in

01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.760
how do I say this I'm not trying to design you know they don't see you in the sense that you can

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:56.160
create a museum work because you're from a certain part of the world so you really have to over push

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:02.480
yourself over work yourself to be seen and even on that level you're still not taking seriously

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:09.200
because of where you're from so a lot of us are in the space um not just me I mean I think people

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.880
from other parts of the world really find it difficult you know being seen or being heard in

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.880
the space because of where they're from I think that plays a big impact in people's working with

01:29:20.880 --> 01:29:28.480
three so I don't know if that's ever going to change but I'm hoping that you know as the time

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:33.120
go because like like I keep saying like you know we're still very early we're three we're three

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:39.760
still we're still very early so hopefully as time goes you know we are you know being appreciated

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:48.400
for what we create and not where we're from to determine like the kind of what we create so yeah

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:55.840
I think that's my own inputs but yeah just what fighting sorry no I was just sorry to interrupt

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:00.720
you I was just going to ask you a follow up to that and then I want to jump to a different topic but

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:06.160
just very quickly blessing I mean I can't imagine trying to overcome some of the barriers of web

01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:13.200
three being from Nigeria as an up and coming and outstanding photographer what has been your most

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:20.720
successful strategy for tackling that that exposure barrier? So I'm not really good with

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:27.760
like business parts of photography because I'm just like I just love to create so I think also

01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:36.400
web three has you know we've just been into web three has made me maybe understand it to be more

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:42.960
like putting myself out there I'm sure in my work more than I used to because I'm very shy and you

01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:48.640
know so I've been able to put myself out there more I don't think I have a particular strategy

01:30:48.640 --> 01:30:54.720
other than just sharing my work and hoping that you know whoever who whoever does the work and

01:30:54.720 --> 01:31:01.520
appreciates the work for fortitude you know finds the work but like yeah I don't think I have any

01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:08.000
like strategy or doing anything different I just put my work out there share my stories I used to

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:12.480
go into like shame and space I don't think they do that anymore but I used to go into shooting spaces

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:19.920
before I just you know share my story share my work but it wasn't really doing it lots because

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:26.640
again like I said I feel like when I mean there are so many success stories from people from

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:32.560
from people in Africa here or in Nigeria doesn't mean it does made sales I'm done

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:38.000
incredible for themselves but it's still very difficult for a lot of us from this side of the

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:46.320
world because I don't know there's just this stereotype when it comes to people from this

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:51.520
part of the world and I'm just hoping that change but I don't really think I have like a particular

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:58.320
strategy when I just share my work and hope that you know whatever happens happens yeah yeah I kind

01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:02.320
of along the lines of what Drift was saying where it's just persistent excellence in your work

01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.080
Priyanka I know you wanted to add something yeah

01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:14.320
yeah actually so I think I love that you've brought that up and I think I was too nervous

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:20.720
and I can't believe you've learned but I also wanted to talk about this a little bit more because

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:29.360
being a South Asian photographer a lot of my friends who are from in there on other parts of

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:35.120
South Asia last December I'm not sorry about December December 2021 we all the first

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:44.400
felt like we were just like speaking into the void and it was going nowhere so like we all just

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:49.360
like directly decided that okay we need to do something to fix this and like do spotlight

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:56.000
like give every artist that like we knew there was just a tour of Lucha that we were talking

01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:03.440
about our personal experiences about the space and everything so I just came up with the idea

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:09.840
that okay let's do one thing let's pick an artist a day and we will share his or her work and

01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:17.360
we will see how that goes and there were 34 of us who did this for almost two months we did it

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:25.200
every other day and we did end up getting a few sales for a for a bunch of us which was amazing

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:38.160
to see but I think just finding creative ways to help get the art scene is key like this is why

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:45.440
we formed the Borrowy Lefty as well like we wanted to help emerging artists underrepresented

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:53.680
artists to get seen and it all started with me just asking on Twitter like

01:33:53.680 --> 01:34:01.760
this was back in July 2021 when I felt like I was like really like alone and there were not many

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:07.840
facilitation photographers in this space I just tweeted saying that okay I'm just waiting for someone to

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:17.200
like finally like bring some spotlight on to the foundation photographers in the space because

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:29.920
I felt really alone and then I had this friend Samjae he's a he's a Korean American artist he just

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:35.920
replied to my tweet saying that hey okay that's that me horse is space just spotlight

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:41.120
photographers from India and we can do it in on cyber he hadn't he had a gallery

01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:48.240
and then I started looking for other Indian photographers in the space and we had this group

01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:53.680
of like 25 people that that I could put together and we did a spotlight space for each one of us

01:34:53.680 --> 01:35:01.200
and I think that was the first time I think 6 5 2 9 was also had a very new account on Twitter

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:09.280
and that was the first time I think he came across this space that we were hosting and I still

01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:16.400
remember all of us do that he just commented nice and we didn't enjoy 5 times like we were like okay

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:26.080
and then it went from that one Twitter space where all of us talked about our work that was

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:31.920
being exhibited in all cyber gallery to us spotlighting each other a couple of months later because

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:39.840
we we firstly found out people in in that tiny group of the in that small group on our Twitter chat

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:49.600
to them forming the borough and dropping our first collection of curated art which sold out

01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:56.160
on the day of the job which was nothing that we ever expected like the bear market has just hit us

01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.880
and we had no idea if you were going to sell out even like we thought it would take like a week

01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:08.160
or two weeks or a month even to sell out because all of us were emerging audience except for a

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:16.240
couple of them that had that were already on to bread or they were well known so we we didn't

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:24.640
really know what the outcome of the job was going to be like but it's um I feel like incredibly blessed

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:32.320
but we sold out the like in less than 40 minutes which is pretty amazing and um that started like

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:42.160
a whole new journey for the borough and saltation artists in this space and it's been incredibly

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:50.080
so far that's great that's a great tip and also congratulations I would just add something real

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:54.080
quick and then I wanted to move on to the lightning round because we were running out of time in

01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:58.880
fortunately but um real quick I would just add that you know there's a lot of people on twitter

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:04.880
who post GM in the morning good morning 6 5 2 9 posted every single morning uh barat who's on our

01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:11.440
team posted every single morning um when you reply GM if you're an artist and you reply GM my

01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:18.000
suggestion is reply GM and post of uh one of your pieces of work it's not chilling it's kind of like

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:26.720
a signature so you know GM sincerely bat soup yum um and that I've actually found quite a bit of

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:33.760
work as a collector just scrolling through twitter feeds and seeing in a non-intrusive non-shilling

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:39.280
type of environment just oh wow this is a really nice piece and then you click on the profile and

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:44.240
you click on their link tree or what have you um and I that's a suggestion I have just it when you

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:50.800
respond to a GM thread or a thread that is not really that topic specific just you know when you

01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:56.560
respond to it also post of one of your pieces and I think that's been a good way to get exposure um

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:59.680
I would like to move on to the lightning round but blessing I think you wanted to add something real

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:09.360
quick um yeah so just I just wanted to add to um just having this in the space um so I just wanted

01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:17.040
to highlight um so one of the things that was able to bring some of us to like the limelight

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:22.560
at the time was when I think we signed to Copeland himself to work have this initiative where

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:29.760
it was street tasers where he was able to just highlight like incredible assets in the space

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:36.320
um just buying their works and proving that you know incredible walks in con from people around

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:43.360
the world not just like a particular place so I just wish like you know more people can

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:50.880
just take upon themselves to like highlight highlights other artists in the space and also like um

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:56.720
you know find take the time to like look for artists not just the ones that they know but like just go

01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:01.360
and actually look for us because we're here and you know hopefully everything changed

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:07.200
so just go on to that thank you. Great thank you for following up blessing okay we're gonna do

01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:10.880
something fun here real quick and there's a couple more questions that need to be answered and I'm

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:16.560
gonna answer have you guys answer them in a lightning round format and what I mean by that is I'm

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.880
going to throw out a topic and then um anybody can go it's open forum but I would like you to limit

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:30.400
your response to no more than 60 seconds okay so let's see and then we will wrap up so I'll do

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:36.960
like three or four of these topics let's start with additions drift I know you've done an addition

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:43.280
very successfully in the past there are additions it seems like every time I open my twitter feed

01:39:43.280 --> 01:39:48.880
there's an addition that they are very very popular right now and I personally believe a

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:53.840
fantastic way for an artist to connect with their community I'm curious your thoughts on them

01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:06.800
okay my thoughts are artists focus on your one-of-one work first um because your one-of-one work is going to

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:16.640
a start building out your collector base gives you a an idea of letting the market decide some of the

01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:22.080
value for your work you start to get feedback on you know how good is my work you know what's it

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:30.080
being valued at and whatnot and then focus on just connecting with different people and and

01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:35.840
getting your work out there and focus on your additions after you've focused on your one-of-ones

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:46.480
it's not popular but I think that it's a very good model if using your additions as a way to target

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:53.760
people of different that have different budgets to spend I think is the best way to do it and you

01:40:53.760 --> 01:41:01.440
do that by kind of to me by kind of starting with the one-of-ones and working your way down to

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:06.800
different levels of additions different addition counts etc so that's what I would say and I think

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:14.080
that they're a wonderful way to connect with people that have certain amounts of money to spend

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:17.920
make your work accessible to a lot of different people and broaden your collector base

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:27.920
yeah um so yeah I definitely agree like it's an amazing way to

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:35.200
involve the community around you and like make it make your art accessible to them it doesn't

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:43.680
matter like what the amount is it's mainly about making your art accessible for people who've

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:54.080
always wanted to support you but they couldn't buy your one-of-ones so I think and even for me

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:59.520
personally I realized that back in like August 2021 when I released my first edition it was an

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:06.960
edition of 10 and a decent device edition so and I had no idea if it was I was gonna sell like only

01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:14.960
a couple or anything but like good of it I know like I had friends who had been meaning to guys

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:21.920
my work but couldn't so and it told out in a day so I was like that was the first like my aha

01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:28.400
moment like okay wait um I do have people who want to support me but not necessarily get my one-of-ones

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:36.800
so um I think that was the first time um editions really like um entered my um like my um like my

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.840
I don't know like my afy eagles I guess

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.560
great blessing did you have anything that you want to add

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:54.400
I'm still finding my way with edition but I think it's like everyone has said I think it's a great way

01:42:54.400 --> 01:43:03.920
to also like maybe friends um and people that can't afford your one-of-ones to get in and maybe

01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:08.240
support your your work in in that way so it doesn't have to be all the time

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:14.240
uh or like every now and then you can have something where people can just support um

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:20.800
yeah but I think I'm more of a one-of-one artist but I that's why yeah

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:28.720
yeah so I'm really confident that you think it's no problem no problem okay so the next topic is

01:43:28.720 --> 01:43:32.880
going to be a tough one um and again limit your responses in 60 seconds but this was a question

01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.760
for the audience and I'm we could spend an entire session on this but I'm going to throw it out

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:44.960
there uh with for a quick response AI AI and its impact on particularly photography

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:57.200
oh okay that's really really tough one um I think um I think it's going to help my

01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:05.360
for for photographers who wanted to you know like explore and travel but they cannot like I know

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.080
a lot of people who who wanted to travel but they just cannot because of their circumstances

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:17.920
it definitely gives them this whole other medium to create work that they would have had they been

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:23.040
able to travel so I think it's it's great that AI is giving them that I know uh competent

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:29.120
put on feel like making collages also one of those but like creating what you see in your in your

01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:36.160
mind and and using AI to build that as a an add on to your photograph it's it's an amazing thing

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.120
that we have here so um I think it's a great thing

01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:51.680
I would agree with Priyanka I see AI is not necessarily a replacer of photography but as an

01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:59.760
addition maybe to you know take a photograph and then use AI to reimagine it into something

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:06.000
great or big or I think that there could be a lot of interest there some people would argue

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.680
that it takes away from the photograph I would argue that it could be possible to make an even

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:19.280
greater piece of art uh than with the assistance of AI I don't know if I would necessarily

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:24.480
you couldn't contribute at all to photography at that point but you could still

01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:30.880
uh contribute it to be an artistic creation so I think that there could be some really cool world

01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:39.760
from Mok there great blessing did you have anything one of that um yeah I yeah like everyone I said

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:49.280
I think AI is pretty interesting um like jitter said I think I mean everything in life has its

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:56.800
advantage and disadvantage so it's it's how we use how we use them and how we go about them so

01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:04.640
I I think with AI for photographers you know if you have like like like a like for me now a visual

01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:10.640
artist or I have a story I want to tell but like I can't you know picture it or imagine me so I

01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:17.840
can go to AI and you know just type in what I'm thinking before I'm able to like maybe construct

01:46:17.840 --> 01:46:24.080
my work and go out in the field to create a story so I think it has that advantage and

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:30.800
probably that disadvantage I really don't know but so far I don't think it's just going to like

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:38.560
take over photography or anything in that sense because um yeah at the end of the day um there's

01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:45.200
this name that's the original will always be the original so yeah I don't think it's changing anything

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:51.280
maybe I didn't say but I don't think it's really changing I find it fascinating that the three of

01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:57.520
you have such a positive stance on AI I think um I think a lot of folks are afraid of it and

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:04.000
and a lot of artists are keeping a very open mind about it so that that was a really interesting

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:11.840
response but let's do two more um platform yeah go ahead blessing I was going to say it I mean

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:19.040
before photography you know we used to um it was there was a it was painting you know with your

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.480
pin brush and and then photography came you know people were scared like or will photography

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:32.640
take over you know arts itself like painting and then digital arts came so I mean I don't see

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:39.120
anything like really really changing so I don't think there's anything to be scared of if you know

01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.920
what you're doing I don't think you should be scared when you know what you're doing I don't so

01:47:44.720 --> 01:47:50.400
yeah that's what I wanted to answer yeah yeah a great great response great response um

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:57.440
okay two more and then we'll wrap up um platform I know a lot of folks are using artists are using

01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:03.680
their own contract now um and I'm curious if you have had an experience you know using the different

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:09.760
platforms you know for an upcoming artist for you know advice to collectors or what have you

01:48:09.760 --> 01:48:13.840
how do you feel about the various platforms that are out there and selling through them

01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:26.400
um so I think with the wonderful making it like very accessible for like a lot of artists to

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:34.240
um make sure that they have their own smart contracts it's been a game changer since like last

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:44.800
December and um I think no matter what platform you decide or you choose to list it on um as long

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:53.120
as um even if you're a new artist just like ask around and like um like they made it really easy

01:48:53.120 --> 01:49:01.200
for anyone to figure out how to deploy the contract and mint and everything so um just

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:08.160
irrespective of what platform you decide to sell on um having your own smart contract is going to be

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:15.840
very very important like two five ten years down the line um that's one thing that you

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:22.800
like any artist even join your space now um need to remember I know OpenSea used to be like

01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:30.160
the first point of entry for anyone joining um but that's changed since uh medical became um

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.480
medical became available to everyone to use um yeah

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:49.280
can I add to yes please um so I for me I think um just having different platforms is great and

01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:55.600
also it's mindful like you have new contracts for your work is amazing because um you know um

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:02.000
your success story may come from from anywhere it can be on foundation I've seen people that you

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.360
know have works on this platform and you know didn't even say well nothing like that happened but

01:50:07.360 --> 01:50:14.480
like you know they tried this platform and you're doing so well on that so I think it helps with like

01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:20.400
you just try not new things because this is a space to you know meet people and also just try

01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:27.200
to put yourself out there because if if your audience isn't here your audience would definitely

01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:32.720
be somewhere else so not limiting yourself to just one place I think in this is where your

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:39.280
success story or your or your success may come from so I mean even to the point as as down to like

01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:46.240
Solana and Tesos you know so and they also have to like meetings so people that kind of

01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:53.440
forwards to meet on Ethereum you know their means on Tesos or Solana which you know I don't think

01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:57.920
there's a lot of money we spend on like the other platforms so I think just having different

01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:02.320
platforms and people just being able to try different things to see where and where works for

01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:10.160
them is is great so you know tonight oh you're pretty glad great great drift did you want to add

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:19.600
anything yeah I would say when you're first starting out I think that it is important to keep an

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:26.560
open mind to different platforms because each platform can provide different things you know

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.840
when I first came into the space you know I was on foundation I was on super air I have you know

01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:40.240
a collection and an addition on open sea you know but I think that the whole you know one of the

01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:46.960
ethos of web 3 or one of the things we should be working towards is you know liberation of the

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.240
artist and artists being more autonomous right and so we need to take that thinking into the

01:51:52.240 --> 01:51:58.160
platforms that we use to and this is something I wish I would have looked at and paid attention to

01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:05.920
sooner and 2021 and you know early 2022 when you know we were still in this outrageous bull market

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:15.440
you know but I think that I think every artist goal should be to be completely autonomous at the

01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:21.600
end of the day to where we are building on our own smart contracts releasing on building and

01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:28.000
releasing on our you know own sites and stuff like that and that's why I think Manafort is

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:36.240
one of the best things to have happen to the space because it is truly there to give our it

01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:43.600
it reinforces the ethos that we talk about and in this space and it gives artists the tools to be

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:51.280
completely self-sufficient should they choose to be right and I think that's very important

01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:55.840
I think at first when you're first getting into things there's pluses and minuses to being on

01:52:55.840 --> 01:53:01.920
OpenSea or a super rare whatever you know be it curation or you know wanting to put different

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:08.480
bodies of works you know in different places but I think the long-term goal should be complete

01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:16.800
autonomy over our work how we sell it royalties everything along those lines right and so

01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:26.400
I'm not just my thought on that yeah yeah yeah great responses you guys I really appreciate that

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:32.160
well this is a nice segue into my final question and the final topic we'll cover before we close

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.880
if we were sitting here last year I think one of the responses to this question would be

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:44.480
what you just said drift and the question is as follows if you could change one if you could

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:50.880
if there's one thing in web 3 that you are most looking forward to to either advance your work

01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:56.560
or advance the photography space what do you think that should be so for example drift you

01:53:56.560 --> 01:54:01.840
talked about you know minting on your own or you know minting on your own contract which was a

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:08.560
big step forward for artists in the space is there something else like that that is looming out there

01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:12.640
that you're really excited about or you think should happen or you're really looking forward

01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:19.280
to that would really again help your work or advance photography even further what else can be built

01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:28.560
what else can be done well I definitely am looking forward to you know more artists

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:36.080
you know getting on manifold and and taking taking their ownership over their work that they not only

01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:44.880
deserve but you know should desire as well but I think my answer might be a little bit different

01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:51.440
than what people would expect but one of the things I'm looking forward to the most is just

01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:56.800
the space is so new and so fast paced and so

01:54:56.800 --> 01:55:08.160
and was like so volcanic when you know in 2021 early 2022 and there was a lot of money made

01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:16.960
and there was a lot of just there was a lot of just chaos if we're being honest right and now

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:23.200
you know the bear market gives people time for the dust to settle you know the tides kind of coming

01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:30.720
in you know and I think one of the things it does is just curb unrealistic expectations

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:40.160
and I think that that is something that I am looking forward to seeing change for artists right

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:44.640
like you have artists come in the web 3 and they find success but what does success comes

01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:49.840
a huge amount of expectations for from people who maybe are not traditional art collectors

01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:58.400
or or have like made a good amount of money off this artist or whatever and so then there's an

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:03.200
expectation of visibility there's an expectation of you know providing different things there's an

01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:11.680
expectation of you know wanting the artist to be a certain way at any given point of time and I

01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:20.480
think that as time goes on it's going to show that like a like great art takes time it takes

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:28.240
not just time to make but it takes intention so that the artist can't always be everything

01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:34.560
that the space places expectations on them to be and I think that that has been hard and like

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:39.520
talking to other artists and like other artists that have found like a significant level of success

01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:45.360
like they've felt very similarly and so and it's hard to create art from that type of

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:51.840
standpoint and so I I think just time is what I'm looking forward to and seeing how that

01:56:52.640 --> 01:56:58.480
changes our expectation of what we should expect from artists I think it's amazing that artists

01:56:58.480 --> 01:57:06.080
are being equipped in these in new ways and like having resources in new ways but what's the point

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:13.040
if they don't have the time to take those resources and like put them into like a multi-year plan you

01:57:13.040 --> 01:57:20.000
know and then it's like if if the artist is doing that will you afford them time to execute that

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:27.040
vision will you afford them time to you know create what they're creating some people will you know

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.960
but because of the space and how fast it's moved and the money that's been created in the film

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:42.160
and the chaos a lot of times I don't feel like that's always been there and just speaking from

01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:47.840
personal experience it's like if I even just had to break down what the last two years have been like

01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:53.840
you know even outside of like you know like I really felt like okay I came to a point where like

01:57:53.840 --> 01:58:00.640
there's something wrong when like not just going through the past two years and everything I've had

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:05.360
to deal with but then also like dealing with the loss of like a sibling that I cared for and stuff

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:12.480
like that and I'm still getting like demands on like an open edition I did where I promise nothing

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:18.640
right that's like to me it's like okay there's a problem there there's like an illness there to

01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:23.200
where it's like what's the separation and I get that there's always going to be some people like

01:58:23.200 --> 01:58:28.160
that right and I get as an artist it's something that it's like a burden you have to carry at times

01:58:28.160 --> 01:58:34.880
but I'm just looking forward to when there's more years underneath our bill as a space to where we

01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:40.080
can see like okay this is what an artist has done over the course of not just one or two years but

01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:48.160
three five ten you know and we start to see like okay the long-term vision because I know for us

01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:58.000
we're thinking in terms of years decades lifetimes you know and I feel like because of how fast

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:04.240
things have turned and burned in this space that's a loss sometimes and to try to go and explain that

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.920
is exhausting and to try to like get people to see it through your eyes as an artist is exhausting

01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:16.560
and so a lot of times you just stick to no explanation at all like I just have to go and and do it and

01:59:16.560 --> 01:59:23.920
accept that people will understand it later so I think for me that's the biggest thing I'm looking

01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:30.160
forward to seeing change is just time and what time we'll do to people's perception of artists in the

01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:34.880
space and especially photographers what you see a photographer doing now might not be what you

01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:40.320
see them doing in five to ten years but are you trusting that they are out there working every

01:59:40.320 --> 01:59:45.200
similar day they're out there trying to be better I think we should be you know any of the artists

01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:50.640
that we're investing and we're investing in and them and who they are in their character and

01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:58.480
and our love for now and their work but but them and and where we see them going and the the character

01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:04.640
they've displayed to create this work you know so I'm I'm looking forward to that a lot

02:00:06.080 --> 02:00:10.720
yeah the bear market and maybe perhaps getting to normalize markets will allow everyone I think

02:00:10.720 --> 02:00:16.960
to take a deep breath and really focus on what matters and what's important in this space I think

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:22.560
that's a great response thank you for it and blessing and Prionka I want to clarify something

02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:27.200
here as well if if there's not a whole lot that you're thinking that you know hey I'm really looking

02:00:27.200 --> 02:00:32.720
forward to this any closing comments as well or certainly welcome so you know please feel free to

02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:38.240
you know avoid not necessarily answer the question directly and you know just comment on

02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:41.440
on you know life in general in the future and then we'll wrap up

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:43.440
so

02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:51.200
I just wanted to ask my quick thing that could take off like one thing that I'm looking forward to

02:00:51.200 --> 02:01:00.240
the most but the most but like the good thing to do is having more traditional collectors being

02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:08.800
on board in the next couple of years it's an incredibly difficult task but it's something we need

02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:15.280
for the space to thrive and feel bigger so that's one of the things that I'm looking forward to

02:01:16.960 --> 02:01:21.040
and yeah I just want to thank everyone for being here and joining me there

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:28.560
joining the talk and blessing and just thank you for sharing all your views about and your

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:34.480
artistic journey and that's really a thank you so much for hosting us it's been great thank you

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:36.480
thank you so much

02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:40.960
blessing if you had a closing comments as well we'd love to hear them

02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:50.480
um thank you so much um I think also for me what I like to see um as time goes just hopefully

02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:57.440
imagine artists just get more visibility to the space and just like Prank has said

02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:03.920
um having more traditional collectors or people that

02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:16.400
should I say value the arts a bit more in the space so that um yeah so so that we'll have

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:24.000
I don't know so that yeah so now we can just have like a different spectrum in the space of you

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:32.480
know the collectors we have now and just having more people come and hopefully get more opportunities

02:02:32.480 --> 02:02:40.080
from the space and I've been looking forward to this and I'm from Denys' space and just opening

02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:26.000
in future like a more

02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:50.960
space um yeah and just don't say thank you so much to everyone who came to listen to us and thank

02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:57.440
you to Brianna and Clark and to Drift and really thank you to you and

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:02.800
Valentino for putting this together it's been an amazing space just listen to everyone

02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:09.280
um talk about photography and you know the passion for arts it's just been incredible sorry
