00:00.000 --> 00:22.600
Hello everyone!

00:22.600 --> 00:29.600
So welcome to this 12th week of the University of Nicosias

00:29.600 --> 00:33.600
framework on NFTs and the metaverse.

00:33.600 --> 00:37.600
I'm Jody Agles and I'm honored and privileged to be joined by

00:37.600 --> 00:42.600
56529 as always.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.600
This is an important session today.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.600
It's not the last one in the course, as I will be explaining

00:50.600 --> 00:53.600
about the last couple of weeks.

00:53.600 --> 01:00.600
But today is the last of the, let's call them main or core

01:00.600 --> 01:03.600
sessions of this course.

01:03.600 --> 01:09.600
It's the 12th week of this program that 659 and I designed a few

01:09.600 --> 01:17.600
months ago to provide people with a holistic overview of the

01:17.600 --> 01:22.600
NFT and metaverse and web3 space.

01:22.600 --> 01:27.600
And you will be the judges of whether we've done a good job on

01:27.600 --> 01:29.600
that or not.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.600
I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank

01:34.600 --> 01:40.600
659 both for his great insights in designing the course and

01:40.600 --> 01:45.600
delivering this material, but also for his whole presence in

01:45.600 --> 01:47.600
this space.

01:47.600 --> 01:52.600
I think I'm not exaggerating if I say that he has been the

01:52.600 --> 01:58.600
person that has influenced our thinking on decentralization and

01:58.600 --> 02:02.600
the need for openness in web3 more than probably anyone else in

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
this space.

02:03.600 --> 02:07.600
Anyway, I would like to, the topic of today's metaverse 2030,

02:07.600 --> 02:13.600
so it's going to be really interesting to hear 659 views on

02:13.600 --> 02:18.600
the future of the internet and how it fits with the history of

02:18.600 --> 02:21.600
its development so far.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.600
But before doing that, I would like to start by giving you an

02:26.600 --> 02:32.600
update on course logistics since this is the last course session

02:32.600 --> 02:36.600
of the course and I know that many of you will have questions

02:36.600 --> 02:41.600
related to the final exam and how we're going to schedule the next

02:41.600 --> 02:44.600
few weeks from here.

02:44.600 --> 02:49.600
Before I start, let me say that as always this is a work in

02:49.600 --> 02:52.600
progress, this is an experiment that is happening live, we are

02:52.600 --> 02:58.600
experimenting on how to do a fully on-chain in the metaverse

02:58.600 --> 02:59.600
course.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.600
So I know that I'm not going to answer all your questions related

03:04.600 --> 03:06.600
to the exams today.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.600
There are some things that we're still thinking about and we will

03:09.600 --> 03:14.600
finalize in the coming weeks, but I'm going to give you our

03:14.600 --> 03:17.600
thinking as it is now.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.600
I'm going to announce a few things that you need to know in

03:21.600 --> 03:24.600
order to prepare and take the final exams.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.600
But if you have additional questions, please post them on

03:28.600 --> 03:35.600
Twitter, on Discord and in the OM today and in the next weeks.

03:35.600 --> 03:41.600
So even those questions that we will not answer today, we are

03:41.600 --> 03:46.600
creating an FAQ section both on the course website and on this

03:46.600 --> 03:50.600
court as a pinned message in the course channel.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.600
So we will be adding answers to your questions as they come

03:54.600 --> 03:57.600
along in the next few days and weeks.

03:57.600 --> 04:03.600
So let me start by addressing a little bit the final exam.

04:03.600 --> 04:08.600
First of all, I guess everyone will want to know when and where

04:08.600 --> 04:12.600
will the exams take place.

04:12.600 --> 04:18.600
We are, as I said, we have a couple of, not a couple, quite a few

04:18.600 --> 04:22.600
guest sessions following up in the next couple of weeks.

04:22.600 --> 04:27.600
So we are scheduling the exams for the second half of February.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.600
So between the 15th and the 28th of February, we will announce

04:32.600 --> 04:36.600
the exact date and time soon.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.600
What we do in other MOOCs, those of you that have taken one of

04:40.600 --> 04:44.600
University of Megosea's other MOOCs will know it, is that we

04:44.600 --> 04:49.600
usually keep the exam open for a full 24-hour period.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.600
So you will have like two hours to finish the exam from the time

04:53.600 --> 04:58.600
you started, but you can start it at any time during the day that

04:58.600 --> 04:59.600
the exam is open.

04:59.600 --> 05:03.600
I think this is the model that we will be following this time as

05:03.600 --> 05:07.600
well, but we'll give you details as soon as we have them.

05:07.600 --> 05:12.600
What I can say at this stage is that as we do everything in this

05:12.600 --> 05:16.600
course, the exam will be held on say, and I will explain later

05:16.600 --> 05:18.600
on what this means.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.600
Who can participate in the exam?

05:20.600 --> 05:23.600
You will need the course access token in your wallet.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.600
So as you know, we don't know you by name.

05:27.600 --> 05:32.600
We have registered students in this course by having everyone

05:32.600 --> 05:36.600
mint a course access token.

05:36.600 --> 05:41.600
We didn't, we made the decision not to use this token to

05:41.600 --> 05:44.600
to gate and control access to the course material.

05:44.600 --> 05:48.600
We wanted to have all the material available to everyone because

05:48.600 --> 05:52.600
this is, you know, the model of free education that we

05:52.600 --> 05:57.600
believe in, but you will need the course access token to be able

05:57.600 --> 05:58.600
to access the final exam.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.600
So make sure that you do have the token and you know in which

06:03.600 --> 06:07.600
wallet, in which Ethereum address this is stored because this

06:07.600 --> 06:12.600
is the Ethereum address with which you will need to log in the

06:12.600 --> 06:17.600
exam website when the time comes to take the exam.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.600
What's the format of the exam?

06:19.600 --> 06:23.600
It's going to be a multiple choice quiz, most likely consisting

06:23.600 --> 06:27.600
of 50 multiple choice questions.

06:27.600 --> 06:32.600
Each question having up to four possible answers of which in

06:32.600 --> 06:35.600
some questions one answer will be correct.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.600
Other questions might have multiple correct answers and the

06:39.600 --> 06:44.600
different types of questions will be noted in the exam.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.600
What is the passing grade?

06:45.600 --> 06:50.600
You will need to score 60% or higher in the exam in order to

06:50.600 --> 06:54.600
pass it and if you pass the exam and you want to do so, you

06:54.600 --> 07:00.600
will be able to claim the certificate of completion NFT that

07:00.600 --> 07:05.600
we will give to students that pass the exam.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.600
How will this certificate be sent?

07:08.600 --> 07:12.600
Those of you that have passed the exam will be allowed listed to

07:12.600 --> 07:16.600
meet the certificate as an Ethereum NFT as we've said from

07:16.600 --> 07:21.600
the beginning the minting course will be 0.25 Ether plus the

07:21.600 --> 07:27.600
gas fees that you will need to pay depending on the on the

07:27.600 --> 07:31.600
gas on Ethereum at the time of minting.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.600
Again, I need to stress that this is not a mandatory step.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.600
You can take the exam, you can pass the exam and still not

07:39.600 --> 07:43.600
claim the NFT certificate of completion so everything will

07:43.600 --> 07:48.600
be 100% free for you.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
How do you prepare for the exam?

07:49.600 --> 07:52.600
What material you need to study?

07:52.600 --> 07:56.600
We will be basing the multiple choice questions on the material

07:56.600 --> 07:59.600
that is included in the main presentation slides.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.600
When I say main presentation slides, I mean the 12 decks that

08:04.600 --> 08:09.600
comprise the weeks 1 to 12 of this course.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.600
All these presentations are accessible in GitHub.

08:13.600 --> 08:18.600
You know the address and it's also linked in the course website.

08:18.600 --> 08:24.600
And you may want to watch the video sessions in which

08:24.600 --> 08:29.600
6529i and guests have been presenting the slides.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.600
I think this will help you prepare the exam.

08:31.600 --> 08:36.600
But you should be able to take the exam and prepare for it by

08:36.600 --> 08:39.600
reading through the presentation slides.

08:39.600 --> 08:42.600
The guest sessions are optional.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.600
I think they have been super interesting.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.600
I think the ones that are coming up are also super interesting.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.600
But we will not have any questions drawing from material that

08:52.600 --> 08:56.600
has not been addressed in the main presentations and has only

08:56.600 --> 09:00.600
been discussed in the optional session.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.600
Some of you will not have the access token because they joined

09:04.600 --> 09:05.600
the course later.

09:05.600 --> 09:09.600
As I said, we made a decision not to make this mandatory, but

09:09.600 --> 09:12.600
we still want to take the exam.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.600
I'm afraid this is not possible.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.600
So you will not be able to take the exam unless you have the

09:18.600 --> 09:20.600
course access token.

09:20.600 --> 09:25.600
At this point in time, your best bet is to go to the secondary

09:25.600 --> 09:27.600
market and acquire it.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.600
It is pretty cheap.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.600
I mean, I sacked this morning and the floor price for the

09:34.600 --> 09:36.600
unique access token on open C was less than $5.

09:36.600 --> 09:41.600
So I hope this would not be an obstacle for anyone that wants

09:41.600 --> 09:42.600
to take the exam.

09:42.600 --> 09:47.600
If for any reason you do not want, you cannot acquire the

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
course access token, then your other option is obviously to wait

09:51.600 --> 09:53.600
until the next iteration of the course.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.600
I don't want to commit 65 to 9 to anything that we've been

09:57.600 --> 10:01.600
discussing how we are going to repeat this with updated material

10:01.600 --> 10:03.600
and new guests in the future.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.600
So those of you that for whatever reason do not want or cannot

10:08.600 --> 10:12.600
take the exam at this point in time, there will be opportunities

10:12.600 --> 10:13.600
in the future.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.600
Although, obviously, this is the genesis cohort of this class.

10:17.600 --> 10:22.600
So I guess receiving the NFT of completion might have a

10:22.600 --> 10:27.600
sentimental value for everyone in the future.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.600
You will be able to find more information on as always on

10:30.600 --> 10:35.600
our Twitter account, the unique metaverse, our Discord channel,

10:35.600 --> 10:36.600
join unique.

10:36.600 --> 10:41.600
We will be announcing the date and all details about the exam

10:41.600 --> 10:42.600
there.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.600
Some more technical information about how the exam will take

10:47.600 --> 10:48.600
place.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.600
You don't really need to know this, but just to give you a

10:52.600 --> 10:56.600
glimpse of what's happening under the hood as we are preparing

10:56.600 --> 10:57.600
for the exam.

10:57.600 --> 11:02.600
As I've said, we want to make the exam fully on saying so you

11:02.600 --> 11:07.600
will be able to access the exam through your browser.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.600
The exam itself, so the exam paper will be minted as an NFT

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
token that will be encrypted.

11:14.600 --> 11:19.600
So unless you have the course access token, you will be able

11:19.600 --> 11:26.600
to see this NFT, you will be able to check its meta data, but

11:26.600 --> 11:31.600
you will not be able to access the actual content of the exam.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.600
Obviously, you will need to connect your meta mask or other

11:36.600 --> 11:39.600
Ethereum compatible wallet that contains the course access

11:39.600 --> 11:43.600
token, as I've said, to be able to access the exam.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.600
Once you do so, once you access the exam, your browser will be

11:47.600 --> 11:51.600
revealing the questions, whether this will be 50 or another

11:51.600 --> 11:55.600
number, we still haven't finalized, but the questions will be

11:55.600 --> 11:57.600
revealed to you one by one.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.600
You will be able to answer the question, each question, and

12:00.600 --> 12:01.600
move to the next.

12:01.600 --> 12:05.600
And at the end of the quiz, you will be asked by your wallet

12:05.600 --> 12:10.600
to sign your responses before sending them for validation.

12:10.600 --> 12:15.600
Once this happens, your responses will be recorded on the

12:15.600 --> 12:18.600
Ethereum blockchain, there will be a transaction that's going

12:18.600 --> 12:21.600
to be broadcasted on the network.

12:21.600 --> 12:27.600
We're working on a zero-no-letproof architecture that will

12:27.600 --> 12:32.600
preserve both your personal privacy and the privacy of your

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
answers from everyone.

12:34.600 --> 12:39.600
So no one will be able to see your responses, but you will

12:39.600 --> 12:43.600
be able to validate that you have actually taken the exam

12:43.600 --> 12:45.600
and submitted these responses.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.600
Your final grade will be automatically computed.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.600
Our idea is that we will not grade the exams manually, but we

12:53.600 --> 12:58.600
will have the smart contract of the exam doing the computation

12:58.600 --> 13:03.600
and revealing your final grade to you, along with the

13:03.600 --> 13:07.600
cryptographic proof that verifying the whole process,

13:07.600 --> 13:12.600
and if you have passed, then your personal NFT certificate of

13:12.600 --> 13:16.600
completion will be minted, will be rendered on your screen,

13:16.600 --> 13:21.600
and if you want, you will be able to mint it as an NFT and store

13:21.600 --> 13:25.600
it in your personal wallet for perpetuity.

13:25.600 --> 13:30.600
At this point in time, we haven't decided on details regarding

13:30.600 --> 13:35.600
the look, feel, and characteristics of the completeness

13:35.600 --> 13:37.600
NFT.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.600
So for example, we're still debating whether this should be a

13:41.600 --> 13:44.600
sold-bound token or not, whether you should be able,

13:44.600 --> 13:49.600
obviously you won't be able to sell it, but we understand that

13:49.600 --> 13:56.600
people might want to transfer it to other wallets that they own.

13:56.600 --> 14:02.600
So we will be working on a design that preserves these first

14:02.600 --> 14:05.600
principles.

14:05.600 --> 14:10.600
Needless to say, if any of you have further questions, have ideas

14:10.600 --> 14:15.600
regarding how we should go about doing a fully on-site privacy

14:15.600 --> 14:20.600
preserving exam and how we should be designing the course

14:20.600 --> 14:25.600
completion certificate, please reach out to me via email or on

14:25.600 --> 14:28.600
Twitter or on Discord.

14:28.600 --> 14:33.600
I'll be more than happy to hear your ideas and discuss them with

14:33.600 --> 14:36.600
6.5 to 9.

14:36.600 --> 14:42.600
Now finally, before I give the floor to 6.5 to 9, I told you

14:42.600 --> 14:47.600
that although this is the final course session of the course,

14:47.600 --> 14:51.600
we have at least five very, very important sessions coming up

14:51.600 --> 14:56.600
with guests happening next week and the week after.

14:56.600 --> 15:02.600
So we will have a panel, four panel discussions, one about

15:02.600 --> 15:07.600
the metaverse, one on generative art, one on NFT photography,

15:07.600 --> 15:10.600
and one on crypto-art NFTs.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.600
As you see in this slide, I'm not going to go through the

15:13.600 --> 15:15.600
names.

15:15.600 --> 15:20.600
It's a super impressive list of people participating in this

15:20.600 --> 15:24.600
panel, so I would encourage you to attend all of them if you can

15:24.600 --> 15:27.600
attend the course of the course.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.600
And we will have a final discussion closing this course with

15:32.600 --> 15:39.600
none other than Balaji Srinivasan alongside

15:39.600 --> 15:46.600
Pangci 5 to 9, one of my top favorite thinkers in this space.

15:46.600 --> 15:52.600
The author of the network state, if you have missed his latest

15:52.600 --> 15:56.600
book, I strongly encourage you to read it.

15:56.600 --> 16:00.600
We were talking with Balaji and we're trying to fix a date for

16:00.600 --> 16:05.600
having him live in the course, so we will be announcing this soon.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.600
We should be finishing with all these panels in the first week

16:09.600 --> 16:10.600
of February.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.600
That's why I said second week or later will be the date of

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
exam.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
So that's all from me.

16:18.600 --> 16:23.600
Once again, if you have questions regarding to the course

16:23.600 --> 16:28.600
logistics final exam or course certificate, please hit me up

16:28.600 --> 16:35.600
on Discord, Twitter or via email and monitor these channels as we

16:35.600 --> 16:41.600
will be updating our FAQs regarding this material.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.600
Without further ado, I'm going to give the floor to 6.5 to 9

16:45.600 --> 16:50.600
now to take us through the topic of the day, which is

16:50.600 --> 16:53.600
metaverse 23rd in the vision of the future of work theory.

16:53.600 --> 16:54.600
Thank you.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.600
Thank you, George.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.600
And I know it was just a good point.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.600
All of you might happen earlier than some of you, so you might not

17:03.600 --> 17:07.600
close with Balaji and I was talking to him today.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.600
And so that might happen in the next few days.

17:09.600 --> 17:12.600
Maybe depends on trying to schedule for the last few weeks.

17:12.600 --> 17:18.600
And it's possible we have a couple of other sessions between

17:18.600 --> 17:25.600
the panels and the, um, what's the word I'm looking for?

17:25.600 --> 17:30.600
And the examination, depending on when your team is ready with

17:30.600 --> 17:31.600
the exam.

17:31.600 --> 17:39.600
But I think as a general rule, we still have quite a few great

17:39.600 --> 17:42.600
speakers on panels coming.

17:42.600 --> 17:49.600
So I'm really excited about this and look forward to the last few

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
weeks of the course.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.600
All right.

17:52.600 --> 17:57.600
Today's session is going to be highly conceptual.

17:57.600 --> 18:03.600
There are not, this is not something that has a lot of

18:03.600 --> 18:07.600
detailed material out in the world.

18:07.600 --> 18:12.600
I believe it is a topic that is generally poorly understood,

18:12.600 --> 18:20.600
underthought about, and definitely vastly under worried about,

18:20.600 --> 18:25.600
um, by not just the average person.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
It's not too surprising.

18:27.600 --> 18:32.600
But even by people who should know better, even by policymakers,

18:32.600 --> 18:37.600
even by advocates for democracy, even by advocates for

18:37.600 --> 18:38.600
constitutional rights.

18:38.600 --> 18:46.600
Um, there is a small number of us, biology as George mentioned,

18:46.600 --> 18:53.600
but also folks like John Rob would deeply worried about this.

18:53.600 --> 19:01.600
And like 99.999999% of the world who hasn't thought about the

19:01.600 --> 19:06.600
world, who hasn't thought about this at all, is not worried about

19:06.600 --> 19:07.600
it at all.

19:07.600 --> 19:12.600
And quite frankly, if you talk about it with them, they might think

19:12.600 --> 19:15.600
this is all a bit absurd.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.600
Um, but I'm sure it's not absurd.

19:17.600 --> 19:21.600
And I'll try and give a sense of what I'm worried about, what I

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
think we can do.

19:22.600 --> 19:26.600
And in all cases, actually, it's quite challenging.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.600
So, oh, that slides wrong.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.600
Okay.

19:32.600 --> 19:37.600
Let's start with what is the Internet?

19:37.600 --> 19:43.600
And, you know, for someone who might be joining the Internet now,

19:43.600 --> 19:55.600
in 2020 or 2023 or 2010, as a mature system with large applications,

19:55.600 --> 20:00.600
it might not be exactly obvious what the Internet is or what it was

20:00.600 --> 20:01.600
designed to be.

20:01.600 --> 20:04.600
And what it was designed to be is very simple.

20:04.600 --> 20:10.600
It was designed to be a network of networks.

20:10.600 --> 20:15.600
The way to imagine it is to think that there was a time where people

20:15.600 --> 20:22.600
had a variety of their own networks within an office, within a

20:22.600 --> 20:26.600
government, within an academic institution.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.600
And those networks did not necessarily interoperate with each other,

20:30.600 --> 20:33.600
did not necessarily communicate with each other.

20:33.600 --> 20:42.600
And the idea behind the Internet wasn't to build the one top

20:42.600 --> 20:47.600
down network that everyone has to use.

20:47.600 --> 20:55.600
The idea was to allow people to make their networks interoperate

20:55.600 --> 20:56.600
with each other.

20:56.600 --> 21:01.600
A network of networks.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.600
Not a network.

21:03.600 --> 21:10.600
And if you go back to 1972, famously, the Internet was in some

21:10.600 --> 21:12.600
ways invented a DARPA.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.600
The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency of the United

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
States government.

21:18.600 --> 21:24.600
And as the theory went back then, it was designed to create a

21:24.600 --> 21:29.600
communication network that would be resilient to a nuclear attack

21:29.600 --> 21:33.600
because it would be decentralized, because it would be one point

21:33.600 --> 21:35.600
of failure.

21:35.600 --> 21:42.600
And the original four concepts behind the Internet were these

21:42.600 --> 21:46.600
following, and it goes to the theory of a network of networks.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.600
So it was actually, we should actually read them, they're

21:48.600 --> 21:51.600
interesting.

21:51.600 --> 21:55.600
But each network had to stand on its own, and no internal changes

21:55.600 --> 21:58.600
could be required of each network before being connected to

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
Internet.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.600
So this makes sense if you communicate among your devices

22:04.600 --> 22:11.600
within your own network, in your house or business.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.600
You don't have to change how you do that so long as you then

22:15.600 --> 22:19.600
communicate in the standard-based way once you connect to the

22:19.600 --> 22:20.600
Internet.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.600
Now in practice, most internal networks now are also

22:23.600 --> 22:26.600
communicating in a similar way as the Internet.

22:26.600 --> 22:32.600
But that was not and is not a design protocol.

22:32.600 --> 22:37.600
Second, communication is a best efforts exercise.

22:37.600 --> 22:41.600
So you try and move the packets forward.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.600
If it doesn't work, you retranslate, you try again.

22:44.600 --> 22:49.600
It gives redundancy resilience.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.600
Quote unquote black boxes, and it's funny because our black

22:52.600 --> 22:57.600
boxes have been, it's entered the vernacular for a whole

22:57.600 --> 23:02.600
variety of usages.

23:02.600 --> 23:07.600
But what we mean really are the routers in the gateways.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.600
Connect the networks and they don't.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.600
They're not content aware.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.600
They're a black box.

23:15.600 --> 23:16.600
They just move.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.600
They just move the data further down.

23:20.600 --> 23:25.600
And for our purposes, the last one is the most important,

23:25.600 --> 23:31.600
which is no global control at the operations level.

23:31.600 --> 23:40.600
There's no one place that is in charge of the Internet.

23:40.600 --> 23:45.600
There's no CEO of the Internet.

23:45.600 --> 23:49.600
There's no Internet incorporated.

23:49.600 --> 23:58.600
There's not one person or function or organization whose

23:58.600 --> 24:05.600
permission you need to ask to use the Internet.

24:05.600 --> 24:06.600
Why?

24:06.600 --> 24:09.600
Because the Internet is not a thing in and of itself.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.600
It's a way for people's individual networks to communicate

24:12.600 --> 24:15.600
with each other.

24:15.600 --> 24:20.600
It is perfectly possible that say the University of

24:20.600 --> 24:24.600
Macansea says, if you want to be on my internal network,

24:24.600 --> 24:28.600
you have to get the permission of the IT network.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.600
Makes sense.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.600
That's their network.

24:32.600 --> 24:39.600
But there's nobody whose permission you have to ask to

24:39.600 --> 24:44.600
start transmitting packets across the Internet.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.600
And this has two implications.

24:46.600 --> 24:51.600
The first implication is that everything we're going to

24:51.600 --> 24:56.600
talk about relating to decentralization is not some type

24:56.600 --> 25:05.600
of radical anarchist thing that nobody has ever done before.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.600
This is quite literally how the Internet works.

25:09.600 --> 25:14.600
And I'm pretty sure everyone agrees that the Internet has

25:14.600 --> 25:18.600
been an immense boon to global society.

25:18.600 --> 25:22.600
And the fact that we can communicate globally with each

25:22.600 --> 25:26.600
other in all types of ways is a huge plus for humanity.

25:26.600 --> 25:33.600
And then the second part is a huge reason the Internet has

25:33.600 --> 25:39.600
become, what the Internet has become, is because you do not

25:39.600 --> 25:45.600
need someone's permission to connect a server to the Internet

25:45.600 --> 25:49.600
and start serving data.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.600
If this was, and I know it might be hard for people to

25:53.600 --> 26:03.600
conceptualize, but there was a time where before the app stores,

26:03.600 --> 26:05.600
it's funny because the app stores are also permissioned,

26:05.600 --> 26:08.600
but it's even easier to think about this one, where the phone

26:08.600 --> 26:14.600
carriers decided what applications would run your phones.

26:14.600 --> 26:20.600
And so if you wanted to have, you made a new application,

26:20.600 --> 26:25.600
let's say you made WhatsApp.

26:25.600 --> 26:38.600
You have to go to AT&T and say, I would like to convince you

26:38.600 --> 26:47.600
to allow me to use WhatsApp to install WhatsApp on the

26:47.600 --> 26:49.600
devices of the network.

26:49.600 --> 26:53.600
In AT&T, I'm going to say, oh, what does WhatsApp do?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.600
Oh, it's free text messages, basically.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.600
Except it's better.

26:58.600 --> 27:00.600
It's better than text messages.

27:00.600 --> 27:04.600
You can do pictures, videos.

27:04.600 --> 27:10.600
But this is going to compete with my text messaging services.

27:10.600 --> 27:11.600
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.600
It's better than that.

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
People are going to like it more.

27:14.600 --> 27:20.600
And AT&T is going to say, well, you want me to sign off and

27:20.600 --> 27:28.600
give you access to all of my brand and customers and

27:28.600 --> 27:31.600
installed base so you can compete with me.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.600
You're saying, oh, that sounds good, right?

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
I'm going to jump in the lake.

27:35.600 --> 27:39.600
Of course, I'm not going to let you run in my network.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.600
Or let's say you're going to take the other end of the

27:42.600 --> 27:43.600
spectrum.

27:43.600 --> 27:46.600
You say, here's my application.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.600
Oh, what does your application do?

27:48.600 --> 27:52.600
And if you press the button in your application,

27:52.600 --> 27:56.600
it makes farting sounds.

27:56.600 --> 27:59.600
Excuse me, what do you mean it makes farting sounds?

27:59.600 --> 28:03.600
I mean, the phone will make a farting sound.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.600
You're now AT&T.

28:06.600 --> 28:10.600
Ma Bell, the glory of the American telecommunications

28:10.600 --> 28:12.600
industry.

28:12.600 --> 28:21.600
You say, you expect me, under the AT&T brand, to make available

28:21.600 --> 28:25.600
to my customers.

28:25.600 --> 28:29.600
The parents of America, the mothers and fathers of America,

28:29.600 --> 28:35.600
you want me to make available a farting up?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.600
I'll get fired.

28:37.600 --> 28:40.600
The board of directors will, someone will show a board

28:40.600 --> 28:43.600
and there will be shocked, horrified, and they'll fire me.

28:43.600 --> 28:48.600
Of course, you can't have a farting up.

28:48.600 --> 28:54.600
And you might say, oh, I don't know, the farting up

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
existence.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.600
Maybe it should, maybe it shouldn't.

28:57.600 --> 29:02.600
But the important point is, once you build these choke points

29:02.600 --> 29:12.600
in, they will be used for the purposes of the organization.

29:12.600 --> 29:16.600
They will be used for the purposes and business objectives

29:16.600 --> 29:19.600
of the organization, whether they are very serious business

29:19.600 --> 29:20.600
objectives.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.600
They don't want someone to compete with their text message

29:24.600 --> 29:26.600
insurance.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.600
Or maybe their indirect business objectives.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.600
A brand manager of AT&T or the CEO of AT&T thinks the AT&T

29:33.600 --> 29:37.600
brand stands for something and that something doesn't include

29:37.600 --> 29:41.600
farts.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.600
The Internet is not like that.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.600
You can connect to the Internet.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.600
Make a website.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.600
Press a button on the website and your website can make

29:54.600 --> 29:56.600
farting sounds.

29:56.600 --> 30:01.600
No one can tell you, oh, this is very brand inappropriate for

30:01.600 --> 30:02.600
the Internet.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.600
We can't allow this.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.600
You're going to have to take this down because it's just a

30:06.600 --> 30:07.600
communication protocol.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.600
It's a way to connect the network.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.600
It's a network of networks.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.600
It's a way for networks to talk to each other.

30:13.600 --> 30:20.600
And the fact that we can do silly things, important things,

30:20.600 --> 30:25.600
things that seem silly but then turn out to be important,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.600
Twitter to me is the definitive example.

30:28.600 --> 30:32.600
Everyone thought Twitter was absurd at first.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
Not that important.

30:34.600 --> 30:40.600
And now it's a major communication platform for presidents

30:40.600 --> 30:43.600
and prime ministers.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.600
But this was also true of Facebook.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.600
You can read things from Facebook first started.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.600
Oh, what a terrible idea.

30:52.600 --> 31:00.600
It's a platform for college kids who have no money and have

31:00.600 --> 31:04.600
nothing better to do to chat with each other.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
This doesn't sound very serious.

31:06.600 --> 31:11.600
This was the public process at the beginning of Facebook.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.600
Why would this be worth anything?

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
Why does this matter?

31:14.600 --> 31:20.600
And so societies are better when they allow you to

31:20.600 --> 31:27.600
permissionly innovate because there will be many bad ideas.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.600
Like Facebook and Twitter, you know, Facebook and Twitter

31:31.600 --> 31:33.600
have survivorship bias.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.600
There were many, many ideas tried on the Internet, most of

31:37.600 --> 31:41.600
which tried and failed.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
But the ones that succeeded changed the world.

31:45.600 --> 31:49.600
And those typically don't come from some central planning type

31:49.600 --> 31:52.600
function they come from.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.600
The marketplace of ideas.

31:54.600 --> 31:59.600
So one, I just made a utility based case for society society

31:59.600 --> 32:02.600
who have better products and services if you let people

32:02.600 --> 32:06.740
go to their own

32:06.740 --> 32:10.740
business.

32:10.740 --> 32:16.740
But there's also a human dignity, human expression, human freedom case.

32:16.740 --> 32:22.740
A world where you're allowed to make a farting application,

32:22.740 --> 32:26.740
a specific one, picking that type of example.

32:26.740 --> 32:31.740
Obviously I picked an example that says a world where you're allowed to make a website to teach

32:31.740 --> 32:35.740
mathematics.

32:35.740 --> 32:39.740
Of course our centralized services are going to allow you to make websites to teach mathematics.

32:39.740 --> 32:43.740
How free a society is, how many rights and how much

32:43.740 --> 32:51.740
do you have as a citizen of a society, is when you're allowed to do things that

32:51.740 --> 32:55.740
poke front of the people in the know.

32:55.740 --> 32:59.740
Or maybe not as desirable by the people in the know.

32:59.740 --> 33:03.740
Our view is possibly not having dignity.

33:03.740 --> 33:07.740
This is how a free society operates.

33:07.740 --> 33:13.740
So the internet, by its design, was a form of free society.

33:13.740 --> 33:19.740
Now that design was designed that way for resiliency.

33:19.740 --> 33:23.740
More so than, I think, permissionless innovation.

33:23.740 --> 33:31.740
But those design choices that built that resiliency were also the same design choices as gave us permissionless innovation.

33:31.740 --> 33:35.740
And they gave us the internet we have today.

33:35.740 --> 33:39.740
It's very, very important.

33:39.740 --> 33:43.740
And everything, this is the basis for everything else we're going to talk about.

33:43.740 --> 33:47.740
It's not as if none of these things have been done before.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.740
They've been done.

33:51.740 --> 33:55.740
And so, the internet is used on every day.

33:55.740 --> 33:59.740
It's called the internet.

33:59.740 --> 34:01.740
And it works great.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.740
Now, this is like the good news.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.740
What's the bad news?

34:06.740 --> 34:11.740
Well, the internet, I basically every level is centralized.

34:11.740 --> 34:19.740
And this comes from

34:19.740 --> 34:27.740
the internet, where the internet is, where the internet is, where the internet is, where the internet is, where the internet is.

34:27.740 --> 34:33.740
From bottom up, you start with internet service providers.

34:33.740 --> 34:43.740
Most countries, or most locations in most countries, have a monopoly, a duopoly, or an oligopoly of service providers.

34:43.740 --> 34:55.740
Since they're the ones who are transmitting the packets for most people, they're a two-point.

34:55.740 --> 35:00.740
If it's hard to imagine what the alternative is, I call you, but I got to get into it from somewhere, right?

35:00.740 --> 35:07.740
I'm going to get Comcast, or AT&T, or what have you, right?

35:07.740 --> 35:09.740
How could it work a different way?

35:09.740 --> 35:13.740
Well, a different way, and this is not mature yet, but a different way would be what's called,

35:13.740 --> 35:22.740
MASH Network, where even the physical communication is going peer to peer from device to device,

35:22.740 --> 35:29.740
that there is not one single point that says,

35:29.740 --> 35:36.740
this data can come to this point, and this data cannot.

35:36.740 --> 35:43.740
We don't feel this so much in the West, but ISPs are a problem.

35:43.740 --> 35:55.740
When Egypt was having its one of the various social movements, and people were coordinating through the internet,

35:55.740 --> 36:05.740
and Egypt has, I believe, and I can't say I'm an expert on Egyptian ISPs, but what I remember just reading the news there,

36:05.740 --> 36:11.740
the government at some point just shut down the internet for the whole country.

36:11.740 --> 36:16.740
It's just called Egypt Telecom, or whatever it's called, and I'm like, it just shut it down.

36:16.740 --> 36:19.740
No, this is a bad productivity, right?

36:19.740 --> 36:26.740
Sure, sure. It's right about the productivity, but on the other hand, we want the social movement to stop,

36:26.740 --> 36:32.740
so just turn off the internet, and because you had one service provider, you could turn off.

36:32.740 --> 36:36.740
It's one level, second level.

36:36.740 --> 36:42.740
Cloud hosting.

36:42.740 --> 36:44.740
Cloud hosting is fantastic, right?

36:44.740 --> 36:47.740
Our exam is on the web services for all types of things.

36:47.740 --> 36:50.740
It's convenient.

36:50.740 --> 36:56.740
It's fast, it's high-performance, it has all types of features, it's less work.

36:56.740 --> 36:59.740
That is a point of centralization.

36:59.740 --> 37:04.740
You see this sometimes when Amazon has data centers in different regions,

37:04.740 --> 37:09.740
and their big region is USA East, it's located in Northern Virginia,

37:09.740 --> 37:14.740
and if that region goes down, many of your favorite websites go down,

37:14.740 --> 37:17.740
because they're all hosted there.

37:17.740 --> 37:21.740
Content delivery networks, CDNs, what do CDNs do?

37:21.740 --> 37:28.740
They store files close to the end-user, so they download quickly,

37:28.740 --> 37:31.740
so they use your experiences better.

37:31.740 --> 37:34.740
There's a handful of them.

37:34.740 --> 37:40.740
They also, in some cases, protect against what are known as DDOS,

37:40.740 --> 37:44.740
as distributed denial of service attacks.

37:44.740 --> 37:54.740
Again, these are very useful services that make the internet better,

37:54.740 --> 38:02.740
but they are points of control, because all of these are companies, right?

38:02.740 --> 38:09.740
Anything that is a company ultimately has a human in charge,

38:09.740 --> 38:15.740
and that human can ultimately decide to take an action for their own reasons

38:15.740 --> 38:19.740
or be compelled to buy a government.

38:19.740 --> 38:25.740
And the only honest answer is that when compelled to a company will follow

38:25.740 --> 38:29.740
what a government asks them to do, if they don't have a choice.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.740
These are kind of the architectural level.

38:32.740 --> 38:36.740
Let's go step up to applications.

38:36.740 --> 38:44.740
Discovery was now known as Search, but used to be Discovery.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.740
It's highly centralized.

38:46.740 --> 38:55.740
In most countries, Google has a very high market share.

38:55.740 --> 38:57.740
Is that good? Is that bad?

38:57.740 --> 39:00.740
I don't know. Google's useful. I use it.

39:00.740 --> 39:09.740
The price of Google, the penalty of Google, is the things you don't see.

39:09.740 --> 39:13.740
If Google has a certain algorithm, and for whatever reason,

39:13.740 --> 39:19.740
the algorithm doesn't like a certain website, topic, etc.

39:19.740 --> 39:23.740
It won't appear. Or it won't appear on the first page,

39:23.740 --> 39:26.740
or it won't appear in the first few pages.

39:26.740 --> 39:29.740
Right, frankly, if it doesn't appear in the first page,

39:29.740 --> 39:31.740
it's mostly like it doesn't exist.

39:31.740 --> 39:35.740
If it doesn't appear in the first few pages of Google Search results,

39:35.740 --> 39:38.740
it definitely doesn't exist.

39:38.740 --> 39:42.740
So you could be there, you could be on the internet.

39:42.740 --> 39:51.740
But if an algorithm you have nothing to do with decides it doesn't like your website,

39:51.740 --> 39:54.740
it effectively does not exist for most people.

39:54.740 --> 39:59.740
Now, there's good reasons why the algorithm does these types of things.

39:59.740 --> 40:02.740
People try to spam Google search engine optimization,

40:02.740 --> 40:07.740
and it's a cat and mouse game with the search engines.

40:07.740 --> 40:13.740
But as you've gotten to centralized large market share providers,

40:13.740 --> 40:16.740
you get algorithmic risk.

40:16.740 --> 40:24.740
Like one, if you had, if search happened through 200 different algorithms,

40:24.740 --> 40:29.740
each with 0.5% market share.

40:29.740 --> 40:34.740
It wouldn't matter if one of them didn't like your website.

40:34.740 --> 40:37.740
It was probably a good reason.

40:37.740 --> 40:39.740
I don't know what's said about that.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.740
Interesting to people, right?

40:41.740 --> 40:45.740
And it's correct that you're, but when there's one,

40:45.740 --> 40:56.740
first diversified, it's more likely something will go wrong for non-substantive reasons.

40:56.740 --> 41:02.740
Communication platforms, communication platforms have huge network defects.

41:02.740 --> 41:07.740
You want to go on Twitter because everyone else is on Twitter.

41:07.740 --> 41:10.740
You don't go on Twitter because it has 140 characters,

41:10.740 --> 41:13.740
280 characters or what have you.

41:13.740 --> 41:15.740
That's truly replicable.

41:15.740 --> 41:19.740
What's not replicable is that everyone else is on Twitter.

41:19.740 --> 41:27.740
And so, you know, Facebook is like the network for short form communication,

41:27.740 --> 41:33.740
medium form communication, LinkedIn for job seeking professional communication,

41:33.740 --> 41:37.740
Twitter for short form communication.

41:37.740 --> 41:43.740
All of them with very high market shares, all of them fairly centralized.

41:43.740 --> 41:49.740
And unlike the Internet,

41:49.740 --> 41:54.740
you need Twitter's permission to be on Twitter.

41:54.740 --> 42:01.740
All of this endless, endless, endless arguing

42:01.740 --> 42:06.740
about which accounts should be banned, which accounts should be boosted,

42:06.740 --> 42:11.740
which accounts should appear in the search results on Twitter,

42:11.740 --> 42:14.740
is a failure of architecture.

42:14.740 --> 42:18.740
We don't have this discussion about websites.

42:18.740 --> 42:23.740
We don't have it about email because those are not centralized

42:23.740 --> 42:27.740
in the same way.

42:27.740 --> 42:35.740
Whereas on Twitter, whether you have an account or not depends on who the C.L. is.

42:35.740 --> 42:41.740
And it doesn't matter who.

42:41.740 --> 42:48.740
You think is right.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.740
Maybe Parab was making the right decisions.

42:50.740 --> 42:54.740
Maybe Elon's making the right decisions.

42:54.740 --> 43:01.740
And the fact that there's a specific person whose views on content moderation

43:01.740 --> 43:06.740
you have to take into account is already the failure.

43:06.740 --> 43:11.740
It's irrelevant to me if Elon is more or less right than Parab.

43:11.740 --> 43:14.740
Totally irrelevant.

43:14.740 --> 43:15.740
There's no CEO of email.

43:15.740 --> 43:17.740
There's no CEO of the Internet.

43:17.740 --> 43:21.740
But there is a CEO of our short messaging protocol.

43:21.740 --> 43:27.740
And that is a form of failure case.

43:27.740 --> 43:29.740
E-commerce is similar.

43:29.740 --> 43:35.740
Amazon has reasonable market share in E-commerce, eBay, and its sector.

43:35.740 --> 43:40.740
Network effects are not quite as strong as it's not as bad.

43:40.740 --> 43:48.740
Payments is tragic.

43:48.740 --> 43:52.740
Payments still effectively run through the fiat system.

43:52.740 --> 43:58.740
And they effectively run through a couple of payment processors.

43:58.740 --> 44:04.740
Internet native payments are crypto currencies.

44:04.740 --> 44:10.740
And they're there and they exist.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.740
And they're very, very important.

44:12.740 --> 44:24.740
And they're under constant some form of attack by the non-crypto ecosystem.

44:24.740 --> 44:31.740
And this is not to say that things don't go wrong in crypto, but there has yet to be.

44:31.740 --> 44:39.740
I think a major stakeholder in the non-crypto world to come out and say,

44:39.740 --> 44:47.740
a government of an important country to say, well, this is important for decentralization purposes.

44:47.740 --> 44:52.740
In fact, most of the governments think this is a downside of crypto.

44:52.740 --> 44:58.740
They would like to keep payments under their control.

44:58.740 --> 45:04.740
So you look at this in aggregate and we're kind of coasting.

45:04.740 --> 45:08.740
Things have been getting worse.

45:08.740 --> 45:18.740
The Internet of Today is substantially more centralized than the Internet of 1990 was.

45:18.740 --> 45:20.740
But it's gradual.

45:20.740 --> 45:24.740
It's one step at a time.

45:24.740 --> 45:28.740
Along the way, it gets more convenient.

45:28.740 --> 45:30.740
Along the way, it gets easier to use.

45:30.740 --> 45:32.740
Things load faster.

45:32.740 --> 45:36.740
You have more features and functionality, etc, etc.

45:36.740 --> 45:44.740
So nobody rebels because it's day to day on day to day activity is getting better,

45:44.740 --> 45:50.740
while on for existential reasons getting worse.

45:50.740 --> 46:00.740
I found an interesting draft paper from the IETF in their network working group on centralization

46:00.740 --> 46:03.740
and Internet standards.

46:03.740 --> 46:06.740
Actually, it's a draft paper.

46:06.740 --> 46:10.740
It's not official.

46:10.740 --> 46:18.740
But I liked a couple of things that wrote so much that I just copy-pasted them right into here.

46:18.740 --> 46:20.740
And I'm going to read them.

46:20.740 --> 46:26.740
So the Internet's very nature is incompatible with the centralization of its functions.

46:26.740 --> 46:31.740
As a large heterogeneous collection of interconnected systems,

46:31.740 --> 46:35.740
the Internet is often characterized as a network of networks.

46:35.740 --> 46:45.740
These network related peers who agree to facilitate communication rather than having a relationship of subservience

46:45.740 --> 46:48.740
to others' requirements and coarsionally.

46:48.740 --> 46:54.740
This focus on independence of action carries through the way the network is architect,

46:54.740 --> 46:57.740
for example, in the concept of an autonomous system.

46:57.740 --> 47:05.740
Second, the Internet's first duty is to the end user.

47:05.740 --> 47:10.740
Allowing such power to be concentrated into few hands is counter to the IETF submission

47:10.740 --> 47:15.740
of creating an Internet that will help us build a better human society.

47:15.740 --> 47:19.740
When a third party has unavoidable access to communications,

47:19.740 --> 47:22.740
we quote informational and positional advantages,

47:22.740 --> 47:27.740
gain can be used to observe behavior of an optical effect,

47:27.740 --> 47:31.740
and shape or even deny behavior, the choke point effect,

47:31.740 --> 47:37.740
which can be used by those parties or the states that have authority over them for coercive ends.

47:37.740 --> 47:40.740
I have nothing to add to this.

47:40.740 --> 47:45.740
This is, I couldn't agree with this one.

47:45.740 --> 47:57.740
And then the paper goes on and lists five negative parts of the negative aspects of the concentration of power,

47:57.740 --> 48:00.740
limiting innovation, which we discussed.

48:00.740 --> 48:09.740
Constraining competition, which is similar, the first and the second, often go together.

48:09.740 --> 48:15.740
Reducing availability means that you're not building resilience and redundancy,

48:15.740 --> 48:18.740
and this could be because of unintended effects.

48:18.740 --> 48:23.740
So if you have one ISP and something happens in their facility,

48:23.740 --> 48:27.740
and the whole Internet for your country goes down inadvertently,

48:27.740 --> 48:32.740
that is a reduction of availability accidentally.

48:32.740 --> 48:37.740
But sometimes you have a reduction of availability,

48:37.740 --> 48:44.740
reduction of availability,

48:46.740 --> 48:49.740
intentional, the Egypt Telecom example,

48:49.740 --> 48:52.740
was an intentional reduction of availability.

48:52.740 --> 48:56.740
Creating monoculture,

48:56.740 --> 49:02.740
this is a limiting innovation point, but at the intellectual level.

49:02.740 --> 49:09.740
So this is, if there's a certain set of values or principles that are acceptable to Facebook,

49:09.740 --> 49:15.740
but not to others, and Facebook gets a dominant position on the Internet,

49:15.740 --> 49:22.740
then we all have to go along with those sets of values, principles, forms of speech, what have you.

49:22.740 --> 49:33.740
So the world is a huge diverse heterogeneous place.

49:33.740 --> 49:41.740
We are not all alike at the individual interest group,

49:41.740 --> 49:45.740
regional, national level.

49:45.740 --> 49:48.740
We should not all be alike.

49:48.740 --> 49:58.740
We should not all have to be in a certain way.

49:58.740 --> 50:03.740
But if we then have to run through a specific corporation,

50:03.740 --> 50:07.740
that corporation may, for a variety of reasons,

50:07.740 --> 50:15.740
on purpose or accidentally, voluntarily or coerced by others,

50:15.740 --> 50:25.740
to flatten out squash that human diversity to fit it into a specific standard acceptable black corporation.

50:25.740 --> 50:32.740
And it's very, very hard to say, I'm going to have a corporation

50:32.740 --> 50:39.740
that fully allows all of these differences to exist.

50:39.740 --> 50:52.740
For one, some of the differences are long-standing national disputes among nation states where

50:52.740 --> 50:56.740
certain countries will say, well, you have to say this,

50:56.740 --> 51:01.740
and you're not allowed to say that, and their neighbor will say the opposite.

51:01.740 --> 51:10.740
And since no company is in a position, social media company is not in a position to solve all world conflicts,

51:10.740 --> 51:13.740
they have to take a position on the topic.

51:13.740 --> 51:16.740
And sometimes they're taking three different positions, right?

51:16.740 --> 51:20.740
Their position in country X and their position in country Y

51:20.740 --> 51:23.740
and their position in third countries, and all of them might be different,

51:23.740 --> 51:25.740
and they're trying to balance all these things.

51:25.740 --> 51:30.740
And the only reason they have to try and balance all these things is their is centralized support.

51:30.740 --> 51:36.740
And then the last one is self-reinforcement.

51:36.740 --> 51:40.740
And this is the advantages.

51:40.740 --> 51:52.740
These are the advantages that a certain service has by being in a dominant position.

51:52.740 --> 51:54.740
You see this in search.

51:54.740 --> 52:00.740
If you see all of people search queries and then what they then click on,

52:00.740 --> 52:05.740
you're in a better position to build a better search engine than someone who doesn't.

52:05.740 --> 52:09.740
This is considered a big risk in artificial intelligence or machine learning,

52:09.740 --> 52:11.740
the use of technical term.

52:11.740 --> 52:13.740
But the more data you have, the better your model is.

52:13.740 --> 52:16.740
If your model is better, more people are going to want to use it.

52:16.740 --> 52:19.740
If more people use it, they'll give you more data.

52:19.740 --> 52:27.740
And it spirals.

52:27.740 --> 52:33.740
So these are each of these pretty bad.

52:33.740 --> 52:39.740
And I don't even think these are the bad things.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.740
My greatest worry is democracy itself.

52:42.740 --> 52:46.740
And again, I'm going to sound strange.

52:46.740 --> 52:48.740
I grant you.

52:48.740 --> 52:52.740
I grant you, I'm in a deep minority position here.

52:52.740 --> 52:59.740
I grant you that most people, and I think, remember who I discussed this one.

52:59.740 --> 53:01.740
I think Kristiksi.

53:01.740 --> 53:10.740
This is like an interesting divide in the world is between people for who the digital world is real

53:10.740 --> 53:15.740
and people for whom it's not.

53:15.740 --> 53:27.740
A lot of people, if I had this discussion with them, might say, well, I mean, what difference does it make what happens on Facebook?

53:27.740 --> 53:30.740
That's not real life, in fact, I could just close my Facebook account.

53:30.740 --> 53:38.740
My real life was my car, my house, my physical goods.

53:38.740 --> 53:49.740
And I deeply disagree with that both today and in the future because I don't know about you,

53:49.740 --> 53:57.740
but I spent the vast majority of my working hours looking at a computer screen.

53:57.740 --> 54:01.740
Your phone also being, you know, a fairly powerful computer.

54:01.740 --> 54:14.740
So between my phone screen and my laptop screen and my desktop screen, I spent the large majority of my waking hours looking at this.

54:14.740 --> 54:28.740
And then sometimes all rare occasions take a break and I don't know, watch a movie on Netflix on my TV, which is also a computer.

54:28.740 --> 54:32.740
Any modern TV is also a computer as well.

54:32.740 --> 54:44.740
That is operating through those same internet service providers who are in content delivery networks and centralized firms who are delivering your whatever you're seeing in your computer screen.

54:44.740 --> 54:54.740
And so my view is I already spent the majority of my life in the digital world and quite frankly the important things in my life.

54:54.740 --> 55:22.740
All of the things that I can afford in the physical world are downstream from my professional activities, which are all intermediate by the digital world.

55:22.740 --> 55:27.740
And I don't know if this has happened to you recently. It happened to me once a few years ago.

55:27.740 --> 55:35.740
Pre-COVID when I was in an office, or even after the office, and the internet went out.

55:35.740 --> 55:48.740
And then we called our internet provider and the internet provider said, yeah, it's going to be out all day.

55:48.740 --> 55:59.740
We spent a few minutes in New York. We spent a few minutes thinking about what to do.

55:59.740 --> 56:07.740
And we realized there was basically nothing we could do.

56:07.740 --> 56:18.740
It was basically we were worthless in the office letter, totally and completely worthless.

56:18.740 --> 56:19.740
It was shocking.

56:19.740 --> 56:36.740
And it was shocking to think about that, you know, about 25 years ago, something in that range, most offices did not have internet.

56:36.740 --> 56:46.740
And so people would go to work and do whatever they were doing and whatever they were doing did not include the internet.

56:46.740 --> 56:50.740
You know, 30 years ago, effectively done it.

56:50.740 --> 56:54.740
And you were thinking about this.

56:54.740 --> 56:59.740
What actually can you do in an office without an internet?

56:59.740 --> 57:07.740
You couldn't send an email. It couldn't browse the web.

57:07.740 --> 57:21.740
Theoretically, you could make some calls, but our CRM was online, our customer relationship management system was online.

57:21.740 --> 57:30.740
So you couldn't record the calls or in fact find the people we were supposed to call because that was also online.

57:30.740 --> 57:35.740
We were literally worthless with other.

57:35.740 --> 57:47.740
So we picked up and went home and this was pre-COVID times, pre-remo work times, but we went and figured, well, whatever the downside is from working from home,

57:47.740 --> 57:51.740
it's a thousand times better than being here with that together with other.

57:51.740 --> 57:55.740
And I've went a few days and it was bracing.

57:55.740 --> 57:58.740
It was shocking.

57:58.740 --> 58:02.740
And they think basically everything is that way now.

58:02.740 --> 58:11.740
The large majority of people are dependent in some capacity on the internet to do anything.

58:11.740 --> 58:22.740
In which case we're in the living digital world and how we interact in a digital world and what is our governance and our architecture in the digital world.

58:22.740 --> 58:25.740
Super important.

58:25.740 --> 58:33.740
And it's super important that we preserve the same models of governance that we have in the physical world in the world.

58:33.740 --> 58:44.740
Or come to that and say, there.

58:44.740 --> 58:51.740
Then introduce a concept that I have stolen from John Rob.

58:51.740 --> 59:11.740
John Rob is a systems slash networks thinker he came out of the military sphere and thinks about networks, tribes and oodle loops and all of these types of things.

59:11.740 --> 59:21.740
But he is concerned about the concept of the long night.

59:21.740 --> 59:26.740
And these are a couple of the streets in order and it's going to read them.

59:26.740 --> 59:34.740
There's disruption, although potentially painful in the short term doesn't last more as a crude a damaging over the long term.

59:34.740 --> 59:40.740
In fact, the true danger posed by an internet work world is opposite of the structure.

59:40.740 --> 59:44.740
The danger is an all encompassing online.

59:44.740 --> 59:53.740
Or thought, as same as a thought and approach reinforced reinforced by hundreds of millions of socially internet work corporations.

59:53.740 --> 59:56.740
A global or thought exceed the ruthless.

59:56.740 --> 01:00:02.740
The narrows public thought down to a single baron ideological framework.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:05.740
A ruling network that prevents dissent.

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:15.740
And locks us into stagnation and an inevitable failure as it runs a foul of reality and human nature is ruling network already exists.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.740
This concern, which is not dissimilar for mine.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:22.740
It's framed differently, but it's not dissimilar.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:38.740
Is that as we network more and more across centralized services.

01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:53.740
It becomes much easier to enforce a certain way of thinking.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:59.740
A certain way of prescribed and allowed thought.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:09.740
And what I think we know historically.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:13.740
That allow freedom of speech that allow freedom of action.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:30.740
That are more human centric, less.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:35.740
Out perform in every way.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:45.740
Quality of life for their citizens.

01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:52.740
And they outperform in human freedom and dignity.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:02:11.740
And I think that if you assume a way that intentions which you should not make people in power.

01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:20.940
prefer to stay in power. But even if you assume away bad intentions and assume that the people

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:29.340
at the top selflessly want to manage the economy, the country, the society for its benefit,

01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:38.460
it is simply impossible for a small group of people at the top of any complex society to make

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:43.580
all the right decisions on every single topic for everyone across the country. It is impossible.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:51.900
It is why as humans went from smaller societies to larger societies

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:57.020
and simpler societies to more complex advanced societies,

01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:07.820
we have decentralized power to let people operate. To let people look around in their

01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:12.380
take the simplest example. You are in Washington, D.C.

01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:24.460
Would it be logical for you to know if in Santa Fe, New Mexico someone should open an organic grocery

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:31.420
store. If you look at Soviet era's central planning five years plan, they were trying to do this

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.820
across all 11 time zones of the Soviet Union. Turned out, you can't do it effectively,

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:43.420
it doesn't mean you're not smart, it just means there's too much information for a small group

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:50.460
of people to talk to process. You need to let information process across everyone's brains.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:58.780
And ultimately, some combination of the people in Santa Fe seeing what's happening in Santa Fe

01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:04.140
and some price signals from organic food expensive or inexpensive available or not available

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:12.300
will naturally, it's a somewhat opening or not opening an organic food shop. And it's like this

01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:21.500
for everyone. Systems that are centralized information processing systems break down under a certain

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:31.260
level of complexity. And so when he means a single baron ideological framework that runs a foul

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:37.660
of reality in human nature, I believe, I'm going to try and get him on the course in the spring.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:49.820
I believe to catch that charge, I might have committed for the spring. I believe, this is what he means,

01:04:49.820 --> 01:05:00.780
that if you lose diversity of thought, including people who are quote unquote wrong,

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:08.460
you end up with a less successful society, a successful society lets people disagree,

01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:14.380
a successful society lets people think wrong things because sometimes it turns out, you know,

01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:18.700
most times when people are thinking wrong things, they're actually wrong. But

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:25.900
sometimes when people are thinking wrong things, they're actually very, very, very right and they

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:33.420
help society move forward. And a mature confident society allows this.

01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:44.300
And a top down driven monarchy of the whatever century doesn't.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:46.780
And so,

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:56.220
hold this thought as we're looking next couple slides.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:07.660
My concern is that we're about to invent a tremendous amount of awesome technology.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:16.220
Awesome. That is the correct word. I'm not embarrassed to say it. I think over the next five,

01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:22.060
10 and 20 years, we quote unquote fourth industrial revolution technologies.

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:29.340
We'll hit some type of sci-fi level of capability.

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:36.460
And input them all here, you know, biotech belongs on this maybe quantum computing

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.420
genetic type of things. But I don't think they're as relevant for this discussion.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:46.860
The ones that I think are relevant are these. So AI, machine learning.

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:52.700
We've been talking about this for a very long time. On the whole, it has been

01:06:52.700 --> 01:07:02.300
generally less exciting than people have expected. But we are not far away from the timeline that

01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:11.420
some of the big AI thinkers, none of that, you'll start seeing big leaps in the 2020s. And what

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:19.420
we're seeing from AI platforms like stable diffusion for creating images, opening AI and chat GPT,

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.940
GPT, we may decide that, I mean, you know, Google search results are a form of AI, right?

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:30.220
Patch.com's feed is a form of AI, adds your big serves as a form of AI. We have those

01:07:30.220 --> 01:07:40.060
aside. And they're already forms of AI. We are starting to see the beginning of AI that works

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:47.100
for practical human things, that writes essays, that drives cars reasonably well in some conditions

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:58.060
that can generate poems and photos. And you can look at them now and say, oh, this here is an error.

01:07:58.060 --> 01:08:03.740
And here's another error. And here's this thing that's going wrong. And I think for the purpose of

01:08:03.740 --> 01:08:11.260
this analysis, it doesn't matter because all those things are getting better every month.

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:20.620
So, pick whatever time frame you want. You think it's three years, you think it's seven years,

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:29.260
you think it's 17 years, it's not 353 years. Within the lifetime of almost everyone

01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:37.420
in the audience there, we will see extremely capable AI's. A, B.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:46.380
Most major countries are heading towards some form of central bank digital currency.

01:08:47.980 --> 01:08:54.380
Central bank digital currencies are natively digital currencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum,

01:08:55.660 --> 01:09:02.060
but permission with central points of control, central points of programmability. This is viewed

01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:12.220
as a feature, not as a bug. It is viewed as a feature that will allow governments to implement

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:22.460
automated rules from at the most basic level, antibody laundering and no-year customer rules to

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:30.940
make sure that you have a very low level of control, negative interest rates to socially desirable spending rules.

01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:41.180
You can only spend this much on carbon or meats or what have you this month,

01:09:41.180 --> 01:09:49.340
like you've passed your limit. So, these are payment systems and they are payment systems

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:59.340
that, as described by some of their proponents, are much more directive than the payment systems of

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:06.220
our whole lives that ultimately have allowed for most of our lives to be a practical degree,

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:15.020
also the possibility of cash. It is fascinating to me how the social construction over the course

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:27.420
of my lifetime has taken cash from being a perfectly normal wholesome thing. When I was a little kid,

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:34.220
I said, oh, look, you've got your allowance, cash, it's normal. Here's a five dollar bill.

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:42.860
When I was at university, I operated as far as I could remember primarily in cash. I'd go to the ATM,

01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:51.260
take up cash for the week, and everyone thought this was perfectly normal. Of course, everyone's aware

01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:58.620
that there is some percentage of tax evasion from cash, there is some percentage of money laundering,

01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:07.340
drug dealing, as well as all true things, and it is correct that law enforcement authorities

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:17.180
chase these things around, which they should do. But we have gone from a presumption that cash is

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:26.540
default normal, even wholesome, don't say, to a presumption that cash is default suspicious

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:33.260
and should be eliminated, the quote unquote, death of cash. Many countries

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:41.020
here in Europe have now put limits on how much cash you can take out. Israel's done something

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:49.020
somewhere. And within the European Union, there is an absolute strong push to keep producing those

01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:57.180
loans. So we will, it is viewed as socially desirable by many parties to eliminate cash.

01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:05.020
And then you'll have a fully permissioned system for spending, which will be

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:13.580
solved as done. We will prevent spending on inappropriate things.

01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:24.060
So then the next one, mixed reality. Mixed reality, as we saw earlier in this course is

01:12:24.060 --> 01:12:30.860
augmented and virtual reality. Once again, over a practical timeframe, it's going to be awesome.

01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:38.140
Our glasses are contact lenses, maybe in the fullness of time or neural implants, but I don't know how

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.820
that one seems like it has a ways ahead of it. But our glasses, we're sure,

01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:53.420
will overlay Google Maps in your field division. They will bring fiddensas into common fields of

01:12:53.420 --> 01:13:00.220
vision. They will remind you who the person was at the conference. They will allow you to

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:09.740
transform your working space both aesthetically, but also for productive purposes. Why am I limited to

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:19.500
25 inch screens? Don't worry, you won't be. We will work, we will be able to work and move through

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:28.380
arbitrarily large digital and mixed reality spaces. It's wonderful. It will lead to better

01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:34.860
productivity. It will lead to more immersive gaming. It will lead to more human level communication.

01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:42.300
Your friends, family, loved ones, romantic partners who are not living near you.

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:50.140
You will see them full size in your field of vision. It's an improvement. It's an improvement

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:56.140
in the quality of human life. It's great. But again, hold that thought.

01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:06.060
Big data capture, capturing of all the data, the amount of data that the first three

01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:17.100
are going to create will be staggering. And interestingly, the third, you know,

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:20.220
on the ground, he will start picking up by a metric data.

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:24.380
On the reality has

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:30.780
cameras in your field of vision. It might have,

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:40.380
in time, cameras looking at dry. It has much more intrusive data than even the most intrusive

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:49.980
ads you see on life. They'll be able to know in time, are you scared? Are you happy?

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:52.540
Are you lying?

01:14:52.540 --> 01:15:01.420
Are you feeling pleasure from whatever it is that you're watching?

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:12.940
Are you socially compliant? Are you a socially compliant?

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:20.380
No, these things are not in a far sci-fi future, they are within a practical future.

01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:26.700
They're not today, we're not there yet. But they're also not 100 years away.

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:31.340
And so you will have these gigantic data streams that

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:37.020
are being driven from the first three. And then, you know,

01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.720
on Metaverse, which was the name of this course,

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.420
which I had said earlier in the course,

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:44.620
and I stand by my definition, it's the internet,

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:49.300
but with better visualization and persistent visual objects.

01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:52.540
And so you put these together,

01:15:52.540 --> 01:15:57.540
and the good part is our digital experience

01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.580
is about to get much, much better.

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:04.580
In 10 to 20 years, I'm looking at my computer screens now,

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:13.900
they're basically the same user experience

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:18.900
as the early browsers with slightly better graphics.

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:26.860
The early Netscape was not an order of magnitude different,

01:16:26.860 --> 01:16:31.860
and I don't know if there's no doubt in 10 or 20 years,

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.860
we're gonna look at this and it's gonna look antiquated.

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.860
It was like, gosh, how did people even live that way?

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:39.860
How did people even work that way?

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:43.860
Can you believe the old people used to use the internet

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:48.860
like this, because it's going to become much more realistic,

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.860
much more interactive, it will be a blended space

01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:54.860
of humans and aliens, and it's going to be

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.860
a blended space of humans and AIs.

01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:02.860
There will be AIs to help with anything,

01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:07.860
not just driving, not just walking you through the Oof EZ,

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:12.860
but I'm pretty sure our education's gonna change,

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:15.860
and pretty sure the current model of education

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:19.860
is going to get completely rescaled by AIs.

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:21.860
It's all of us gonna be wonderful,

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.860
and we'll have a lot of features, but there's a dark side too,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.860
and the dark side looks something like the following.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:38.860
You will have basically the ability for a company

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.860
or a government to have permanent,

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:47.860
holistic surveillance of everyone's environment.

01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:54.860
We have already made great leaps in this area.

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:02.860
All of us carry around with us a microphone, at all times.

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.860
Which, for most phones and most jurisdictions and most cars,

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:12.860
can also be switched on remotely without you knowing.

01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:14.860
If you have told someone in, I don't know,

01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:19.860
the 1980s in East Germany under the quite interest of Stasi,

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:24.860
that in the future, people in free countries

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:28.860
will make sure they jam a microphone in their pocket

01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:30.860
wherever they go.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.860
People might be surprised, but yet we did,

01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.860
because it's convenient and useful, and it's nice to have cell phones,

01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.860
and cell phones now have all these features,

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.860
and they have microphones and cameras, and they're pretty useful.

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.860
But it's gonna be much more in them, right?

01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:48.860
Like our glasses will be seeing our environment.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:52.860
We'll be tracking our biometric data.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.860
We'll be tracking our biometric data, even through words, right?

01:18:57.860 --> 01:18:59.860
It'll be good for health.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.860
I have a watch on that tells me my heart rate and my steps.

01:19:03.860 --> 01:19:05.860
It's cool. It's useful.

01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:07.860
I want to know my heart rate and my steps.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:14.860
But I'm pretty sure the same song, and maybe Google, or whatever.

01:19:15.860 --> 01:19:19.860
And maybe along the transmittal path, maybe many other people,

01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:21.860
maybe national security agencies.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.860
And the national security agencies have any particular interest

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.860
in how many steps it is.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:26.860
You know, of course not.

01:19:26.860 --> 01:19:34.860
I am not that, you know, one of the things with the big data is less

01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:37.860
that someone is sitting there at the NSA,

01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.860
being like, oh, wow, six, five, seven, nine,

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.860
it's not really getting his cardio in today.

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.860
I have no idea it's time for that.

01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:45.860
There's billions of people in the world.

01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.860
But these things are valuable and interesting at the societal level,

01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.860
at the aggregate level.

01:19:52.860 --> 01:19:58.860
And so what you can do if you have this full environment

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:04.860
and you have a centralized metaverse and the internet with better visualization,

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:11.860
you can influence behavior both positively and negatively,

01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.860
basically at the subconscious level.

01:20:15.860 --> 01:20:19.860
One of my favorite

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:26.860
analogies is machines are already breeding humans.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:28.860
What if that's supposed to mean?

01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:31.860
Well, I think in the United States, something like 50% of marriages

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.860
come from dating applications.

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:38.860
And dating applications you are presented a feed.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:44.860
And that feed is trying to somehow predict who you'd like to see.

01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:48.860
Or better for worse.

01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:50.860
I'm not saying the feed has any negative attention,

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.860
but it's good attention.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:58.860
But it's some machine algorithm that's trying to find you a partner.

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.860
And sometimes that turns out to be a spouse and sometimes that to be the

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:04.860
parent of the children you have together.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:10.860
And in some weird way, a machine has put you together

01:21:10.860 --> 01:21:16.860
and the biases of that machine algorithm might change how people match up.

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.860
If they change how people match up, they might even, like,

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.860
in effect, be changing the gene code, which is weird.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:24.860
By weird to think about.

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:27.860
But I think it's kind of true.

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:39.860
And can I mention that, but more granular, more immersive, more subconscious

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:49.860
If you are given little dumping hits for doing things in

01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:57.860
society approved ways, and it can be done at scale,

01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:06.860
it doesn't matter if there isn't someone at the NSA checking in on me.

01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:15.860
Personally, in fact, all this stuff doesn't need to be 100% effective.

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:21.860
I'm going to say 80% effective, but it doesn't need to be 80% effective either.

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:28.860
In most countries, the difference between who wins an election is a few percentage points.

01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:32.860
Take the United States, you have these famous swing voters.

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:38.860
There's a bunch of people who are always in the vote Republican, a bunch of people who are always in the vote Democrat,

01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:45.860
who becomes the president, or who controls the House and the Senate, is some swing voters.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:50.860
All you need to do is subconsciously influence 5 or 10% of the population.

01:22:50.860 --> 01:22:51.860
Move them a little bit.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:59.860
Move everyone's views 5% in one direction, and you are

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:02.860
in the vote.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:05.860
That's not a good question.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:10.860
The tougher version throws in some automated compliance.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:15.860
And compliance is going to come through the payment system.

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:21.860
That's why I keep harassing everyone about this freedom to transact concept.

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:30.860
The carrot is going to be the dopamine hits.

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:35.860
The stick is a transaction we'll go through.

01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:40.860
You're not allowed to do that.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:44.860
I'm sorry, our scoring says you can't make this payment.

01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:52.860
It's going to happen.

01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:59.860
Even I wonder if I'm at times overestimating the rest of the land.

01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.860
This is where what happened in Canada with the truckers was about, how are you telling?

01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:11.860
And I say this, even though I almost certainly, from what I can tell, have the opposite political views of the truckers.

01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:15.860
They're actually sound like kind of a bunch of jerks, to be honest.

01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:24.860
But what was interesting to me is that the way that protest was resolved wasn't through kind of normal law enforcement mechanisms,

01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:31.860
but by cutting off their money and then to their families.

01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:39.860
God, that was really interesting because that's Canada, and Canada is nobody's idea of some callous dictatorship.

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:43.860
And Canada is like absurdly friendly place.

01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:44.860
Liberal democracy.

01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:47.860
In the actual liberal democracy.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.860
Objectively else, they are.

01:24:49.860 --> 01:25:01.860
And yet, Canada discovered the power of the payment system to end the protest.

01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:08.860
And you know, I'm concerned because a lot of people who should be concerned about this thing are concerned because I don't like those guys.

01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:10.860
I'm glad they did it.

01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:12.860
Most truckers had bad intentions.

01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:14.860
Maybe they did.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:24.860
The problem is people will use it sometime against your preferred speech.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:30.860
Against your preferred organization and protest or religion.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:41.860
Because once you can end the social movement, not by winning in the marketplace of ideas, not by winning in elections,

01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:47.860
not by charging them with a crime that they have actually committed.

01:25:47.860 --> 01:25:53.860
But by just saying, okay, you can't pay for stuff.

01:25:53.860 --> 01:26:01.860
There's no exit.

01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:06.860
My credit card won't process this payment, but I can go to cash.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.860
Cash is gone in this world.

01:26:09.860 --> 01:26:11.860
So you can't go to cash.

01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:15.860
This is a world where I suspect.

01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:22.860
There's at least sectors of this world that consider quote unquote self-hosted quote unquote non-custodial wallets,

01:26:22.860 --> 01:26:23.860
but it's a wallet.

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:26.860
It's where you have your money in your pocket.

01:26:26.860 --> 01:26:33.860
They want them to go away for custodial wallets and custodial wallets are not wallets at all.

01:26:33.860 --> 01:26:34.860
They're accounts.

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:37.860
They want people to have accounts, not wallets.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:48.860
I put this in here, but there's for sure a sector of the regulatory state that believes it's deserve.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.860
And they might be well intentioned.

01:26:51.860 --> 01:27:02.860
But what this will mean is you will have given people in power an immensely powerful set of tools.

01:27:02.860 --> 01:27:05.860
And here I'm going to go a little bit abstract.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:07.860
This isn't all trying its proper.

01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:11.860
Heaven is high and the emperor is far away.

01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:17.860
And what it means, particularly pre-internet days, pre-industrialized days,

01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:21.860
then, the emperor might be envisioning and has a certain view that you should enter this,

01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:28.860
or you shouldn't say that, but you're in, I don't know, the social law and profits.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:31.860
And, okay, I mean, fine.

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:33.860
The emperor thinks that.

01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:37.860
But I'm going to say there's other things to my friend.

01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:40.860
I'm going to do this other thing here.

01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:47.860
There were practical limits on their ability to enforce their power and they're good,

01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:50.860
but more importantly, bad ideas.

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:55.860
They were practically limited.

01:27:55.860 --> 01:28:08.860
What is scary about these technologies is not that they allow something that wasn't previously possible.

01:28:08.860 --> 01:28:16.860
It's that they allow it on superhuman scale, and in fact, it will be run on superhuman scale.

01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.860
It will be run by AI.

01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:27.860
And this is a set of power we've never given to anyone before.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:33.860
And it's going to be sold as socially desirable.

01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:43.860
And the question that needs to be asked, that I have yet to see good answers to,

01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.860
is who watches the watchmen?

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.860
Who guards the guards?

01:28:49.860 --> 01:29:02.860
When someone says, oh, we have the Sydney DC and the nice thing about it, it can only do transactions that are good.

01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:04.860
Sounds great.

01:29:04.860 --> 01:29:09.860
I prefer a society where people only do good transactions and don't do bad transactions.

01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:12.860
It sounds actually socially desirable.

01:29:12.860 --> 01:29:17.860
But who gets to choose them?

01:29:17.860 --> 01:29:24.860
There is usually, I've read a lot about these things, and I've spoken to people about these things.

01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.860
I've been called to advise on these things.

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.860
And there's usually very little talk about who gets to decide.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:35.860
And what is the democratic governance of those decisions?

01:29:35.860 --> 01:29:37.860
And what is the review process of those decisions?

01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.860
What's the transparency of those decisions?

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.860
How can those decisions be challenged?

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:43.860
There's close to none of that.

01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:48.860
It is assumed that the people in power can make good decisions.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:52.860
And then the people not in power will, of course, follow them because they're good decisions.

01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.860
But we've passed this.

01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:57.860
We've passed this phase in human development, right?

01:29:57.860 --> 01:30:01.860
This was a phase of pre-constitutional rights.

01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:07.860
Constitutional rights start off by saying the sovereignty is with the individual, not the state.

01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:10.860
You have to follow us, of course.

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:12.860
But are you default free?

01:30:12.860 --> 01:30:13.860
Yes.

01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:15.860
Are you default allowed to do things?

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:16.860
Yes.

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.860
Are you default allowed to own things?

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:19.860
Own things?

01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:20.860
Yes.

01:30:20.860 --> 01:30:24.860
Can the state deprive you of your rights, your freedom, your freedom of speech, your freedom of movement, your property?

01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:29.860
Not without due process.

01:30:29.860 --> 01:30:31.860
The state has to say you did something wrong.

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:33.860
The thing you did wrong is this.

01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.860
The penalty is that you have a jury of your peers.

01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:37.860
You have a lawyer.

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:39.860
You have, there's a set.

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.860
The hurdle is significant for the state to do it.

01:30:43.860 --> 01:30:53.860
And that creates a version of a level of check on state power.

01:30:53.860 --> 01:31:10.860
If we move all over this to an automated system running on private infrastructure, you know, you don't have any constitutional rights on Facebook's servers.

01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:12.860
They're not yours.

01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:13.860
They're Facebook's.

01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:20.860
Just like you don't have any constitutional right to come into Mark Zuckerberg's house and lecture him in his lover room.

01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:30.860
And this is correct because if you get out of a constitutional right to go in his servers and go in his living rooms, you'd have to assume a coercive state that would force him to let you in.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:33.860
So it's correct that you don't have any rights there.

01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:49.860
But if it turns out that we build our whole infrastructure on this type of underlying architecture, all types of policies will be implemented.

01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:53.860
They will be effectively I was unreviewable.

01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:57.860
They will be implemented at scale.

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:02.860
And they will be abused.

01:32:02.860 --> 01:32:07.860
People keep talking about the state, but the state also means people.

01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:10.860
There is someone in charge of the state.

01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.860
The United States, the executive was a president.

01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:17.860
And the president has a lot of power, Congress also has power.

01:32:17.860 --> 01:32:21.860
And those are individual people that just people just like you and me.

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:25.860
And they're not infallible.

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:31.860
And in fact, their objectives are unlikely to be wholly pure, some of them likely.

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:34.860
But they're likely all of them to be wholly pure.

01:32:34.860 --> 01:32:38.860
And so every time you sub here, the word state is a substitute person.

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:43.860
Should a person have this amount of power?

01:32:43.860 --> 01:32:47.860
Often to me, the answer is no.

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:54.860
It's not like I think George shouldn't have this amount of power, but I should.

01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.860
I don't think I should either.

01:32:57.860 --> 01:33:03.860
But I also don't think any other arbitrary person should either.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:07.860
And this is what the nature of a constitutional democracy is.

01:33:07.860 --> 01:33:15.860
The nature of a constitutional democracy puts significant limits on the government's power

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.860
versus what it used to be before with it.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:26.860
And if we lose this indirectly in the digital world, in this highly immersive digital world,

01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:28.860
it can be very problematic.

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.860
Now, okay, so this is all, you know, mostly scary.

01:33:30.860 --> 01:33:32.860
And I think it is mostly scary.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:38.860
And one of the basis of everything I've been running on the open metaverse,

01:33:38.860 --> 01:33:39.860
what can we do?

01:33:39.860 --> 01:33:41.860
I actually don't think it's much.

01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.860
Right.

01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:43.860
And it's difficult.

01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:46.860
And it's very high level.

01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:59.860
And at the first approximation is the first level of abstraction is well,

01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:07.460
Do we have the same rights digitally as we do in the physical world?

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.060
Do we have a default right to privacy online?

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:17.460
Do we have a default right to ownership online?

01:34:17.460 --> 01:34:18.500
Can you own something?

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:21.380
Can you own a piece of art?

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.420
Because to own it, you need that quote, unquote, non-custodial

01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:24.920
walk.

01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:33.400
If it has to be held in custody by Coinbase or Kraken or BitStamp or JP Morgan Chase,

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:41.320
well, no, then we're saying we trust our citizens to own a piece of art in their living room,

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:44.440
but we don't trust our citizens to own a piece of art in the inner.

01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:52.600
Which my view is that's an incorrect decision for society, right?

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.120
In any case, my view is meaning to have the discussions with society.

01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:05.960
As the world becomes more digital, there needs to be a genuine discussion among policy makers

01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:14.840
and the people of what we think the right balance of power is between the state and its citizens

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:17.640
of the world, noting that everything is a tradeoff.

01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.920
Of course, fighting crime is easier when you don't have any rights.

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:29.000
Of course, but we have decided in at least most constitutional democracies that fighting

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.600
crime is very important, but it's not the only thing that matters.

01:35:33.320 --> 01:35:36.600
Because if it was the only thing that matters, then a cop could walk into your house anytime

01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:37.720
to just check the suit you're in.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:42.120
And generally not, if I didn't get a warrant, then I'd go to court, then I'd go through some

01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.640
process, right?

01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:46.680
Because you start off with the right suit, then first level is the constitutional.

01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:51.640
The second level is, again, what I keep.

01:35:51.640 --> 01:35:57.880
I'm asking everyone about what I call freedom to transact, which it is a model of

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:01.320
there needs to still exist some

01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:08.520
default allowed system of transactions.

01:36:09.960 --> 01:36:10.920
We still have one today.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.640
It's called cash.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:15.720
You are default allowed to pay someone with cash.

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:18.760
Credit cards are not like that, right?

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:21.400
The credit card goes and goes for an impressing.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:24.920
It says yes or no, a third party says yes or no to the transaction.

01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:27.800
But cash is not.

01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:31.560
If I take $20 and I give it to someone and buy a burger and a beer,

01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.760
there's no third party in that transaction.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:38.760
I believe we need to maintain a default allowed payment system.

01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:46.120
And I believe digitally, because I don't think the CVDC is the right thing would have been

01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:50.760
for the CVDC's to become default permissions, just like cash is.

01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.040
But I don't think I'm going to do that.

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.480
I've been having discussions with the Federal Reserve for a long time.

01:36:57.480 --> 01:36:58.280
I don't do it.

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:07.240
And so that means being allowed to hold crypto assets in your own world.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.920
I think that's what the choice is going to build out to.

01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:17.720
And then the last thing, which is also part of my thesis of the one that I think I can

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.560
add the most influence on, is this metaverse with persistent digital objects needs to

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:32.760
database to store those objects. And that database can be one or several big companies.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.320
Or it can be a public blockchain.

01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:41.160
And if it's a public blockchain, we have a system to store an arbitrary digital object.

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.120
It's called an NFT.

01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:51.080
And if people can own their NFTs and then companies, organizations,

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:54.600
governments build applications to use them, that's fantastic.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:57.160
Some of those applications can be large and centralized.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.120
It's also fantastic.

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.960
But they should not control the database of record.

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.800
Because that database of record is a database for our world.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:13.640
And so to me, these are, we're at a very interesting path in the road.

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.600
We're fork in the road.

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:24.760
I think the decisions that are made in the 2020s, over the next four years,

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:35.160
will determine what the architecture and ultimately the human rights architecture of our life will be

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.160
in the 2030s and afters.

01:38:38.840 --> 01:38:44.680
I think because of the network effects and the kind of monopolistic effects or all

01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:50.040
monopolistic effects of the internet, whatever system gets established in the next few years will

01:38:50.040 --> 01:38:51.240
become the system that wins.

01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:57.720
Just like it's hard to get off Twitter, if everyone stores their,

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:03.400
take a simple example, digital art is an NFT, then artists will be making digital art as NFT

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.040
in the 2030s.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:09.960
If everyone stores it on Facebook art service, that's what's going to work.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.080
We'll find out which one it is over these few years.

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:18.440
I think it is, there are things we can do.

01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:22.280
I don't think it's clear which way it's going to go.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:28.200
In some countries, it is clear that it's going to go on the permission side.

01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.640
I guess you should probably state this in reverse.

01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:35.960
In many countries, they've already decided they're going to permission route.

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:40.680
China seems to be building out and permission block shame.

01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:41.880
Architecture.

01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.280
And then the question is, if the other countries, if there will be countries,

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.240
that run an open architecture.

01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:51.800
I hope they do.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.560
I think it's going to be better for the world that they do.

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:55.720
I don't think it will happen automatically.

01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.680
I don't think it will happen without people, you know,

01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:09.000
having a discussion about what they think they deserve from as a citizen in a digital world.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.320
And I'm hoping we can help stimulate some of that discussion.

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.200
So I'm going to stop here.

01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:20.600
This is probably the most personal of the presentations on the other ones.

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.280
I tried to be somehow neutral.

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.880
I am not neutral here.

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:28.360
I think that's probably fair to say.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:34.840
I do not think it is 50 50, if we should have a completely permission.

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:38.840
And digital architecture versus a permissionless one.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:43.000
And it's equally good for society if we have either one.

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:44.520
I am.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.680
I have a point of view or a bias, if you want to call it.

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.680
But that's what I'm sharing in this presentation.

01:40:54.680 --> 01:40:56.760
So I am going to stop here.

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:01.640
George of it, if I can maybe look at some questions.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:11.000
And I'll maybe for another 15 minutes or so.

01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:41.560
I'm trying to get into the score where the questions are.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.640
Oh my gosh, it's not yelling at me.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:42:06.280
Okay.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:26.640
Okay, I think I'm in.

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.640
So, it's more glitch.

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:39.640
Okay, there are a few questions regarding the exam. I will take this and then there are a couple of questions for six five to nine.

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:51.640
So, first question, will completing this course count toward course credit for unique and assist students that we can share is no.

01:42:51.640 --> 01:43:08.640
In the future, we plan to have a for credit version of this course, as you might remember from our initial lectures, the university of negotiated in the process of accrediting a new master's degree, the master's in metaverse systems we hope to.

01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:16.640
To be able to launch this in the coming couple of months and the first class will start in September 2023.

01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:31.640
So, if this happens, this course will be made into a credit course, it will have a different form of assessment, obviously, for the students that are taking it for credit.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:47.640
So, the short answer is that this particular course with this particular assessment that I mentioned the multiple choice quiz for the end will not count towards towards course credit for our students.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:56.640
Another question is the certificate generative art, as I've said, we don't have all the details yet so I cannot commit, but most likely.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:58.640
Yes.

01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:05.640
Another question, is there a way to do the full course to obtain the certification.

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:09.640
I'm not sure what exactly the student means here.

01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:22.640
I mean, this is the full course. So, if you take the exam and score 60% or higher as I've said, you will get the certificate of completion as an NFT on Ethereum.

01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:35.640
If you would like to do so. So, yeah, I don't know if you meant something else, please let us know.

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:41.640
6'5 to 9", I don't know if you have access to the questions or do you want me to read them for you because I think they're.

01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:55.640
I have them, I see three of them here. The first one I'm laughing, I don't mean.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:16.640
Yeah. Both, I guess. I'm going to go with both. I don't know, usually these things do start for pleasure, don't be George. So, I'm going to say both, but if that's wrong, it's probably pleasure first in business afterwards.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:27.640
That pleasure is a business, isn't it? So, yeah, it might be pleasure for the end user, but it might be a business application for the ones who develop some markets.

01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:55.640
Yep, yep, yep. All right, is the network state a new hybrid global structure, or does it become an alternative pseudo digital government place? So, this is very

01:45:55.640 --> 01:46:09.640
difficult and interesting question. I've spoken about it with biology and we'll discuss this with him on his session because he's the expert on it.

01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:26.640
And he has a more ambitious view of it, that makes sense of his concept. But he thinks of it even taking on indirectly physical space.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:40.640
And I'm going to say his view.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:59.640
And he controls physical space, it's like this.

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:13.640
Very long time, if ever, give up default control of societal governance.

01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:32.640
And so what this, what I think these are going to be, are groups of people who operate in parallel to this. I mean, is the Catholic Church a network state.

01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:56.640
And so, it's a very valuable, yes, right, like there's many people around the world who share a set of values, who contribute economically to those values, who have shared physical facilities around the world.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:12.640
And in some countries, universities, the Vatican also has a very small nation state, but I don't think that's the important part. I mean, the Catholic Church, I think, by biology is a network state.

01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:31.640
In mature nation states, people are fine with this, right, in some nation states they are, it was all they want to like control it, but like in my current nation states, like the Catholic Church and share your beliefs with others and that's fine.

01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:56.640
And so I think it's conceptually for me it's conceptually like that. It's something like, and I'm not saying it's like a religion, from that perspective, but it's something like a religion in how it can be, it's a different layer of people's lives organized in parallel to the nation state.

01:48:56.640 --> 01:49:02.640
So, I think that's how it ends up.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:21.640
Okay, can you comment on feudalistic state, web 3 appears to be from a societal evolution perspective, or if you disagree with this view, do you think the development of space will follow a parallel path to societal evolution but it's sped up right?

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:26.640
I don't think I understand the question to be honest.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.640
I think web 2 is more feudalistic right now than web 3.

01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:37.640
I think web 2 is almost, almost completely feudalistic.

01:49:37.640 --> 01:50:01.640
So, if you work, if you make a large part of your life on Facebook, well, you don't really have any rights at all there, right? They can just end your account at any time for any reason.

01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:10.640
That's it, I don't really anything. And that seems to me to be a feudal type relationship.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:19.640
Web 3 I don't think is that way, necessarily, and definitely not as bad.

01:50:19.640 --> 01:50:33.640
I think we have an opportunity to have self sovereign actions in web 3 that perhaps we don't do web 2.

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:41.640
That's how I understand the question list.

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:49.640
Do you have any other ones or have I bored everyone to death already on the stop?

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:55.640
I don't see any other questions, no, I think this covers it all.

01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:06.640
I guess we can renew our appointment for next Wednesday unless we amount something earlier than that which I don't think so at this stage.

01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:10.640
It's only Baladji that is missing, correct?

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:12.640
Yeah, we'll see.

01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:15.640
We don't have any concerns now, but we will.

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:36.640
For Baladji, nobody in the next panel discussion is next Wednesday with regarding the metaverse and it's with Ryan from Momsiber, Charlie Cohen and Maxxin Perumal, correct?

01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:42.640
That one's going to be wild. We have Ryan and Maxxin and Charlie, it's going to be wild.

01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:49.640
A lot of different and exciting viewpoints in that one.

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:51.640
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:57.640
Okay, we all are and you're going to be moderating it, so I'm sure it's going to be fine.

01:51:57.640 --> 01:52:01.640
Great, so I'll see you next week then, everyone.

01:52:01.640 --> 01:52:02.640
All right.

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:04.640
Bye bye for now.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:05.640
Bye bye.

01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:07.640
Bye bye.
