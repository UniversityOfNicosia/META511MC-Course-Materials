00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000


2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:25,760
Well, thank you so much everyone as always for joining.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
This is session five of META-511.

4
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
Today we're going to talk about generative art.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,000
And I don't know if this is my favorite art topic in NFTs, but if it's not my favorite,

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,440
it's very close to my favorite.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
And in any case, it's a topic I'm very, very excited about.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,480
So let me see if I can get the presentation up and running.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,520
Oh, we have the presentation of the story.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,920
So like last week, the presentation is pretty good, but not 100% final.

11
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,640
There are a couple of tweaks that I would like to make.

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,120
So we won't mint this right away, but we'll mint it in a few days.

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,280
And I still owe you the one-on-one presentation.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,920
I want to take a moment on this one in particular and really thank NooNe0x.

15
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,160
He's helped him certainly with the prior presentations, but this one, as you're seeing it today,

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
is entirely his work.

17
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,440
I need to make some small adjustments that I want to add from our interviews.

18
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,800
But really, I did not make this presentation.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,120
NooNe0x did

20
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,360
It's a really good job.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,200
And I want to thank him for helping me here.

22
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,320
So let's go through it.

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,840
OK.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,640
Let's start here.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:52,800
And I think the first message that I would like to pass along is that generative art is

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,840
not something new.

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,240
It's not something that started with NFTs.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,880
It's not something that started with blockchains.

29
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,560
It has a long history.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,640
And the general way that I think about it, that I think someone can think about it, is

31
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:27,280
that part of the output or all of the output or some aspect of the output is generated procedurally,

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,760
autonomously, outside of the artist's control.

33
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,080
And so this, to me, is the key point about generative art, which is very different than

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:46,040
saying I'm going to take a photograph and then I'm going to work on it and Photoshop

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,840
and then I'm going to print it or I'm going to make a painting.

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,000
And all of those things are 100% the artist has created it.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,640
Here in generative art, of course, the art is created by the artist.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,240
But the way to think about the art that the artist is creating is to say the artist is

39
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,920
creating a system that creates the art, a procedure that creates the art, that has

40
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,640
some type of input from the outside world and that input from the outside world help

41
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,840
generate the piece.

42
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:30,440
So we have art known back in our presentation again, just like we did last week.

43
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,600
I would generalize this, right?

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,200
So here it says, a computer introduces randomness as part of the creation.

45
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,360
This is true, it's 100% true, but it doesn't have to be a computer.

46
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,760
You have the example at the beginning of the Aeolian harp.

47
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,560
The wind was creating part of the artwork.

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,040
You could have a physical object creating part of the artwork.

49
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,640
I've even seen generative art where biological processes are creating part of the artwork

50
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,280
and so that where you have actual chemical reactions or biological reactions, the

51
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,280
the outcome of those reactions feeds into the artwork.

52
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:21,800
So yes, it is absolutely true that in practice, in most generative art, the independent actor,

53
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,320
the non-human actor is in fact a computer.

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:33,920
But it can be any process that is not the human artist themselves.

55
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:42,080
So generative art as a movement.

56
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:49,000
I think my sense is it's mid-century.

57
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,840
I haven't mentioned these things.

58
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,000
You can argue if it's the 1960s or 1940s or 1950s.

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:09,240
I think in the mid-century it comes out of a world of avant-garde art and futurism and

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,480
bowels, but it's also a different thing.

61
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:21,080
It's almost impossible to imagine it would have developed this way if at the same time

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,560
you didn't have the first computers coming into you.

63
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:41,400
So I truly think generative art and its breadth in the 1950s to 2020 period is in fact linked

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,920
with the rise of the computer.

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,920
Just like I'm going to argue that the next phase is linked to the rise of watching it.

66
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,400
Could there be a lot of designable computers?

67
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,960
Could there have been generative art in the past like the readers?

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,320
Yes, there could have been, there was.

69
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,720
But is it very natural once you have the power of computation to think to yourself, how can

70
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:17,880
they, how can computers generate art, generate beauty?

71
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:25,080
Because the nice thing about today's presentation is there's a lot of pictures in it.

72
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm going to go through all the slides and we will see some very interesting images,

73
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,560
but I'm not going to talk about each one because if I do we'll be here for four hours, not

74
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
one hour.

75
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:44,760
And so some of the things will go through fairly quickly, but what this presentation has is

76
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,200
a lot of the historically important generative artists and the currently important generative

77
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,160
artists and by no means an exhaustive list, right?

78
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,960
There's hundreds and there's maybe 15 of this presentation.

79
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,400
But for someone who does not know generative art well and following up checking these folks

80
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,000
looking at their work, we'll start to give you a sense of how this movement has evolved.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:29,360
Yeah, and I think this is, this is the part where I'm mostly going to flip through slides.

82
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:39,360
And now I mostly want you to get a sense of the style.

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,200
As opposed to we need to do a deep dive on each artist.

84
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:53,480
By the way, Herbert Frank very recently passed away and he was a legend in the field and

85
00:07:53,480 --> 00:08:02,720
just before he passed away, there was an NFT collection of some of his pre NFT works.

86
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,480
He's been working for many decades.

87
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:12,320
And then now there are a lot of tribute collections to him is beloved in the community.

88
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:22,560
And it's thought of as an important pioneer.

89
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,400
This era, you can see how they are computer influenced.

90
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:45,320
It's obvious that these are things that came up in the era of computers.

91
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:56,600
Similarly, if I asked someone to look at this in yesterday's session, this is digital art

92
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
as our last week session.

93
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
This is digital art.

94
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,840
And is it generative art or digital art?

95
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,560
Yeah, usually yes.

96
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,720
But could this have been digital art and not generative?

97
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes, of course.

98
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,320
Someone could have.

99
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:27,500


100
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:43,360
Again, giving a flavor to the stage of the era.

101
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,800
Vera is also very interesting.

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:55,880
She is, she dropped an NFT collection this year at the age of 98.

103
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,880
So it's really quite incredible.

104
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:08,240
And it included some of her earliest work.

105
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:28,880
And she's like Herbert and other artists here considered an absolute pioneer in this field.

106
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Again, another set of incredible artists.

107
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:53,720
And think of what we just went through as the historic precedent for this field, right?

108
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,940
And this field is in the NFT space in the blockchain space.

109
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:17,260
What I think is interesting about generative art NFTs is that I, and here's a concept I

110
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:25,000
would like to communicate, is that I think they found their natural medium with the blockchain.

111
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:34,340
And in fact, my argument is that the vast majority of the field is generative.

112
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:40,780
And I had a long chat yesterday with Snowfro, which will be released on Monday.

113
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:47,700
And I was very pleased, intellectually pleased to hear that he thinks exactly the same thing.

114
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,180
In fact, he became involved.

115
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,500
He was a generative artist before NFTs.

116
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:58,620
And he became involved in the NFT space because of the crypto punks.

117
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,260
He claimed a lot of crypto punks.

118
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:07,540
He claimed 34 zombies, which is a mentally mind-boggling number.

119
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,020
But he was excited about the crypto punks because they were generative.

120
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,020
He was a generative artist.

121
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,740
And then he went on to found Art Blocks we'll talk about.

122
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:29,340
And the thing that is accurate, I believe, about this space is most PFP collections are

123
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:36,940
also a light form of generative art.

124
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,660
The crypto punks were not drawn 10,000 punks one at a time.

125
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:51,180
The crypto punks were drawn by an algorithm and a random algorithm.

126
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,980
And they are close to a billion possible crypto punks.

127
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,940
People don't think about this, but it's true.

128
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,900
You see those 10,000 crypto punks as well, it's kind of obvious that obviously some trait

129
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,860
combinations are missing.

130
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,380
There is not, for example, a hoodie alien.

131
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:22,620
But if you do the factorial math of how many crypto punks could have been created, it's

132
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
close to a billion.

133
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,220
And over those billion, 10,000 were created.

134
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:34,260
So the design space was a billion and actually 10,000 punks were created.

135
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,380
And this is generative.

136
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,380
It's algorithmic.

137
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
It has randomization.

138
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:47,660
It is, in my view, appropriately thought of as generative art.

139
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:59,540
And of course, it's vastly less complex than the generative art that is created explicitly

140
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,740
as generative art, as opposed to PFPs.

141
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,420
But it doesn't change the fact that the PFPs are also generative.

142
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,260
In this case, if you look at the space at large and you look at the activity in the

143
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:16,180
space at large, or the market cap, or any metric of activity.

144
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:25,300
Almost the whole space, 80% plus is generative.

145
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,220
And this is, I think about this all the time.

146
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,380
And it was, you commented from both directions.

147
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:36,300
Most of the NFT space is generative.

148
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:41,700
And there has been an explosion in generative art, both in terms of how many artists are

149
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,140
working, how many people are collecting, how much.

150
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,860
How you as being transacted in generative art.

151
00:14:49,860 --> 00:15:01,500
And I think it is because this is the natural home for it, the natural medium for it.

152
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:14,740
And NFTs are a medium that is as two interesting components.

153
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,020
The first interesting component is that it is digital.

154
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:23,060
It's digitally native, right?

155
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,540
It's not a computer.

156
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:32,580
Another component is that it is, preferably it is what it is.

157
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,900
It can make, because it's our blockchain, it can make all types of statements about what

158
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
it is.

159
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,260
And all those statements are provably true.

160
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:55,140
And those two things together suddenly create a framework that didn't exist before.

161
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:05,260
That allows you to do very interesting, provably true things on a computer and express those

162
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
as NFTs.

163
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:15,900
Well, what I would say is NFTs are not a surprise that NFTs are largely generative and generative

164
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,700
has done incredibly well in the era of NFTs.

165
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Because NFTs combine two distinct features.

166
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,660
They are in computers.

167
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,820
They are digital.

168
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,900
And they are on blockchains.

169
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,700
And what do we know about blockchains?

170
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,900
We know that blockchains can make provably true statements.

171
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,260
And so, what does this mean?

172
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,820
Why is this relevant to everything?

173
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,620
What do you mean by provably true statements?

174
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,820
And I'll go through some of them.

175
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:02,060
The first provably true statement you can make, take something like the crypto punks, is that

176
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:08,060
there are 10,000 crypto punks.

177
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,860
And this sounds trivial.

178
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,020
Why is this hard?

179
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,580
Why is this a big deal?

180
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:26,260
Well, you can't actually do this with none NFTs.

181
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:35,820
If I started drawing 6529 punks and started handing them out or selling them in a gallery

182
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,540
or selling them on my website, and I said, I'm going to make 10,000 of them.

183
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:45,940
But no more, there's no way for me to prove them.

184
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:53,140
There's no way for you to know that I didn't make 10,001.

185
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:57,180
I might have one hidden in my closet.

186
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:03,620
Even if it's true, even if you audited me, checked in all my cupboards underneath my desk,

187
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:12,020
said, I go, okay, we're convinced 6529, only made 10,000, 6529 punks.

188
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,380
While a year from now or 10 years from now, I could change my mind.

189
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,380
I could decide to make another one.

190
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:26,500
So this ability to make a hard commitment on, I think the most simple thing that there

191
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:30,580
are 10,000 crypto punks is new.

192
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,620
Anyone can go audit it.

193
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,420
Anyone can go to the blockchain and see that that contract has exactly 10,000 tokens.

194
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
And that's done.

195
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,580
It's not going to change.

196
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:49,500
The second part that you can do, and let me start again with the EZ mode, which is PFPs,

197
00:18:49,500 --> 00:19:01,820
you can prove that the collection was algorithmically generated and that the collection was not

198
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,620
previously known by the creators.

199
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:12,140
So a common structure of a PFP contract is that it brings in a source of randomness from

200
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,140
Chainlink.

201
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,700
It's another blockchain.

202
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,020
And that is an oracle.

203
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:28,900
And that source of randomness determines what traits you get in your PFP at the time that

204
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,900
you're minting.

205
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:39,060
That way, the creators don't know what exactly the collection will look like.

206
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,180
They don't know which PFPs would be quote unquote the good ones.

207
00:19:45,180 --> 00:20:00,660
And the, it's probably random.

208
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:05,820
And you know this because the contracts on the blockchain and the PFPs are on the blockchain.

209
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,420
They're auditable by anyone.

210
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:13,620
This actually gets even more complicated in actual generative art collections.

211
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:22,460
So I had a long discussion about this with Snowfro, the founder of Art blocks, yesterday.

212
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:26,780
And that session is going to be released on Monday.

213
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:33,820
And Art blocks has a very sophisticated process to generate pseudo-randomness.

214
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:39,380
So when you mint something, when you mint an Art Blocks pieces, it takes all types of

215
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:48,940
data from the internet and even from your wall and creates the randomness that generates

216
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,540
the piece.

217
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:58,580
So one thing that people sometimes think that is not actually accurate is let's say you

218
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,420
minted Fidenza 314.

219
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:10,420
What is up here on this slide is a very well-known Fidenza that I collected over year

220
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,420
ago.

221
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,420
It's Fidenza 313 the tulip.

222
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,420
It's very nice.

223
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:21,620
And let's say you minted Fidenza 314 and you think to yourself, oh man, if I just if I

224
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:28,580
just had minted a little bit earlier, I would have gotten Fidenza 313.

225
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,500
You would have not gotten Fidenza 313.

226
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:58,520
You would have gotten, you might have gotten Fidenza till

227
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:04,380
it's even calculable.

228
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,380
How many potential ones there are?

229
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,380
I think it might be unbounded.

230
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,100
I haven't done them after a double-check, but I think it might be unbounded.

231
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,860
And so there is this endless universe of possible Fidenza.

232
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:21,260
And then there were a thousand that were minted.

233
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:33,420
And those 1,000 were in a way co-created with the collector, the minter, because the specific

234
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:43,940
Fidenza that was specifically created at that point in time had to do with when you pressed

235
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,700
the button and who you were and from which wallet you minted and so on.

236
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,140
This is something very new, very different, right?

237
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
Like it doesn't.

238
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,940
It is very different than the traditional way generative art was made.

239
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,540
Where in Gaudier studio, you would create an algorithm.

240
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,980
You would run the algorithm yourself.

241
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:15,300
You'd see a lot of outputs.

242
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,300
You'd pick some.

243
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
Let's say you're five best.

244
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,460
And then you'd make them real in some type of physical object, maybe you printed them.

245
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,340
Maybe an installation that included your computer.

246
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:35,420
And then you took it to the gallery and you said, look, here are five really nice pieces.

247
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:38,620
And I made them with my algorithm.

248
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,740
And I went to the other very nice and I'd like to collect and put them on my wall.

249
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,740
And this is wonderful and fine and there's nothing wrong with what I just said.

250
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:58,900
But what is happening today with generative art collections is much richer, and much more exciting.

251
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:08,380
And I know what happens is an artist creates an algorithm.

252
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:17,700
That algorithm is provably, understandably, that algorithm.

253
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
You can't fake it.

254
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,580
This is the algorithm.

255
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,460
And when people mint, random variables are pushed into the algorithm and the pieces come

256
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
out.

257
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:36,540
And so it is 100% true that Tower Hobbes, the creator of Fidenzas, did not know which Fidenzas

258
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:44,180
would be created until the Art Blocks meant grand and 1000 Fidenzas were created.

259
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:50,700
Well, this is both, I think, possibly a higher level of challenge, right?

260
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,140
Because a very good collection of this type.

261
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:00,420
It has to produce good outputs across the whole collection.

262
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:06,500
You don't have the luxury of having 10,000 outputs of which 9,900 are not very good,

263
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,620
but five are interesting you take back and say, look, that algorithm may be fine, which

264
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
is fine.

265
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,620
There's no problem with that.

266
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,380
But you've made five good outputs.

267
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,940
You have to create hundreds of good outputs.

268
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,900
And you don't have to, but it'll be more valued if it does.

269
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,300
And in some way, and this is a small land, we'll talk about another collection where

270
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:33,700
it's a bigger way, the collector was a co-creator with you.

271
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:42,340
A sort of mechanical co-creator, to be honest, in this case, but nonetheless, a co-creator.

272
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,900
Tower Hobbes generated a term for this.

273
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,340
It's called the long form generative art.

274
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,740
It's on the next slide.

275
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:58,980
But the idea of long form generative art is where the artist does not select the pieces.

276
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:06,580
The pieces are created by the algorithm in combination with the mentors.

277
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:13,700
And everyone discovers at the end what the collection looks like.

278
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:22,900
And what is thought to be interesting in these collections?

279
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,780
What collectors look for?

280
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,340
What I look for?

281
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,180
For those who don't know, I'm thought of as pretty good at collecting generative art.

282
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,820
And the mental model that I think we mostly have is the phone.

283
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:48,060
Are the outputs of the art visually appealing or interesting?

284
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:55,420
A, B. Do they look sufficiently different from each other?

285
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:03,140
And an algorithm that creates the same image but changes a couple of colors is not hugely

286
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
interesting.

287
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:15,260
An algorithm that creates a widespread of surprising images is more interesting.

288
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:25,100
And then the third part is doing the collection nonetheless hold together and do the pieces

289
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,980
look like they came from the same collection.

290
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
This is challenging.

291
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,980
There are hundreds of generative art collections out there.

292
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:44,220
And I respect all of them but also obviously some people have succeeded in creating higher

293
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,940
levels of complexity in their work.

294
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,420
More aesthetically interesting.

295
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:58,740
And hitting these three parameters that they're aesthetically interesting, they are each

296
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:11,460
pieces different and that the pieces are unified within a collection.

297
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,020
This is what we've now and I think Tyler certainly popularized the term.

298
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,380
It's what we call long form generative art.

299
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:25,980
And what you're looking at here on this slide, there's another fit-ins, then the middle is

300
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,260
ringers by the microtroniac was another exceptional generative artist.

301
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,340
And on the right is a chromie squiggle by Snowfro.

302
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,620
We'll see on Monday.

303
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:48,140
And short form, you see this is not more showing fiddensis as a short form at the top

304
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,380
but obviously, fiddensis are not short form.

305
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,940
Short form would be the traditional model.

306
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:58,700
The artist generates a variety of outputs by themselves and then picks them and says

307
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,060
we're going to mint these.

308
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,980
Long form is the artist doesn't select any at all.

309
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:13,820
We will discover what the pieces are when they are minted by the mentors when they are

310
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,660
co-created by the artist and the collectors.

311
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:26,380
It is possible that I've heard but I find this absolutely fascinating, absolutely amazing.

312
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,540
Thrilling, to be honest.

313
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,460
Every, the major platform today for long-form generative art has been Art Blocks.

314
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,020
There are new ones popping up now but historically it's been Art Blocks.

315
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:52,420
And multiple times a week or sometimes every couple of weeks they have new drops, new

316
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,020
collections that are minted.

317
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:02,900
And the, it is genuinely to me very excited.

318
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,420
I'm often there at the drops.

319
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,460
Sometimes I'm in, sometimes I'll collect afterward.

320
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:15,860
And what's interesting is seeing the art be created in real-time in front of you.

321
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:23,780
You will see as people mint new pieces are created, new outputs are created and you can

322
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:31,020
see how the collection is being formed and you're seeing it at the same time as the artist

323
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
is seeing it.

324
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,020
Right?

325
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
That's incredible.

326
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:40,700
And not just you, you as not a collector, you could be literally anybody on the planet.

327
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:46,340
Anybody on the planet can be sitting there refreshing the collection as people mint and

328
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:56,140
watching a collection of art, a collection of work being created in real-time.

329
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:03,780
Probably from the algorithm, probably the way the artist says it is.

330
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:10,940
I find this absolutely fascinating, absolutely interesting, super interactive and engaging.

331
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:22,700
I also think it is somehow reflective of an era we are entering and the era we are entering

332
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:28,860
well, we've really been there for probably a couple of decades, but it will continue

333
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
to be this way.

334
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:40,700
We're in an era that is a very much a hybrid era of humans and machines.

335
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:48,260
If you took away from me my computer and my cell phone, which is just another computer

336
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,780
of course.

337
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:55,100
I am not the same person.

338
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,020
I am nowhere near as effective.

339
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,660
I am used to using them to do everything it is that I do, right?

340
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:13,540
From the most simple thing, calling a friend, sending an email, making a presentation, tweeting,

341
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:22,580
buying things, selling things, we are in a hybrid environment.

342
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:31,300
Generative art as it is today is an extremely well blended hybrid environment of person

343
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,260
and machine, the person being both the artist, the machine in this case being a blockchain

344
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:45,500
and the computation around it, it is not just a blockchain computation and the mentor and

345
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,500
collector.

346
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:58,700
This is a legendary, legendary Argentinian, generative artist.

347
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:08,700
Manly works primarily in short form, but his work is exceptional.

348
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,260
Those red trees is another piece that I had collected with some of my colleagues.

349
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,500
It is wild that that is created by a computer.

350
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,940
It is an incredible piece of work.

351
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:36,980
This hybrid environment, this human-machine hybrid environment, I think is reflective

352
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,900
of how we live now.

353
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:48,460
This is who we are.

354
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:55,900
It is very well suited to our age, my view.

355
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,540
I think we will see a lot more of it.

356
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:10,340
This doesn't, we spoke last week that there was one of one art and digital art and crypto

357
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:14,540
art and one of one art is just art.

358
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:24,620
Digital art is a subset of one of one art, but digital art is getting pretty broad and

359
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:30,980
diffuse and a lot of things are digital art and it is not clear that just including a

360
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,140
digital tool in art is necessarily reflective of digital art.

361
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:45,580
Or maybe it needs to interact with the medium more and then crypto art being a subset of

362
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:52,940
digital art and crypto art is very clearly aesthetic movement.

363
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:57,340
On NFTs there is going to be NFTs, of course, digital in the broad sense.

364
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,300
They include an NFT token, that is digital.

365
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:07,340
But there is going to be a wide variety of aesthetics in the NFT space, not just crypto

366
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:12,020
art, of traditional landscape photography, that is a aesthetic.

367
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:16,660
But crypto art certainly will be an important movement that reflects the space.

368
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:28,380
General of art, I view it almost closer to digital art in the sense that it is a horizontal

369
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,380
technology.

370
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:36,620
When I was saying I think generative art is closer to digital art in that it is a horizontal

371
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,900
technology and I think we will see its application everywhere.

372
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:45,500
So we have seen its application in PFPs.

373
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:52,940
We have seen its application in fine art, for denses or fine art.

374
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,300
I think we will see its application in gaming.

375
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:00,940
I think we will see its application in metaverse spaces.

376
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,980
I think we will see its application in consumer products.

377
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:17,700
Art Blocks has now created an API that allows people to make anything generative.

378
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,660
And so what do I mean by anything?

379
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,820
One example which I don't know if we will succeed in doing, I had told George about this

380
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:32,540
and if we can figure it out we will do this, is to make the core certificates at the end

381
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:38,940
generative so that everyone of course will have the same information on the mobile.

382
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,340
I assume a unique logo.

383
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:47,500
But there will also be some aspect of the core certificate that will be generative and will

384
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,580
be unique to each certificate holder.

385
00:36:52,580 --> 00:37:11,060
This ability to both mass craftsmanship, and mass personalization and also provably so.

386
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:20,060
I think it is very interesting.

387
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:27,100
I think it is going to make the world, and I have mentioned this to stuff right, it will

388
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,140
make the world a more beautiful place.

389
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:37,740
We used to have non-scalable craftspeople, 150 years ago, 300 years ago, pre-industrial

390
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:43,020
manufacturing, everything was unique because individuals were making it.

391
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:53,340
And then we have mostly gone through 150, 200 years of things being extremely standardized

392
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:01,740
and the reason they are standardized is because the demands of making things at high volume

393
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,780
at low prices push them to standardization.

394
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,980
That is fine, it is great, we have a higher quality of life because of it.

395
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,780
Cars are better and cheaper because they come in specific models and not each one is handcrafted.

396
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:22,300
So our chairs and tables and iPhones.

397
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:29,660
Now we have the beginning of a technology that for certainly digital goods and virtual

398
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:36,380
goods and goods in that part of our lives society economy that is going to be an increasing

399
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:47,580
part of that, better going to be more crafted, more individualized, more personalized, less

400
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,020
mass produced.

401
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:54,380
And then there is a very interesting question.

402
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:06,780
The overall thing is that in physical goods too, it is not clear to me how that might

403
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:12,940
happen but maybe with 3D printing, if you had a generative algorithm with 3D printing,

404
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:15,820
you could actually start seeing this in physical goods too.

405
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:25,260
But for sure in the short term, we will see this in digital goods and virtual goods and

406
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,260
NFTs and in anything in the kind of metaverse environment.

407
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:36,940
Now let's go through a few kind of background slides that I think people should probably

408
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:41,820
know for in the NFT generative world.

409
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:55,540
So the autoglyphs are largely believed to be the first on-chain generative art NFTs.

410
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:03,820
Amazingly or maybe not amazingly, they were made by the larval apps team which is the same

411
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,060
team that made the crypto punks.

412
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:11,100
And it's both amazing that they did the punks and they did autoglyphs, it's also not amazing

413
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
because both of them were generative.

414
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,540
So it's the same thought process.

415
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,340
What is very interesting about the Autoglyphs is that all the instructions to make them

416
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,180
are 100% on-chain.

417
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,620
So you can just have the token.

418
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:35,700
If you have the token, you know how to draw the Autoglyph represented by that token.

419
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:45,700
There was then a kind of break of year, year and a half when there wasn't a ton of activity

420
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,860
in generative art and then on-chain generative art.

421
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:58,420
And then there was with the chromisquivals and construction token and you know, art blocks

422
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:10,460
and the platform kickstarted a huge explosion in generative art collections.

423
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:18,780
Some very high percentage of the market cap of generative art is actually Art Blocks collections.

424
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,540
Someone the 80% range.

425
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:28,980
There were 100 collections were created on the platform that Erick Cakderon created and

426
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,980
it was the hub of this activity.

427
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:36,260
It still is though what is happening now and it's natural and healthy, more platforms

428
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,260
are emerging.

429
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,500
And so I think that percentage will obviously go down over time.

430
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:50,860
But between for those and this part of the business is very straightforward for those

431
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
who are in this space.

432
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,620
Autoglyphs and then Art Blocks.

433
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:02,460
I think were very important foundational steps in on-chain generative art.

434
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:20,380
Let's talk a little bit about on-chain enes and what we mean when it's on-chain.

435
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,380
What we mean when it's on-chain.

436
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:33,580
We call it on-chain sure.

437
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:39,060
So let's work through this chart.

438
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:49,300
Level three, zero dependencies means that everything you need to regenerate the piece

439
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,540
isn't the token itself.

440
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:59,500
And so you don't need anything from anyone's server.

441
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:06,580
You don't need anything even from decentralized storage like IPFS or ARLiv.

442
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:14,180
The only condition for the artwork surviving is the block chain that you have used.

443
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:22,020
The Ethereum and there's a platform called FXASH on, that is also popular for generative

444
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:25,340
art, is that that blockchain survives.

445
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:34,620
If that blockchain survives, within the token itself, you have everything you need to do

446
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:42,300
to recreate the artwork.

447
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,700
Level two, there's one dependency and I put in four zeroes.

448
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:57,300
It's not only some artists are now uploading the libraries into the project, so I want

449
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:01,420
to dig into that a little bit more because I think there might be some projects that

450
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,980
are art blocks and are level three.

451
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,780
I'm not 100% sure about this, so I need to double check this.

452
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:21,980
There is, the code is, the art blocks project is on the blockchain and then there are run

453
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,860
edges into libraries, but I do believe for some new projects libraries are also on chain,

454
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,460
so the whole piece is on chain.

455
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:35,220
So how to dig into this with Snwofro and we might update the slide a little bit.

456
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:39,860
Another interesting thing about Art Blocks projects is their resolution independent.

457
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:47,620
And this is a condition for minting on the platform and really smart future proofing.

458
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:56,060
They should work the same way on today's screens of 4K, but also in 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K,

459
00:44:56,060 --> 00:45:01,940
I don't know who we'll end up to over time, but however high resolution the screen will

460
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,060
be in the future.

461
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:09,820
The piece should render natively in that resolution.

462
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:16,180
The code is resolution independent.

463
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:35,020
Yeah, level one, they are created randomly on blockchain, but the image itself is offline.

464
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,940
It must be a piece like this.

465
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,460
One interesting project called Cyber brokers then minted the images on chain as well

466
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:52,100
and it could cost them 70, 80 ETH, but so the images themselves are also on the blockchain.

467
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:56,540
And even here, there is an interesting question.

468
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:00,260
It's not necessarily the case that the developer can change.

469
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,700
The pointer, you could have a contract that is sent to the burn address or the owners,

470
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,380
the owners, the burn address, it points to our weave.

471
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:17,300
Then your certainty of provenance is Ethereum plus our weave surviving, right?

472
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,780
Truthing surviving.

473
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,380
It does not necessarily mean that you have to trust the developer.

474
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:27,340
It doesn't mean that there are two aspects that are needed.

475
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:34,220
So someone asked, why is this all happening?

476
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:43,020
Why are people doing this?

477
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,460
Well, it's because on a major blockchain, blockchain space is expensive.

478
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:58,940
So putting even a 2-3 megabyte photo, even in low gas times onto the theorem blockchain

479
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,780
will end up costing tens of thousands of dollars.

480
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:09,100
And this is, and larger files, you can't actually get them all on the block, you have

481
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,340
to break them up and it'll be hugely expensive.

482
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,740
It's effectively not viable.

483
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:19,420
And so this is another thing that I think pushes generative art, pushes certain uses

484
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:26,220
of NFTs to generative art because the instructions to draw something are generally much cheaper

485
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:30,300
to store the end image.

486
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:36,740
And so, now, I want to be clear, this is not necessarily a problem.

487
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:40,860
I collect photography, aren't you?

488
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:48,300
Photography is not generative, it's not stored on the blockchain.

489
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,220
What I would like to see, though, is that it's at least stored on a decentralized storage

490
00:47:52,220 --> 00:48:00,380
provider like IPFS or what I would feel uncomfortable with, or what I do feel uncomfortable with,

491
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:05,300
is projects where it's stored on someone's server.

492
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:13,020
The thought that the server will survive for years and decades, centuries is highly unlikely.

493
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:19,140
People will not be around to hold that together.

494
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,980
So this is Art Block's effort, as we've discussed it.

495
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:36,460
Now, as you've mentioned, Deafbeef, is fully audio-visual.

496
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:41,700
Art and shame is very, very famous pieces.

497
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:45,620
Some of them sold famously for an awful lot of money.

498
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:55,100
And again, it is extremely cutting-edge work before it's time.

499
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,300
I had shown some of this in my prior presentations.

500
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Refrigerator does incredible generative work.

501
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:08,940
This is Castle Butler that we had collected, which here, if not longform generative, it's

502
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:10,420
one piece.

503
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:17,860
But it is generative in that the artwork is being determined by data from environmental

504
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,860
sensors.

505
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:26,020
And so it is generative in the classic sense of gyrid of art, and then it is, of course,

506
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:27,020
represented in a blockchain.

507
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,940
But the data, in this case, is coming off-chain.

508
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,860
It's not coming from, you know, chain link or something like that.

509
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,380
It's actually coming from Barcelona, from the house itself.

510
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,180
And so it's a more classic approach to gyrid of art.

511
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:48,500
Hybrid, in a way, but represented ultimately by an NFT.

512
00:49:48,500 --> 00:50:02,060
And yeah, this is how it looks when represented physically in a very large screen.

513
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:09,460
I am going to stop here for today.

514
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:19,220
We have a huge, huge, huge number of guests in the generative art space that are coming

515
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:20,380
into the course.

516
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:27,420
So what I wanted to accomplish today is give you the frameworks.

517
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:33,500
So the frameworks of riots and interesting art movement riots and interesting medium

518
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,580
for generative art, how the space is largely generative.

519
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:51,340
What long-form means, what short-form means, what some key checkpoints were in the history

520
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,340
of generative art.

521
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:59,860
And then we're just going to have a huge number of interviews, one of one's panels

522
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,020
with generative artists.

523
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:08,060
I hope you can watch many or most of them because those get much more sophisticated

524
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:09,060
than this.

525
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:14,060
And again, this session is meant to give you the base level to enjoy and understand what

526
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:17,700
we're talking about in the other sessions.

527
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:23,180
And then, and I apologize for this, but I think practically there is no other way this

528
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,740
is going to happen, as will happen, I'm going to come back and update this presentation

529
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:35,620
a little bit, put some concepts in that come out through the interviews, and then distribute

530
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:42,700
the final one a few days down the line that reflects everything we've learned through

531
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,300
the next week, week and a half.

532
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:50,780
So again, I want to thank NooNeOx.

533
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:55,700
Quite frankly, this week, if it wasn't for him, they're willing to have their presentation

534
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,700
all.

535
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:03,180
So he did a great job, and I want to thank him.

536
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:10,620
But I do want to incorporate what we're going to learn from these amazing artists.

537
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,020
As with last week's presentation, we truly have an incredible set of generative artists

538
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,660
who are going to join the course.

539
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:22,780
And so the goal today was to give you the framework to understand those conversations

540
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:25,100
that are going to be a lot more sophisticated than these.

541
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:30,180
So the frameworks were that this appears to be a natural medium, NFTs appear to be a

542
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,580
natural medium for generative art.

543
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:40,580
And so what we're going to do is what long form and short form is, what were key points

544
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,580
in on-chain generative art, what does on-chain mean?

545
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:48,580
And so with these frameworks in place, we're going to talk to Snowfro, we're going to

546
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,580
talk to top generative artists.

547
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:55,580
And what I'd like to do is have you join as many of those discussions as possible, and

548
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:01,580
then incorporate learning from those discussions into this presentation, into the final version,

549
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:08,580
because it would be a shame not to do so, and then we'll distribute it, mint it, and so on.

550
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:21,580
How does an artist know that the pieces will fit together as a collection if they don't

551
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:26,580
know what will be minted?

552
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:33,580
The artist is running the algorithm before they take it onto the blockchain.

553
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:43,580
So someone creates an artist, someone creates an algorithm, they run into their computer,

554
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,580
they work on it, they see their outputs, they work on it some more, they see their outputs,

555
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:55,580
they work on it some more, and they have the ability to see what type of outputs it's

556
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:58,580
generated.

557
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:09,580
Once they're happy with the outputs, once they're happy with the outputs, then they take it

558
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:17,580
on blockchain, and then they'll discover what the specific outputs are that are created

559
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:23,580
at that point, but they'll have no idea which ones those will be.

560
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:29,580
The design space for some of these algorithms is utterly gigantic.

561
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:39,580
There is a project currently open called QQL, it's by Tyler Hobbs and Dendelite.

562
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:50,580
And here it's very interesting, the way the minting works is anyone can play with the different parts

563
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:59,580
of the algorithm, generate outputs, and decide if they want to mint their output.

564
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:06,580
So this collection is a thousand pieces like many other ones of these collections, that's

565
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:09,580
a thousand pieces.

566
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:18,580
But instead of the collector's kind of being conceptually a co-creator, because when they

567
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:25,580
press the mint button and what their computer is being important, here they are literally

568
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:33,580
actually co-creators, because they are looking through the output space and deciding which

569
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,580
ones they want to mint.

570
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:41,580
So in QQL they've sold mint passes, so there's a thousand mint passes, so the maximum number

571
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:50,580
of those which will happen, which will ever exist are a thousand, but the collectors will

572
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,580
get to pick them.

573
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:59,580
And this is super interesting because we have now, I even know the number is a few weeks

574
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:07,580
ago, collectors have created five million outputs or something and had minted about a hundred.

575
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:11,580
And I bet the number is more than ten million now and I think there's a hundred and thirty-nine

576
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:12,580
minted.

577
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:25,580
And so there will be this gigantic output space and from that output space only a thousand

578
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:32,580
of them will ever make it into finally being, finally being QQLs.

579
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:42,580
And I think it's a fascinating exercise, it's the URL is QQL.ART and I recommend it to

580
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:49,580
people as a way to learn, it is a great educational tool, I think I need to put it in the presentation.

581
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:57,580
If you go and create outputs on QQL to art and you can do this for free and change the different

582
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:01,580
parameters and see how the algorithm changes.

583
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:12,580
It's super super interesting and you get a sense of how these algorithms work and how

584
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:18,580
broad and deep they can be.

585
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:23,580
If the collector mints, where does the pay come from for the artist, how is the artist

586
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:24,580
paid?

587
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:30,580
Oh, that's very, that's very simple.

588
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:36,580
When you mint, you pay to mint, that payment goes to the artist or most of the ghost artist

589
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,580
there might be a platform fee.

590
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:45,580
Artists might also receive royalties on resale, but the royalties discussion is a big complicated

591
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,580
discussion.

592
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:53,580
The discussion that is for sure true is that they will receive the primary revenue, the

593
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:58,580
revenue when you mint, goes to the artist.

594
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:00,580
How does the artist control things?

595
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:05,580
The artist controls things by making the algorithm, but once the artist released the algorithm

596
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:08,580
on the blockchain, the artist no longer controls things.

597
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,580
That's what's super interesting about this.

598
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,580
The algorithm controls things.

599
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:18,580
Can we find patterns between the mintor and the algorithm using AI?

600
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:22,580
Now, I mean, it's not, you can see what the algorithm is.

601
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:25,580
The algorithm is not secret.

602
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:32,580
And you can see that what will the algorithm will produce if you put different values in

603
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,580
and the values that you put in create the different types of pieces.

604
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:43,580
And the pseudo randomness creates the values.

605
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:54,580
And for something like art blocks, the pseudo randomness is so sophisticated that you're

606
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,580
not going to be able to reverse engineer it.

607
00:58:56,580 --> 00:59:01,580
There's a couple of other questions effectively about reverse engineering algorithm.

608
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:08,580
You're just not going to be able to.

609
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,580
That's a short answer.

610
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,580
Next question.

611
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:16,580
Why are NFTs in most cases rectangular?

612
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,580
This is a great question.

613
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:22,580
I mean, the real question, why is, why is most NFT art rectangular?

614
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:28,580
And I think it's because that's what we're used to in the physical world.

615
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:36,580
And I think that will change over time because there's less, there are few reasons for them

616
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:44,580
to be rectangular in a digital world.

617
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,580
How to write different generative art projects?

618
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:54,580
Well, that's, I'm certainly not going to answer that question by ranking them.

619
00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:03,580
I think the general concepts that people look at are the output itself from an artistic perspective

620
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,580
is it's aesthetically interesting, is it technically challenging?

621
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:09,580
What type of output is produced?

622
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:17,580
A, B, are the pieces sufficiently different from each other?

623
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:20,580
And C, does it hold together as a collection?

624
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:25,580
Now you might say, well, this is very qualitative and yes, it's true.

625
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,580
Just mental.

626
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:28,580
This is how art works.

627
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:39,580
But there's broad consensus on which collections have resonated better with collectors.

628
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:42,580
And you can see that in the price of them.

629
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:50,580
So if you can, there are several hundred collections on art blocks as a useful comparative set.

630
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:56,580
And you can go to various tools, the unit team has a tool, and if the evaluation tool,

631
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:58,580
set them by market cap.

632
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:07,580
The ones with higher market cap are for the, are on the whole, um, valued.

633
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,580
Now, it's also early.

634
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,580
Some of these collections, three year old, a year and a half old, six months old.

635
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:27,580
I would expect that this will also change over time because this is what happens when, or over time, people,

636
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,580
societies have times that reflect on different art work.

637
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:37,580
And what might seem very important in 2022 might seem less important in 2022.

638
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,580
And vice versa.

639
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:46,580
So I wouldn't necessarily say those are today's consensus opinion will be forever tomorrow's consensus opinion.

640
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:48,580
Some pieces might be ahead of their time.

641
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,580
Very common with artists, right?

642
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,580
Like some, an artist are ahead of their time.

643
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:59,580
And then over time, people look back and say, my God, this artist was actually saying something very important.

644
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:02,580
And we're all be appreciating it now because they were ahead of us.

645
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:07,580
So I don't think of it as a static environment.

646
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:13,580
But I do think that if you want to ask a bunch of folks who collect gender-de-vark,

647
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,580
what are their ten favorite collections?

648
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:24,580
Most of them would probably give you five or six that are the same with each other and three or four that are different.

649
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:33,580
And that's fine, and that as the space gets bigger and we see more types of work and more diversity of work,

650
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,580
it'll be less like that.

651
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:42,580
There'll be some styles and some areas and some communities because I think gender-de-vark will be like digital art,

652
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:51,580
a horizontal aspect, not an aesthetic aspect, a technique, not an aesthetic.

653
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:57,580
Why is Decagon so affordable for you when compared to other generative art collections?

654
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:06,580
Decagon is an evolving generative art project run by Decagon, which is an art-unftea display platform.

655
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:14,580
The reason it's affordable slash free is it's being done by the firm to help promote Decagon.

656
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:28,580
So the business purpose there isn't to generate money from selling NFTs, but to create something interesting,

657
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:35,580
generative for the community of folks, the deck of community.

658
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,580
And it's the community token in a way.

659
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:44,580
But like we said before, how things can be generative in nature.

660
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:49,580
It's a generative token and it's designed to incent activity on the platform.

661
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:59,580
So the more things you do on Decagon, the more complicated your generative piece becomes.

662
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:04,580
What makes a great genre of artists do they have to be great coders?

663
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:09,580
I think it helps to be good.

664
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:17,580
There is this concept of depends on what I want to say, like partnership, positively, negatively ghost coding,

665
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,580
where the artist has the inspiration, someone else codes a genre of code.

666
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:26,580
But I think the first concept is more appropriate.

667
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:30,580
Many things can be done in partnership with other people.

668
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:35,580
I think some of the top generative artists are quite good at coding.

669
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:45,580
Maybe not 100% of them, but certain of them are very thought to be quite good at coding generative part.

670
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:50,580
It's certainly not a substitute for aesthetic sensibility.

671
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,580
You have to have both.

672
01:04:52,580 --> 01:04:55,580
But it's certainly not a minus.

673
01:04:55,580 --> 01:05:08,580
Certainly, if you have aesthetic sensibility, the better your coding skills are, the more likely you are to be able to implement your vision in code.

674
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:13,580
So I think it's helpful.

675
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:17,580
How will generative art evolve and be like in 2030?

676
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:24,580
I would put it backwards instead of saying how will generative art evolve?

677
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:27,580
There's going to be all types of things in generative art, right?

678
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:30,580
I can't predict all the artists in 2030.

679
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:45,580
I would say, just how you can say it is more like digital art, that generative art will, generative techniques will diffuse into everything.

680
01:05:45,580 --> 01:06:03,580
So what I'm comfortable is the case about 2030 is that the world, at large for sure the digital world and possibly parts of the physical world will have generative components.

681
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:12,580
Are there two questions together?

682
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:18,580
CC0 coding templates we can make derivatives with?

683
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Where do you find out about creating generative art algorithms?

684
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,580
So this is a very good question.

685
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:29,580
And I think we need this in the presentation.

686
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:32,580
George, if you can flag it to make sure we do add it to the presentation.

687
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:41,580
And I think we can actually, if it's a question we should ask our guests of one of the best tools for someone who wants to get involved in generative art.

688
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,580
So it's a really great question.

689
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:51,580
And I think we should have, we should have it in the reading as a specific slide that says, I'm interested in generative art.

690
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,580
I want to be a generative artist.

691
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,580
Experiment with being a generative artist.

692
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,580
What are the best places we go to first?

693
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:03,580
So I think that would be, that would be super neat.

694
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:20,580
A lot of derivatives are full of generative art, but more manual at the level where the original meme is the algorithm and the derivative artist is the manual input.

695
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:23,580
Now I want to think about that one.

696
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,580
I don't think about that one.

697
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:30,580
I think generative art means that there is a part of the art that is being created.

698
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:38,580
The actual algorithm is created that is procedurally created, that is created in an automated manner without human intervention.

699
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:42,580
That's what it means to me.

700
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:49,580
Okay.

701
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,580
I think we're pretty good on the questions.

702
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,580
So I think I'm going to wrap up here.

703
01:07:54,580 --> 01:08:00,580
Thank you everyone once again.
