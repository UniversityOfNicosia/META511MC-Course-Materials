1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,120
Okay.

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,080
Well welcome everyone.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:32,600
We are super excited today to have Snowfro Eric, the founder of Art Blocks with us.

4
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:40,040
Art Blocks, I think most people know this but for those who don't, is by far the dominant

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,720
platform or enabling technology for generative art.

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,480
So far a very large percentage of the important generative art projects were launched in

7
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:58,040
Art Blocks and the large amount of the market activity is on Art Blocks.

8
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,200
And so I'm very honored and excited that he's joining us today.

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,080
We're going to cover his background, how he got here in the first place.

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,360
Where the future of Art Blocks and generative art is going and then maybe touch upon some

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,760
broader industry topics and what they might mean.

12
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,640
So Eric first, thank you very much, and thank you, welcome to the course.

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Thanks for having me.

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,640
This is a little special.

15
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
This is my first metaverse course.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,160
So pretty excited to be here.

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's start with the easy question.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,400
How did you end up in the NFT field?

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,120
How did you end up founding Art Blocks?

20
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,680
Why did you find out what?

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,680
What's the point and purpose submission of Art Blocks?

22
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,280
Well, let's start with NFT.

23
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,560
So in 2017, I got really excited about Ethereum early, like January 2017, early in the year

24
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,880
and started tinkering with smart contracts and really just like, you know, I was excited

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
about Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,440
But when I discovered the concept of a smart contract, it really clicked.

27
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,000
And it felt like honestly, I feel like the smart contract is the killer app of blockchain

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
technology.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,880
It's just so technical that it may not be what the mainstream sees that as.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:25,400
But I tinkered, wrote some smart contracts, tried to, like everybody else figure out how

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,280
to integrate technology into their regular life.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,920
I was in charge of a ceramic tile-importing business.

33
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,600
So couldn't be less technical, but always looking for like, exploring for ways of like,

34
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,160
you know, finding the technology living in the real world.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,160
During that time, I saw a lot of organizations release projects in the NFT space, I mean,

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,960
sorry, in the crypto space.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,520
I oftentimes found them to be a square peg around hole, just, you know, have meetings

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,800
with people and it was just like, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.

39
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,960
And like, how am I going to use this?

40
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
What am I going to do with it?

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,720
And I was actually really kind of put off by just like the rush towards utilizing the

42
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,680
technology without thinking about how actual use case would be with the product market.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,920
It would be the distribution mechanisms, et cetera.

44
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:24,440
Fast forward to June 2017, I was on Reddit and I saw a link for the CryptoPunks project.

45
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,160
Clicked it, read it, read all the information that was created and put together by larval

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,200
labs and just like old moment for me, it was like, yeah, this is, this is, this is awesome.

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,080
First of all, it was a generative art project, a 10,000 character generative art project,

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,440
which, you know, I've always been really big in the generative art.

49
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:51,560
And a project that to me was demonstrating in a very simple decentralized manner, the

50
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:59,360
beauty of the technology, the simplicity and the power of being able to prove ownership

51
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,560
of a digital asset.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,680
So I claimed a bunch of CryptoPunks, a lot of them were zombies, 34 to be exact.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,840
And I then dove right in and never looked back.

54
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,920
It was very slow at the beginning in terms of people in the space, spent the next few

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,120
years onboarding anybody that was interested in hearing about the technology, both IRL

56
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,360
and in the CryptoPunks Discord, which was oftentimes a very slow place and oftentimes

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,880
a pretty exciting place.

58
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,560
All the while continuing a practice of creating art with code, something that I had started

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,960
about six, seven years prior to that, tinkering with projection mapping and generating visual

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,640
outputs with, with code.

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:05:02,080
And finally, in 2020, after Art Blocks version one, two and three, just kind of feeling like

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,260
I had an idea that wasn't able to really kind of put into action, I launched Art Blocks

63
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,120
formally is what you see it today, which is the fourth iteration of Art Blocks conceptually

64
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,000
as a platform intending to host, hopefully, the best generative art from the best generative

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,480
artists in the world, using a technology that in my opinion demonstrates the power of watching

66
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:30,840
an FT, which is a distribution mechanism for individualized outputs, the one of one of

67
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,600
acts concept in a way that really would have been very difficult time consuming in the past

68
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
for an artist.

69
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:46,920
And to kind of put it all in a box, a generative artist prior to Art Blocks would have created

70
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:55,040
an algorithm, produced visual outputs from that algorithm, save them on their hard drive

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,120
and pre-block change just displayed them, post them on Instagram, maybe work with the

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,400
gallery, printed them, had exhibitions, et cetera.

73
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:13,960
Post NFTs would save them on their hard drive, tokenize them, and then list them on a marketplace.

74
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,520
And what Art Blocks did is actually cut those three steps out of the middle and make it

75
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,800
to where the algorithmic artist would just upload the algorithm to the blockchain.

76
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,600
And when the collector came to make a purchase, they would be purchasing a new iteration,

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,960
a new output of that algorithm.

78
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,280
And it would happen on demand, on the fly, the artist actually doesn't know exactly what's

79
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,880
going to come out of the mentor, but has highly curated their algorithm in advance.

80
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,400
And the collector, it becomes the creator, the one that actually makes the artwork happen.

81
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,120
And the artwork is immediately and automatically deposited into their wallet.

82
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,760
The product market fit is not what I expected.

83
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,880
This is a hobby, and this was a hobby, and just literally like a hugely nerdy hobby that

84
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,840
I thought had a tiny little niche audience.

85
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:16,160
But the product market fit has demonstrated a desire, I think, for humans to be individuals

86
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,160
and to display and collect things that are unique to them, and the technology enables

87
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
that to happen in a way that could happen before.

88
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,200
Can you spend a couple of minutes on exactly how the process works?

89
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,000
Because I think some people might not understand what it means, and if T is on chain, that

90
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,520
the algorithm is on chain, it is created at the time of the minting.

91
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,160
And I say this, not even new people to the space actually, even people who are not new

92
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,800
to the space, often don't understand exactly how it works.

93
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,880
You may have spent two minutes on that.

94
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Yeah.

95
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,880
I was recently on a panel with a very smart man that was talking about this concept of

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,600
the stores of value.

97
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,760
And there's a lot of things in the NFT space that can act as a store of value, but one

98
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,440
thing that makes things a store of value is this sovereign bearer asset concept, right?

99
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:22,040
Where there's no external influences in your ability to, A, prove ownership, and B, experience

100
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,280
the artwork in a future.

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,080
And so one of the things that's really interesting about our box is that we are very strict with

102
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,680
artists and require them to upload algorithmic art.

103
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,840
This is computer-generated art.

104
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,400
They upload the code that generates the art.

105
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,080
So blockchain storage is very expensive, prohibitively expensive.

106
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:54,560
It's impossible to store an image on the blockchain without spending a lot of money on gas.

107
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:07,560
And the idea here is that the artwork stored on chain could generate a one megabyte image

108
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
or a 1000 megabyte image, depending on the resolution at which the image was displayed

109
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
was really intriguing to me.

110
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,320
Like, if the limitation of the blockchain is storage, meaning that we can't really store

111
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,480
high-resolution files on it, but if we want art to persist because it's stored on blockchain

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:30,080
technology, to me the solution was storing the root of it, the algorithm of it on the

113
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
blockchain.

114
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,240
And that algorithm, something that we're very strict with artists to make it what we call

115
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,640
resolution agnostic, meaning that it can be displayed and will display identically at

116
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:48,320
any resolution that computer are capable of displaying, felt incredibly compelling as

117
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
a way of utilizing the medium.

118
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,120
And so, you know, people have recently referred to this as like the most true form of internet

119
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,960
art or utilizing internet technology or digital technology to create art simply because it

120
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,320
is meant to stand a test of time.

121
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:11,520
And it stands a test of time from a resolution perspective, which we kind of didn't expect

122
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,160
to need until later, maybe four or five years down the road, I figure maybe that they would

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,680
release some new resolution television that would really demonstrate the power of the

124
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,080
resolution agnosticism of an artworks artwork.

125
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,520
Yet, this year, during a conference, there was an installation that we got to display

126
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:33,800
artworks, artworks on a three-story screen at the Samsung headquarters in New York.

127
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,200
And we were able to generate the artwork for a three-story screen at the full resolution

128
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,240
that that screen could provide.

129
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,320
And no matter what you do with any artwork that's stored as a JPEG or a GIF, you cannot.

130
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,840
You either have to upsample, digitally up sample that artwork, or you have to display

131
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,800
it at a smaller size than what the screen is capable of doing.

132
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,840
And there's something very powerful about something where all of the information required

133
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,480
to recreate that algorithm is stored on chain.

134
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,680
We used to say most of the information, but now we're seeing other community members upload,

135
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,840
even the libraries like P5JS and 3JS that we use to generate these outputs are now also

136
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,840
being stored on chain.

137
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,320
So all of the information necessary to restore this artwork is stored on chain and it's able

138
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,560
to be produced at any resolution.

139
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,800
And it's a sovereign bare asset where nobody is deciding or making decisions as to how

140
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,360
you utilize the NFT.

141
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,760
As long as you own that digital asset, as long as you own that NFT, you own the rights

142
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
that are conveyed by the artist, depending on the license that they provided, generally

143
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,800
it's either a Creative Commons for license, the NFT license, or even a Creative Commons

144
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,200
zero license, the CC0 license.

145
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,560
And then you are at your leisure to how you utilize that, how you control, how you store

146
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,120
that digital asset, knowing that that digital asset will persist as long as the blockchain

147
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,120
persists.

148
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,760
And that's what the future looks like, but given the transparency and the beauty of blockchain

149
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,920
technology, I think that blockchain technology will last for a long time.

150
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,840
And we're really excited about what that looks like, where these assets that were created

151
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:24,480
in 2020, 2021, 2022, maybe in the year 2075 are still being able to be reproduced at full

152
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,400
scale, full resolution.

153
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:33,520
And you are still the owner of that asset in a way that's provable.

154
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,560
It's revolutionary to be able to prove ownership of something digital, and then to then take

155
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,080
it further and be able to reproduce that digital thing at any resolution, or within any environment

156
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,600
is something that I think is truly special.

157
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:56,720
And has a lot to do with why there's so much value placed on these artworks.

158
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,240
And the point is that when someone mints at the time that they're minting, there is

159
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,640
a random aspect that has to do with the time that they press the button, right?

160
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,800
And this is how somehow there are a lot of you that are in a way a co-creator, in a limited

161
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:23,600
sense perhaps, but the moment that they chose to click, determine what the work looked like,

162
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,600
right?

163
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,480
And then there is this concept of entropy, which is a concept of the amount of randomness,

164
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,720
or where the source of randomness comes from.

165
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,240
And on the blockchain, there's no pure randomness.

166
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,680
It's pseudo-randomness, which means that there's always a deterministic nature of watching

167
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,920
technology.

168
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,640
But we utilize a bunch of fun little tips and tricks to make it more complex, borderline,

169
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,280
or I would, you should never say impossible, but very, very difficult for someone to game

170
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,080
the determinism of an Art Blocks piece.

171
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,400
And what's beautiful about it is, you know, sometimes say, oh, if I would have minted

172
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,480
number 25, I would have gotten something nicer or something different.

173
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:12,120
The reality is that every little component from the balance of the USDC smart contract

174
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:19,200
to the block ID and transaction hash changes and shapes the entropy of what went into the

175
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:26,560
piece, and so every mint is truly uncontrolled by the user, or mostly uncontrolled by the

176
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,480
user and random.

177
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:36,560
And that forces the artists to really craft and curate an algorithm where they are putting

178
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,680
their stamp of approval on every single output that's going to come out of that, because

179
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,000
they need neither.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,560
They know the collector has control over what they're actually going to get in the end.

181
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:54,120
Right, so what you're saying is, if I minted number 26, and I said, oh, man, 25 is beautiful,

182
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,600
I wish I had just clicked earlier.

183
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,640
If I had clicked earlier, the likelihood that I would have gotten 25 is infinitesimally

184
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,320
small because unless it was the exact same millisecond or milliseconds that the previous

185
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,840
person would click 25, 25 would have been different.

186
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,080
Even that, but even the fact that your wallet address is different.

187
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,960
So all of these things come into play into the entropy, and our blocks has evolved significantly

188
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,760
the pseudo random number generator or the pseudo random generator that we're using.

189
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,440
So even with the new smart contracts, it's even different from that.

190
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,080
But ideally, there was enough entropy in there to where, you know, and this could be a tangent,

191
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,160
so maybe we don't go to you window, but oftentimes people are like, oh, I want my birthday, or

192
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,720
I want my DNA to be inside of an artwork.

193
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,160
My response is that, you know, if my DNA generates something green and your DNA generates something

194
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:48,760
yellow, and I know that my DNA generated that green one because it's my DNA, sure.

195
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,320
But if my DNA generated something and yours generated something different, and we couldn't

196
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,680
tell the difference between who generated who's, then really, it doesn't really matter what

197
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:00,320
the source of entropy is as long as it's pseudo random or random.

198
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:09,640
And it doesn't, I don't know that people actually want to have too much of a say in what the

199
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
output is.

200
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:17,720
I think, at least for me, I like being able to control fully, well, limitedly because

201
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,840
it's pseudo random, but be able to craft what the algorithm produces.

202
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,940
And oftentimes, you know, we see people kind of go down this path, especially with our

203
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,520
boxes, we kind of expand people are like, hey, can I put my birthday or my wallet address

204
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,960
or my DNA, make that be the source of random for the piece.

205
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,480
And I think it's actually fun and intriguing, but the result would be not palpable.

206
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,200
And if the results not palpable, then it's an unnecessary intrusion into the block, the

207
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,240
air gapped nature of the blockchain.

208
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,000
And that's something that kind of goes back to like the art is on chain.

209
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,160
And then also the generation of the seed is on chain, and therefore everything is air

210
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,600
gapped and free from human meddling, for the most part, using this technology and the

211
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,600
provenance there.

212
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:10,760
I mean, obviously the NFT technology provides some crazy provenance in terms of ownership

213
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:17,560
history and, you know, some financial information, but this added provenance of everything generated,

214
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,840
stored on chain in an air gapped fashion, I think further enhances the durability of

215
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:32,160
these things that people are looking at as not just like beautiful art and cultural items

216
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,120
now, but also stores a value for the future.

217
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,720
Makes perfect sense.

218
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:46,360
Any touch upon something else you said, a common way people describe these types of

219
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,440
collections is one of one of X that each one's unique, but they're part of a broader whole

220
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,760
Tyler Hobbes calls them long form generative collections.

221
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:05,840
And I think there's at least one point of view that this really is the natural medium

222
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,480
for generative art.

223
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:15,400
It's found its home because you can let everyone can see the algorithm operating at the same

224
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
time.

225
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
What's your view on this?

226
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,360
Yeah, this goes in so many levels.

227
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,920
I mean, if you just take a step back to one of one, right?

228
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,640
I'm sorry, one of X.

229
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,760
So in the physical world, you trust a photographer to do an addition of 10, but you don't know

230
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,760
how many.

231
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,760
I mean, we need to make sure that we can trust artists just institutionally, like down to

232
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,920
the roots, we need to be in a position to trust artists.

233
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I live here in Houston and I love that the contemporary art museum here in Houston has

234
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,080
this slogan that says, trust artist period, right?

235
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,240
So we need to trust artists, but there's something really beautiful about NFT technology where

236
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,840
if it's a one of X, if it's a one of 10, it's demonstrable.

237
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:08,000
The artist is publicly accepting a capped limitation for that addition.

238
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,760
Sure, they could go mint the same art on another platform, but it would be traceable

239
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,440
and you would still be able to get back to what the original was.

240
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,720
Sure, they can go print an addition of 10 and sign 10 additions and call those one of

241
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,800
10, two of 10, three of 10.

242
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,400
But ultimately, if we trust the artist to like act in their best interest and within

243
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,000
the cultural norm that the art profession kind of provides, there's an opportunity for

244
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,640
the artists to demonstrably choose an addition size.

245
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:47,600
Now, an addition size of 100 of the same output is perfectly suitable for photography, 3D

246
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,480
art, stuff made on procreate, I mean, things that are made with the hand.

247
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:59,800
But in an increasingly digital world, we are drawn to a digital representation that distinguishes

248
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,520
us from other people.

249
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,920
And so while there's nothing technically wrong with making a PFP or an avatar out of

250
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,080
an addition of 100 where it's like everybody can potentially have that, 100 people can

251
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,800
have that same avatar.

252
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:18,280
The internet has trained us to try to be as individualistic as we are in real life.

253
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,440
And it's impossible.

254
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,840
It's physically impossible.

255
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,840
I could be called out for saying things that are impossible.

256
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,680
So maybe it's very, very, very improbable that there would be two humans with the same

257
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:33,960
air count and facial structure, I mean, literally identical humans.

258
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,240
And I think that kind of translates well into the digital space.

259
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,040
The concept of one of one of X is that the larval labs guys could not have, I mean, technically

260
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:51,520
you could have created 10,000 crypto punks individually by placing pixels.

261
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,440
Like that would not have been a good use of time, especially knowing the power of what

262
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,200
the technology can provide.

263
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
But what they did is they wrote an algorithm that created 10,000 pixels and 10,000, I mean,

264
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,480
10 characters with 24 inch by 24 pixel by 24 pixel characters.

265
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,040
And when they first came out, it felt like it was too many, especially in the typical

266
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:19,280
norm of art, like 10,000 works of art in one fell swoop is a lot.

267
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,360
It felt like a lot.

268
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,800
There was really a few hundred people maybe participating actively in the space in the

269
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,680
first couple of years after the release of the CryptoPugs project.

270
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,520
But what we've learned is that as, forget about the speculation, the FOMO and all the

271
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:41,880
money involved, like as this technology finds a foothold in our daily lives of transparency.

272
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,480
And you know, my daily life is very different than the majority of humans because I use

273
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,840
Metamask on a daily basis to authenticate who I am.

274
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,280
So I understand we're not there yet in the mainstream.

275
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,680
But as this technology has kind of taken a foothold, we realize that 10,000 is nothing.

276
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,160
10,000 is very, very, very few.

277
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,040
And that's demonstrated by the value, the kind of insane value that CryptoPunks and

278
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,000
Board Apes have.

279
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,440
And that value is what we are assigning as humans to being individuals.

280
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,840
Because I don't believe that the value of 10,000 CryptoPunks would be what it is today

281
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:22,920
if it was 10,000 of the same CryptoPunk as in addition of 10,000 or even the same 100

282
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,720
editions of 100, the value would not be what it is today.

283
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,360
The value is what it is today because of a sense of individuality.

284
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,600
If I'm flicking through Twitter, I see your avatar, your PFP way before I see your name

285
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,840
and I know who you are.

286
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,720
Unless it's like a funk or, oh, actually that's facing the other direction or maybe like a

287
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,560
B1 punk, but that has a different background.

288
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,760
Like, there's something really special in the digital world about the individuality.

289
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,480
And this goes back to this product, market fit, and I'm not trying to make art sound

290
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,640
like a product and collect or sound like a market.

291
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,240
But the distribution mechanism for an artist to create something with a demonstrable addition

292
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,880
size in a large addition without intermediary steps and all the information used to recreate

293
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:10,960
that artwork is on chain.

294
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,560
It's just unprecedented stuff to be able to put it together like that.

295
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,400
And I definitely want to reiterate that that is not when I launched ArtBlox, like I was

296
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,360
excited about the one of one of X concept.

297
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,760
I was excited about art being on chain, but I did not fully understand the product market

298
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,920
fit, the distribution mechanism and the value proposition that this would have beyond the

299
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,120
small niche generative art world.

300
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,200
I literally saw this as a cool tool for generative artists, did not fully embrace or understand

301
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,520
this product market fit until a couple of months into it when I started to realize just

302
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,840
like how powerful the sense of community was around being a the creator of an artwork

303
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,880
alongside the artist, the one that created the piece and then the sharing of it within

304
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,880
a community of people with the artist president.

305
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,800
Yeah, I still to this day kind of like and shocked at how it exploded, but also totally

306
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,680
understand from a human perspective why it is exploded.

307
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:19,200
And so one of one of X continues to be something that we pursue.

308
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,840
I often say that the lowest friction use case of one of one of X is pixels on a screen

309
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:30,280
with demonstrated a wonderful kind of community reception to the pixels on a screen being

310
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,520
artwork that just lives in the digital space.

311
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,440
And now we're really excited and earlier you asked, you know, what does the feature

312
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,920
of ArtBlox look like?

313
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,160
I don't think this ends at pixels on a screen.

314
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:45,600
I do think that this permeates into the real world.

315
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,600
And while I'm not fully in tune or understand like what the implications are of physical

316
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,840
and digital goods that are meaningfully connected, it makes me.

317
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,240
It just feels like an unresolved thing in my gut.

318
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,600
The idea of like an ephemeral physical object that's derived from a digital object that

319
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,520
you are the sole and provable owner of is something that I find fascinating and something that

320
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,160
I really look forward to exploring beyond the pixels on a screen concept.

321
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,240
And I really think that's where ArtBlox is going to be hopefully, you know, shepherding

322
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:30,080
the world into enabling their audiences to own both digital and physical one of one of

323
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:37,320
X's as opposed to like one copies of the same exact object when applicable.

324
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,240
Obviously like we may not need spatulas that are one of one of X's.

325
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,840
But yeah, in a future where I can mint a car and the car is unique to me for whatever reason.

326
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,360
Yeah, I would look forward to that.

327
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,280
And maybe that's 50 years down the road.

328
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,960
I don't know, but I'd be excited about it.

329
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,640
You had mentioned something at the beginning.

330
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,200
It's very minor, but I want to flag it because it's the same way I think about the space.

331
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,920
You had said the puncture generative.

332
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,560
In my view is that most PFP collections, the way they're done, are also generative.

333
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:13,640
And so if you think about the PFP's end-generative art, it means the vast majority of NFT spaces

334
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,360
as it is today is in fact generative.

335
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,360
Is that right?

336
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
Yes, absolutely.

337
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:26,680
Yeah, it's all, I mean, unless someone's drawing each individual one, yeah, it's by definition

338
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
generative.

339
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:37,680
I think it's further confirmation that generative might have found its native medium with NFTs.

340
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:45,640
I think that there's a chance that if crypto punks were not generative, I may not have

341
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,800
claimed them because it was a pain in the ass back then to claim an NFT.

342
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,240
There was no metamasker, I didn't know about it, and I'd sink my Ethereum wallet, etc.

343
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,920
And what caught my eye was the fact that it was generative and the fact that something

344
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,640
generative was made accessible in this way.

345
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:17,080
And people always say like larva labs is essentially instituted a 10k number for a PFP.

346
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,080
It felt like a lot.

347
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:25,360
A lot that came after that came from that concept of a generative thing, crypto kitties,

348
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,880
also generative.

349
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,280
And then everything that came after that, that was minted on demand was in fact generative,

350
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,680
whether there was a reveal process afterwards or not, it was still a generative piece.

351
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,080
Okay, this is an amazing background.

352
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,880
Let's talk about the next steps in Art Blocks.

353
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,920
And let's start again with some basics, Art Blocks used to have three collection types,

354
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,840
curated, playground and factory.

355
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,680
Now there's a different set, there's collaborations, there's also an API.

356
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
How was it before?

357
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
How was it now?

358
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:03,760
What are the differences in the types of collections?

359
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,280
Why did you make the change?

360
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,920
Why did the series end?

361
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:10,000
And so I'd love to hear about that.

362
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,240
Well, first of all, I made collections initially when it was just me.

363
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,880
And then Jeff Davis was working alongside me actually contract basis initially just because

364
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,240
he was such a wonderful person to work with and like so involved early on.

365
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,120
But when I was still kind of making all the decisions for the most part, I started getting

366
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,240
the sense of dread of being the naysayer.

367
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,480
And I am generally someone that is a very inclusive person.

368
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,840
I don't like to leave people out.

369
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,080
I don't like to say no to people generally, although I've had to say that more and more

370
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,080
in.

371
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:54,960
But then at the same time, before Art Blocks launched, I got very little traction.

372
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,240
Some of the best artists in the world that I've since launched on Art Blocks, like fully

373
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,400
ignored tweet messages and direct messages, Reddit messages when I reached out in 2018,

374
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,960
2019, 2020 to talk about Art Blocks.

375
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,680
And I totally understand why it was a shit show of information that I would just like

376
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,200
regurgitate to them and be like, yeah, this is crazy.

377
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,240
Or they just went on fire.

378
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,760
In the first few weeks of Art Blocks, everything except for the Chromium School sold out immediately.

379
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,640
And I think it peaked a lot of artists' interest and oftentimes with things that make people

380
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,520
money, there are people that make things because they're artists and they love it and they're

381
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,400
excited about sharing.

382
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:41,240
And then there's people that make things because they can and because they can make money.

383
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,760
And I did not feel that I was the right person to mean making those decisions.

384
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,760
I didn't have time.

385
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,440
First of all, I was not sleeping.

386
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,960
And so I was making those decisions on behalf of the platform for artists that I don't know

387
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,320
and I didn't know and I didn't have time to research.

388
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:05,440
And so the first thing I did was create this territorial board to potentially say no to

389
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,360
art.

390
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,720
Very little art initially was said no to.

391
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,720
And I still wanted Art Blocks to be a fully open platform.

392
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,040
So I still wanted a place for people to release art.

393
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,960
I just wanted to celebrate the best art.

394
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,440
And so I added a couple categories.

395
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,440
First of all, playground because we had some very prolific artists that were wanting to

396
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,560
release more work that had already released on Art Blocks.

397
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:37,400
And I didn't want to call it curated because I wanted there to be like a little pause just

398
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,920
to give some breathing room.

399
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,320
And then what we called the factory which was originally intended to be the open platform

400
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,840
for anybody that can code a pixel onto a screen to code a pixel onto a screen.

401
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:55,520
And that also served as a fall back for as we were getting more and more artists.

402
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,080
I mean within a couple of weeks of opening an artist application, we had 300 artists apply.

403
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,240
It was just like an impossibility to keep up with stuff.

404
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,600
It gave us a bucket to put art that we were excited or wanted to give people a shot at

405
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,680
like producing art in this way but did not want it to be feet.

406
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,560
Like it wasn't at the level of the art that was coming that was to be featured in the

407
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
curated section.

408
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:24,080
So then after a year and a half, there was a shift in curation where we added a second

409
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,360
curation process which is a screening process internally.

410
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,560
And from feedback from some of the some of the really strong artists on the Art Blocks

411
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,600
website and this idea that we wanted to make sure that all of the artwork on our box, not

412
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:45,240
just curated, perpetuated the value of effort that artists put into their work.

413
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,640
We started screening a significant percentage of artworks and lost the ability to kind of

414
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,480
host everybody's art on our blocks.

415
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,440
And it was really kind of sad for me because I really was really excited about the open

416
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,160
democratized nature of the platform.

417
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,720
But also when I launched Art Box, I didn't realize that we would have such incredibly

418
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,960
powerful and significant artwork released on the platform.

419
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,000
You know, given that I'm a huge fan of generative art and I'm a huge fan of these artists,

420
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,840
like for years I had followed these artists like way before Art Box existed and like the

421
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,200
best thing that I could do that we could do as a platform in service of those artists

422
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,440
was to make sure that all of the art on the platform was of a certain level of quality.

423
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,880
So what happened is we started accepting only about 15% of the artworks that were submitted

424
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,320
to Art Box.

425
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,880
But because of the perception of what happened and last year there was a kind of a mad rush

426
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,840
to Art Box, we couldn't keep anything live on the platform.

427
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,120
Everything would sell out immediately, crazy prices.

428
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:54,440
I mean, the FOMO and speculation was real and it was significant and it was really,

429
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,080
I think it was a step back for Art Box and for generative art.

430
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,800
Like I think it was detrimental to the long term meaning of this type of art.

431
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:09,600
In other words, I would very much have preferred this kind of slope than this kind of slope

432
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,040
because if you're very crypto enough, you know that everything goes up, comes down.

433
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:21,440
We started getting responses from artists that were screened but not curated and say

434
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,240
things like, well, I don't want to be released on the factory.

435
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,360
I don't want to be released in like the second class, whatever thing.

436
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,600
And A, I would take it way more personally than I should because a lot of my favorite

437
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
artworks are in the factory.

438
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,960
And factory, a lot of the artwork is incredible.

439
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,040
It just wasn't pushing boundaries.

440
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,240
And there's a lot of really good examples of things that are in the factory that had

441
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,320
they been released six months earlier, they would have absolutely been curated.

442
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,520
But if you see the progression of like pushing the boundaries of dinner to art and the curated

443
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,480
section, you realize that like it could be a brilliant work within the art and an artist

444
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,040
could have worked on it for years, months, whatever.

445
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,680
And it still wasn't pushing a boundary for the medium.

446
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,040
And so they wouldn't want to release it on Art Box and so then we'd see the artwork release

447
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
on other platforms.

448
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:18,480
And I'd be like, man, 15% acceptance rate is pretty elite, in my opinion, especially

449
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,040
given that there's not a huge number of generative artists in the world.

450
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,840
And it hurt.

451
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,040
Like it hurt us, the team, to see that happen.

452
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,560
It was like demoralizing.

453
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,240
And to know that we might have like screened an artist in and they were like they were

454
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,320
dissatisfied with like the experience.

455
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,520
And what it made us go back to think about is like, okay, is the word factory a turnoff,

456
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
right?

457
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,760
Like originally it was meant to be a factory.

458
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,720
This is just anybody that can code can put art on the platform.

459
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,240
But over time it was no longer just churning out meaning to churn out work or let anybody

460
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,360
release.

461
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,880
And so we started to second guess the word factory.

462
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:03,120
We also realized that the curated that the playground badge and to explain playground

463
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,280
or what we call heritage playground now was any work that was released.

464
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,880
By an artist that had previously been curated because they had like a previous they had

465
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
like a freeze period.

466
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,880
They couldn't release new period of work six months or they couldn't submit to curation,

467
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,040
but they could still have really great artwork.

468
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,960
I think a lot of the work in the playground is and could very well be curated.

469
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,200
I think for example, Meridian by Matt Deloria is one of my favorite pieces on our box period.

470
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,440
And it's a playground piece, right?

471
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,880
But to me that easily could have been a curated piece.

472
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:40,680
It came sooner after his original release that it wasn't eligible to be curated.

473
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,840
But what we're realizing is that playground actually became a designation for artists

474
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,880
that had been previously curated more than a category in and of itself.

475
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,920
And I also got a lot of communication as I, you know, I spent the year this year and

476
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,280
last year essentially integrated in intermingling with both the traditional art world and the

477
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,360
entity space and a lot of people would mention that they're confused even after someone explaining

478
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,200
to them what the different categories were.

479
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,560
They still felt confusion and uncertainty.

480
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,160
And so the amazing team that I get to work with every single day at our box put our brains

481
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,600
together and simplified it.

482
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:23,400
And we really just, you know, changing the name from factory to presents is basically

483
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:31,440
saying our blocks is presenting this work as a wonderful example of generative art.

484
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,600
And the concept of playground is shifted to A, we have the heritage playground collection.

485
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,360
But E, a playground project is something that that tag just means that that artists have

486
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
been previously curated.

487
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:47,840
And I do think that artists should be recognized for having achieved curation at some point

488
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,320
or a curated project at some point in the process.

489
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,120
So now we have those two categories curated.

490
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,440
We also removed the designation for the series.

491
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,680
In other words, we had series designations every quarter, it would be a new series.

492
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
And the reason I did this is I did this for a lot of reasons.

493
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,440
A, as a collector, I really always enjoyed collecting comic cards by series.

494
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,560
Literally Marvel series one, series two and series three is the original reason the card

495
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,200
collecting is the original kind of idea of coming up with a series.

496
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,160
And then the series though became the other reason for the series was that somebody that

497
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,040
may not be able to collect all curated Art Blocks pieces would be able to say and feel

498
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,320
the satisfaction of having collected all of series one.

499
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
So it was a compartmentalization.

500
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:44,000
It was a way of enabling people to participate and have a set, something that I've always

501
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,240
been drawn to is full sets, having a set of something and being able to say, look at my

502
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,480
series three sets, even if they could not participate in all of them.

503
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,160
What happened though is we had a very early project called elevated deconstructions, which

504
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:03,080
gosh, the simplicity of that project is so special and also one of my favorite projects

505
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,280
in Art Blocks.

506
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,200
It was an addition of 200 and it demonstrated a bottleneck in collectability.

507
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,880
And I don't have a problem with the bottleneck in collectability other than it's really good

508
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
information.

509
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,480
It was a really good reference point.

510
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:22,560
For the future, when here we are saying we want to represent the best gender of art in

511
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,880
the world, but the best gender of art might not actually do well at an addition of 1,000

512
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,600
or 500.

513
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,920
That may just not be the intent.

514
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,080
Long form, while I love it, obviously everything from Fidenza to CryptoPunks and all these

515
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,200
things, like I love the long form gender of art concept.

516
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,560
I also remember early on screening projects that were incredible, but should not be an

517
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,680
addition bigger than 50 or 100.

518
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,720
So we got into this conundrum where we were like, hey, it would be really nice to release

519
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,520
curated projects in addition to 50, 100, 200.

520
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,880
As someone that was collecting one of every single curated drop, in fact, multiples of

521
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,160
that, I realized also how terrifying it would be to be a collector and be presented with

522
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,960
a curated drop of 50 and realize that in order to maintain this set, I would have to purchase

523
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,560
something that was going to be in so potentially high demand.

524
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,680
And so we dropped the series designation and now curated is just curated.

525
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,120
So all of the heritage series went through eight.

526
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:35,800
To me, fits inside of this really beautiful acrylic box of like, this is the roots, this

527
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,120
is the beginning of our blocks, this is how we got started.

528
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:47,120
You see a really clear progression in technical capabilities of projects over the course of

529
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,680
that time.

530
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:54,040
And then it ends at a point where we are now recognizing in Art Blocks that we want to

531
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,560
be able to recognize a project is curated and have it be an addition of 50 or 100 or 200.

532
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,920
And so moving forward, the curatorial board is asked what they recommend and we've been

533
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,760
doing this for a little while now, what they recommend for addition size.

534
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,160
And that is what within a plus or minus what the final edition will be.

535
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,840
And I would love to see the curatorial board decide that something would be an addition

536
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:22,760
of 50 or 100, obviously have the artist agree and sign off on that and see what it looks

537
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:27,240
like to have something that we are considering to be the pioneering work in the field of

538
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,240
gender of art, but in addition to 50.

539
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,440
And that's where the series destination has been dropped, playground, factory destinations

540
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:42,200
have been dropped and we now have our blocks curated, pushing boundaries, our box presents,

541
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,960
incredible algorithmic, like I still consider them masterpieces.

542
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,160
Then we have the collaboration section, which we're really proud of that right now we're

543
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,080
currently deep in some collaborative projects with with face gallery, one of the leading

544
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,440
art galleries in the world.

545
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,240
And then most recently we added something I've been thinking about for a really long

546
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,600
time, which is living in a new category called explorations and we added a project called

547
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,040
a friendship bracelet, which is an exploration beyond just the artwork, although the artwork

548
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:18,520
is to me the NFT is the artwork, but what it looks like to actually carry instructions

549
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:24,720
in the same provenance and permanence of the Ethereum blockchain, integrate and embed instructions

550
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,640
into an artwork on how to make a physical object.

551
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,520
That doesn't fit the art for art itself narrative that we've really built and formulated for

552
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,040
Art Blocks, but it definitely fits an exploration of what gender of art can and will be for

553
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
the future.

554
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,160
And so the team came up with this really wonderful category titled for explorations, where we

555
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:51,760
will put things that Art Blocks is essentially dreaming up or commissioning ourselves.

556
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:57,480
And so we commissioned the artist to in their style create this beautiful thing that may

557
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,160
demonstrate something, whether it's a, you know, minting experience that you have to

558
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,320
like visit somewhere to get to or a, you know, physical item that you can create giving back

559
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,240
to our artists community in a way other than just releasing their work, commissioning their

560
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,760
work and putting the kind of the weight of what we created in our blocks behind something

561
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,680
that will generally hopefully be either always low cost or free.

562
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,440
Obviously that could change as ideas and projects come into the fold.

563
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,280
But yeah, really excited about that category.

564
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,240
That's where we're really going to kind of spring into this future of art or content

565
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,000
or design being created generatively beyond just like what the people's on the screen

566
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
are.

567
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Amazing.

568
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,120
Well, look forward to see how the next phase goes.

569
00:42:53,120 --> 00:43:01,680
Let's now go to, I guess, less technical practical questions, more conceptual ones.

570
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:10,360
We're going to try and rally suit utilities faster and some slower.

571
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:18,840
I had seen some work that the unit kind of two valuations team did.

572
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:23,840
Art Blocks is some gigantic percentage of the market cap of generative work.

573
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,760
85% percent, 97, 83.

574
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,880
It depends on the day.

575
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,320
Is that good, bad?

576
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Does it matter?

577
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
Is it healthy unhealthy?

578
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,880
Does it matter?

579
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:42,880
I mean, I think what matters is what happens and how this unfolds in five years and what's

580
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,440
going to guide that is people's intentions.

581
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,320
There's so many things that happen in the space.

582
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:52,840
People get shamed for selling art.

583
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:59,400
It's like, well, I never really intended on selling my crypto bunks when I got them.

584
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,240
Then there are situations that arise where it makes a lot of sense.

585
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,400
Number one, I got excited about creating Art Blocks.

586
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,760
I would sell zombies for $200, $500, which is kind of crazy to think about to pay for

587
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,760
that.

588
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,840
Also, as a father of two, eventually someone gives you an offer for an NFT that you have

589
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,680
a lot of and you say, okay, it would literally just be reckless for me not to accept this

590
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,080
offer and change the trajectory of my family's life.

591
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,400
Shaming is so bad.

592
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,960
Also people get shamed off in for having very big collections.

593
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,760
The reality is that these people will be stewards of this art and it's just way too early to

594
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,880
tell how they will steward the art.

595
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,280
I'll give you a perfect example.

596
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,520
I know the owner of the Houdis Houdat account that owns over 1,000 Chromie Squiggles and I

597
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:57,120
feel very confident in that person's intents and vision and alignment with me personally,

598
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,920
with generative art and the future of the Chromysquigle.

599
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,600
I feel like those squiggles are in really good hands.

600
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,920
We don't always know who the person is on the other end and we don't always know what

601
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:17,720
the intentions are of the person, the platform, the mechanic, but the space moves very quickly.

602
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:23,360
It is only a matter of time before we start really understanding what that dominant position

603
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:31,760
in generative and or crypto art will mean and it could very well be detrimental to the

604
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,960
future of this space, but it could also be incredibly powerful if these people hold these

605
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,680
collections, start displaying these collections and do great things with it.

606
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:51,160
There's also the concept of fractionalization which on the one hand, I do die a little bit

607
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,480
inside when someone fractionalizes a squiggle.

608
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,800
It just feels weird.

609
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:03,560
But then on the other hand, I think it's an incredibly powerful technology.

610
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,560
It's brilliant.

611
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,120
It's beautiful for democratization of art and obviously we have SEC, regulatory compliance

612
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,080
type stuff which hopefully will be kind of worked through over the course of the next

613
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,320
year or two.

614
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,960
But as much as I am uncomfortable with the little squiggle being fractionalized, I actually

615
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,520
am more excited about the power from a decentralized ownership perspective of the value proposition

616
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,920
of fractionalizing, not just art, but anything in this space.

617
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:40,920
That combination of the fractionalized stuff plus the stuff that's in high collection,

618
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:48,440
I really think that we're going to see how that plays out over the next year or two.

619
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,360
I think it's too early to tell.

620
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:55,800
I'm a very optimistic person and I tend to believe that people do things for the right

621
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:02,240
reasons for the most part and so I'm hoping for the best.

622
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,760
Next question.

623
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:13,160
There is a tremendous debate going on about royalties.

624
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,400
One side of the debate is like, wait, this is one of the good things about the NFC space

625
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,960
that artists can earn along with their collectors over time.

626
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:26,880
And another side of the debate is basically like, oh, you're so naive.

627
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,880
This is never going to work.

628
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,640
I mean, effectively it's that it's dressed up in a lot of things about blockchains and

629
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,360
code is long, whatever, but it basically is that.

630
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,280
Wait, where are you in this topic?

631
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,200
Oh, man, do we have an extra hour?

632
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,440
I would say a couple of things.

633
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,380
Number one, I think one of the things that really drove the point in for me was at a

634
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:55,200
some point somebody on my Twitter feed referring to royalties as a transfer tax.

635
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:00,520
You know, a lot of, and I think we live in a very broken society and so I'm not actually

636
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,000
going to like speak highly of what's happening with our taxes, but a lot of the reason that

637
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:10,320
taxes exist ideally is like, you know, to help pay for infrastructure and roads and things

638
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,120
that we utilize.

639
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:20,160
And generally, the word transfer tax to me is troublesome in the fact that like taxes

640
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:24,680
when utilized correctly are for the greater good and benefit the greater good.

641
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,680
But anyways, it's kind of an aside, but you know, oftentimes I see it referred to as a

642
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,720
transfer tax and that kind of bugs me a little bit.

643
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,440
I firmly believe that creator royalties are revolutionary.

644
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,360
I think it's highly problematic.

645
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:44,320
And you know, when I give lectures, I often, you know, I've gotten to speak to at this

646
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:50,720
point, thousands of not tens of thousands of people this year to give higher education,

647
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,120
giving lectures about generative art, NFTs, whatever.

648
00:48:54,120 --> 00:49:01,800
And I make it a point to point out that baked in has never existed for royalties, even though

649
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,480
they're often referred to in articles as like being baked into the smart contract, baked

650
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,000
into the artwork.

651
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,720
They have and will always be a cultural norm.

652
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:16,040
And you cannot force culture.

653
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,040
You just can't.

654
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,040
I just, I don't even care about smart contracts in this premise right now.

655
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:28,200
I'm just talking about in human life and society, you cannot force culture.

656
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:33,520
But when there's a really good culture, people rally and support around that culture.

657
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,600
And whether that culture is, you know, I don't know what blue jeans were big in the 90s or

658
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:46,720
whatever, or something relevant today, like royalties or environmental concerns, et cetera,

659
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:53,360
people rally around culture, A, because no one can force them to rally around culture.

660
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,320
Otherwise, it's not culture, it's technology.

661
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:06,960
And the, you know, I'm speaking as one of the people with the highest vested interests,

662
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,640
personally, in the perpetuation of secondary market royalties.

663
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:16,600
I don't know what the charts would say, but I'd say that I'm pretty high up there in the

664
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,520
charts of total royalties received as a creator.

665
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:23,040
I also have a really high vested interest in platform royalties, right?

666
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:30,800
So like Artbox also survives, partly because of royalties and, or creator fees or platform

667
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
fees.

668
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,120
And I guess I fail to understand, for example, if you want to go on an open C and you want

669
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,400
to see your Artbox artwork, like Artbox artwork is intended to be on chain.

670
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,600
It's reproducible from the blockchain, right?

671
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,960
Like that to me is the value proposition of Artbox.

672
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:54,120
The value proposition of Artbox from a consumer perspective is like this beautiful back end

673
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,840
that our engineers have built out to like really make strong and enable people to mint

674
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,960
and see, consume that generator already immediately.

675
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,160
The ongoing server costs of hosting the previously generated artwork, and this is both for generative

676
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:16,840
and IPFS based art, even though IPFS right now is fairly centralized and propped up.

677
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,240
We have to pay for those services.

678
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,520
So as a platform, you know, everyone's like, what's Artbox?

679
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,160
I just, now we've been releasing a lot of really cool stuff at Artbox, but like for six

680
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,080
months people were like, when marketing, when this, when that, it's like, there's actually

681
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:34,080
a limitation to what one human can do.

682
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:39,080
So in order for Artbox to have grown, Artbox had to grow in terms of a team in the terms

683
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,080
of staff.

684
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:43,080
So we're nearly 40 people now.

685
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,400
We have two choices.

686
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:50,560
We can have an ongoing revenue source that allows us to participate in our own success

687
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:56,600
as a platform in the same way that the royalties concept enables an artist to participate in

688
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,880
their own success as an individual.

689
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,800
Or we have to sell more stuff.

690
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,680
So the concept of Peter, Robin, Peter to pay Paul, in other words, oh man, we've got to

691
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,680
pay all these server fees next next month.

692
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,640
So let's just release a bunch of artwork.

693
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,360
First of all, eventually that artwork just won't sell.

694
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,080
There's actually limited amount of, there's a finite amount of money in the space, whether

695
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:24,760
it be able to get to infinite sometimes or not.

696
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,520
And so when something has to persist in perpetuity, you can choose to pay creator fees, to pay

697
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,160
platform fees.

698
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,360
And this is just kind of focusing on the platform fees for a second, so that when you

699
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:41,960
want to go list your artwork on OpenSea, there is metadata, there is a image that appears

700
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,400
in the OpenSea window or any other marketplace that you want.

701
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,760
Or you can choose, say, hey, look, the value proposition of art box is actually the stuff

702
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:49,960
is stored on chain.

703
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,520
So when you go sell your NFT, let's not cut the artist and let's not cut the platform

704
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,120
any percentages.

705
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,000
But maybe you have to go to Etherscan and regenerate your art to see what you're about

706
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,040
to buy or what you're about to sell.

707
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,000
People want the art to appear.

708
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,240
People want the art to be there so that they can utilize the fast-paced speculative concepts

709
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,880
of NFT, because generally the people that fight the creator royalties are more on the,

710
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,480
generally more on the speculative side, not always, but generatively, generally.

711
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:30,000
But you want the facility of being able to transact on a marketplace, but you don't actually

712
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:36,360
want to acknowledge that somebody had to pay for that image appearing in your browser.

713
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,760
And the more popular art box is, and I'm just using art boxes as an example, but this can

714
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,040
be applied further, the more resources that are required to serve that image and to generate

715
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,560
those algorithms and to produce algorithmic outputs.

716
00:53:51,560 --> 00:54:00,600
And so to me, it is very simple that the platform would benefit from more people utilizing the

717
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:07,920
platform and that there would be a perpetual reward for the platform, for perpetually

718
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,440
hosting the artwork.

719
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,360
To me that feels very simple and straightforward.

720
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:20,360
And that's hard to argue with, right?

721
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,520
Go download your art and put it on IPFS and then let the platform not need to continue

722
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,560
hosting your artwork if you don't want to pay those fees.

723
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,320
Now, when you go to the artist, it's a bit more complex, right?

724
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:41,960
Because the beauty of artist royalties are not apparent other than the artist making money

725
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:45,040
until the norm has existed for a while.

726
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:53,640
So I often say I consider myself an outlier when I talk about creator royalties.

727
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:58,320
I don't think that I still wake up wondering if everything that's happening is real or

728
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
not.

729
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,400
And I've said before, I'm not someone that's driven by money.

730
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,280
And so I have a very different perspective, I think.

731
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,800
Then a lot of people, and I have nothing against people that are drawn and driven by making

732
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:15,000
money, in fact, I think that's probably the normal way to operate and I consider myself

733
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,400
kind of a weirdo in that sense.

734
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:23,080
But I've also had a lot of success with some of the NFTs that I've acquired and subsequently

735
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,960
accepted offers that we're life-changing for.

736
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,520
Now, take that number, this crazy outlier number that maybe artists like myself and

737
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,600
X-copy and some of the bigger, generative artists in this space are making and cut that by a

738
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,520
hundred.

739
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:46,560
And now consider what that amount of money, whether it's 50 bucks or $500, a week would

740
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:50,720
do for someone that is making a living on art.

741
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,360
First of all, one of the most prideful moments for me in the world of art box so far is the

742
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:03,920
fact that there are now dozens of artists that created art, that were creatives part-time

743
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,720
or as a hobby that have been able to quit their job to pursue artful time.

744
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:15,000
And back to trusting artists, artists generally have good intentions and we need more art

745
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
in this world.

746
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,680
We need more conversation about art, we need more critique about art in this space.

747
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,680
We need more artists.

748
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:23,680
The world doesn't hurt when you have more artists.

749
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,640
The world might hurt when you have more other types of professions but not artists.

750
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:33,640
So let's get more artists out there.

751
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:40,680
There's such a psychological issue when you as an artist, I'll put it this way, I never

752
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,720
thought that royalties would be where they are today.

753
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,680
But man, when I released ChromiSqueals, they were $10 apiece.

754
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,080
And last I checked, they were $22,000 apiece.

755
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:57,480
I think it's incredibly difficult to understand and process how somebody would think that

756
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:04,880
it's okay psychologically for someone to create something and sell it for $10 and see somebody

757
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,360
else sell it for hundreds if not thousands of times what it was originally sold for.

758
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,680
Yeah, I priced it at $10 because I was happy with that price point and that's great.

759
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:26,360
But artists have historically watched other people profit exponentially on their work

760
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:35,080
and their craft and this technology enables us through cultural mechanisms to perpetuate

761
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,720
a process where artists now get to participate in their own success.

762
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:47,000
And whether that's $50 a week or $5,000 a week, it doesn't actually matter because the

763
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,280
$50 a week extra for an artist over the course of 10 years instead of releasing hundreds

764
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,960
of artworks because they need to continue to put food on the table.

765
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:02,200
It's like you have accumulated a little bit of IP for every artwork that you have released

766
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:08,080
and in the long run, art will thrive because there's less pressure.

767
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:13,840
There's just in some cases a little bit and in other cases a lot less pressure to produce.

768
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,160
And I can speak from experience.

769
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:19,880
I have this project being released in Mexico City in two weeks.

770
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,360
I generally am a fairly overwhelmed person with Art Blocks and just the space in general

771
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:30,720
and a family and I committed to releasing an artwork and I'm actually very proud of it.

772
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:34,120
But the amount of time that I've had to spend on it is insane.

773
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:39,640
And the idea that I would rush through something like that because I needed to sell my next

774
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:45,800
thing, the same idea that Art Blocks would have to sell more art to pay for ongoing

775
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:53,320
surgeries for employees to grow the team versus letting the artwork continue to give in a

776
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,560
small percentage for the perpetuity of the assistance of that artwork.

777
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:05,160
To me, it's hard to understand why people would have such a strong opposition to that.

778
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:08,440
And I empathize with everybody.

779
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,000
I empathize with people that are selling an entity for less than what they paid for it.

780
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,320
Sometimes as the crypto prunks project has demonstrated and some early Art Blocks projects

781
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,560
have demonstrated, people act as if somebody held a gun to their head in order to make

782
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:27,280
a purchase and make an acquisition versus them taking responsibility for purchasing

783
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,280
the thing that they purchased.

784
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,200
If I buy a house for a million bucks today and I have to sell it for half a million bucks

785
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,520
next year, you bet the realtor is going to make their commission regardless of whether

786
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,720
I made money on it or not.

787
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,880
And there's a lot of other examples of that in society.

788
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,600
So I just think that like, royalties are cultural norms, there's this beautiful opportunity

789
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,120
to like change things.

790
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,280
There's this beautiful opportunity in this nascent space to be more giving, to be more

791
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,320
charitable, to build that culture into what we're doing as artists, as platforms.

792
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:04,400
There's a beautiful opportunity in this nascent space to try to be more inclusive and diverse,

793
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,680
to concentrate on gender diversity.

794
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:15,640
There's an opportunity here and it may or may not materialize, but if it doesn't, I

795
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,720
personally will look back at it as a missed opportunity.

796
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:25,160
And that is the same with royalties, with charitable giving, with inclusivity and all

797
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,680
sorts of other parts of this.

798
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:32,120
It's like we are at the very root of something that could be revolutionary.

799
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,200
It already is in some cases for this entire planet.

800
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:42,080
We are stewards of this and this is an opportunity for us to really put things forward in the

801
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:47,640
best way in a way that makes sense for the longevity of the artwork, for the artists,

802
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,080
for the artists estate.

803
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:55,680
When I'm long gone, the fact that my children may benefit from this thing that I created

804
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,480
today, gosh, that feels good.

805
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:07,560
And I feel like it's a cultural norm and no smart contract restrictions and no shaming

806
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:17,880
and no overall fomo bullying speculation in the space is going to enforce that.

807
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:24,120
It's cultural and the more it remains cultural, I think the longer that it's going to remain

808
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:29,560
as a norm and we need to fight for that and we need to fight for the culture.

809
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:36,280
Last example, because I could speak on this for a long time, the thing that fascinates

810
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:42,440
me the most is when a collector purchases a Chromies Google OTC from a seller that doesn't

811
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,440
want to pay royalties, right?

812
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,240
Like they just don't want to deal with the market, they don't want to pay royalties and

813
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,680
the collector sends me the royalties, not the seller, but the buyer.

814
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,760
And I don't think that royalties should be imposed upon the buyer.

815
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:57,160
I actually think that they're perfectly fine on the collector.

816
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:00,520
The fact that there is a cultural, because at this point there's nothing I can do to

817
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:07,760
control it, there's a cultural drive that the collector has to take a moment, send me

818
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,920
a message on Twitter and say, hey, what's your e-federis and what's our blocks as e-federis

819
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,240
so that I can send these royalties, these creator fees, these platform fees.

820
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:25,640
Man, that speaks so much more than the opposite, which is in my opinion, trying to institute

821
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:33,200
contract level restrictions in this space, because the more you try to restrict somebody,

822
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,240
look, if you want to be decentralized, then you be decentralized.

823
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,880
If it's decentralized, that means that you can't actually impose some of these rules.

824
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:45,240
And the more you try to create rules, and this is very often visible in our political

825
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:48,960
system in the United States, for example, the more you try to impose rules, the more

826
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:55,200
you try to shame someone, the more you try to implicate people in things, the more defiant

827
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:02,840
they get, and the more vitriol they have in defending that right or that ability.

828
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:11,800
And to me, it is almost encouraging defiance to try to impose something.

829
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,120
And okay, this is really the last thing I'll say.

830
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:20,400
Our blocks released a rule last year where you can only mint one NFT per wallet, because

831
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,840
things were getting out of control with bots.

832
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,840
You know what that did?

833
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:27,600
It made it to where people wrote bots that minted 100 NFTs with 100 different wallets.

834
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,120
Like, what was I thinking?

835
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:33,320
Thinking that I could get in the middle of a decentralized technology and try to fix

836
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,240
something that was actually unfixable.

837
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,880
There is actually no solution.

838
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,440
People would yell on this score, what about the bots?

839
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,440
What are you doing about the bots?

840
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:44,240
Like, there was actually no solution, but we felt so pressured to accommodate and to

841
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,000
understand people's frustrations.

842
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,400
And it worked for the first two or three drops.

843
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,200
But then after that, it all went to shit.

844
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:55,400
And today, we don't actually know how many humans own our block pieces, because we encouraged,

845
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:00,120
we shot ourselves in the foot and we encouraged people to generate new wallets because they

846
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,680
wanted to mint more than one NFT.

847
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,240
And if that had been a successful tactic, then I would have a different opinion on some

848
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,720
of the restrictions that are happening in the NFT space today with royalties.

849
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:16,040
But it was unsuccessful because we knew deep down inside that it could be circumvented.

850
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:20,480
You cannot block someone from selling an NFT without royalties.

851
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:26,120
You cannot block someone from minting only one NFT or force someone to mint only one

852
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,080
NFT.

853
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,800
You can create hurdles.

854
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:34,960
You can make it, you can encumber them with other tasks to pull it off.

855
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,200
But as long as we're celebrating decentralization, you can't prevent it in a fully decentralized

856
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,200
manner.

857
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:45,760
And to us, at our box in general, we believe in the fact that an NFT is a sovereign fair

858
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,040
asset and something that we do not have any say in once it's minted.

859
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,560
And so we hope that people will continue to perpetuate the royalty conversation as a cultural

860
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:59,080
norm in support of artists and support of creators.

861
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:02,920
And what we're going to do is we're going to, instead of trying to punish people for

862
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,480
acting in a way that doesn't feel right to us, we're going to reward people.

863
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:12,320
And how that looks, I don't know, maybe in a far distant future, I, as snowflake, do a

864
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:19,720
drop and allow this people that have participated in the royalty convention or the cultural

865
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,120
standard and don't allow people that don't.

866
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,120
I don't know.

867
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,120
I'm not saying I'm going to do that.

868
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,720
It's just because of the beauty of the transparency, it's like, you know, we can fight decentralization

869
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,160
or we can totally embrace it.

870
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,000
There's a beautiful transparency.

871
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,440
And that transparency is something that will enable us as a platform to reward the people

872
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,000
that are perpetuating this cultural standard that has really changed so many different

873
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
people's lives.

874
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,440
Whoa, that's quite an answer.

875
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,440
Sorry.

876
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,400
It's just top of mind.

877
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,200
I also don't want to get into a Twitter debate with like thousands of people that feel so

878
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:52,440
strongly about this.

879
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:58,640
And I, you know, I really don't think it's wrong to impose creator royalties at the

880
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,120
smart contract level.

881
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:06,360
I just don't, I just, you know, a lot of times it's posed as, you know, in support of the

882
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:07,360
artist.

883
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,680
But I think long term, it's actually maybe detrimental.

884
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,280
And so we just don't want to perpetuate it in our blocks.

885
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:18,240
I do love the idea that an artist is taking a stand by imposing contract level restrictions.

886
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:19,960
I think they're sending a strong signal.

887
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:21,720
It's a very important signal.

888
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,640
And I think that that should exist and should continue to exist.

889
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,040
But for a platform that is relying on fully on decentralization of algorithms stored

890
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:36,040
on chain, it feels like the wrong move for us at our blocks to impose that kind of stuff.

891
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,160
And it feels like we've already learned our lesson with a one per wallet limit and we

892
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,240
will continue to embrace decentralization as much as possible.

893
01:06:43,240 --> 01:06:51,080
So I have a question that is a, it's kind of the same question.

894
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:56,400
Though it might seem like there's two different things.

895
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:04,520
PFP projects to some greater or lesser degree have managed to create some level of community

896
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,760
around the tokens of the project.

897
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:22,360
One of X seem like they could do that in somehow a similar way in a way that just pure one

898
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:31,440
of ones might not because there's like a natural community there.

899
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:40,040
And the, but I do think most generative artists have treated, you know, one of one of X is

900
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,800
very new and interesting and onshade and amazing and differentiated.

901
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:49,240
But most I think of the artworks artists have treated, okay, you've got a piece of my art.

902
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,240
You have a piece of my art.

903
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,240
That's fine.

904
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:59,800
I don't know that there has been a ton of innovation thinking about do we want to do

905
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,040
more with my thousand holders of whatever.

906
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:07,400
Hazers take something in the news this week, right?

907
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:12,360
It still feels a little bit unidirectional from the artists to the collector.

908
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,160
I think relevant to this question and it's not the same question.

909
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,040
It's a different question, but it's kind of the same question.

910
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,320
You don't see a ton of CC zero projects because the logic of a CC zero project, I think tends

911
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:31,640
to be that well, there'll be a broader engagement within and outside the community to bring

912
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:36,960
this lore into the public sphere, the global digital commons, et cetera.

913
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,360
And I think one of those kind of come from the same place.

914
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,160
To be honest, that it's still a fairly traditional.

915
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:47,120
I've made a piece of art and you've bought it and I hope you display it nicely.

916
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,960
And it kind of stops there.

917
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:58,600
But my question is, and noting that this is still all very unknown and un clarified even

918
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:04,560
in the PFP space, but could you imagine some version of these techniques that we're seeing

919
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:12,440
in the PFP space somehow applied to a generative art collection?

920
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,520
So I imagine a lot with the Chrome's Google and I think that Chrome's Google might be

921
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:24,520
one of the more hybrid in the fact that it's a larger edition and it is often regarded

922
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,720
as representing something or representing a community.

923
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:33,120
And lately a lot of people are saying that it kind of represents NFTs in a way which

924
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:40,760
I would never put that cloak on just because I would want to be so whatever.

925
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:47,880
But I think that, okay, well first of all, it's your first question.

926
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,640
It does feel a little unidirectional for a couple of reasons.

927
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:54,160
Number one, it's all very new.

928
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:58,440
So we're just getting started here.

929
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:04,320
Also artists creating art for the sake of art itself have generally just made art for

930
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:05,320
the sake of art itself.

931
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:07,720
That's what they have done.

932
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:14,360
It is the ones that are thinking about the secondary implications that are really going

933
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:15,600
to blow people's minds.

934
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,760
And so I agree in some cases that it feels unidirectional, but I also don't necessarily

935
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:21,480
think that is a problem.

936
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,720
I think some artists, and this, man, this goes to the CC0 debate, the licensing debate,

937
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:35,400
it's kind of like people should be held accountable for what they set out to do and following

938
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:38,760
through with anything that they promised to set out to do.

939
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,400
People should not be held accountable for a fantasy of what someone thinks somebody should

940
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:48,320
do because that's what they think is the right thing to do.

941
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,360
And so if an artist sets out to release an artwork, and it's really good artwork, the

942
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:58,640
people buy it, and the artist doesn't reward that community, other than actually being

943
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,560
in the discord and talking about their art, which I think is actually like a very beautiful

944
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,240
utility that's built into specifically Art Blocks artworks.

945
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:09,240
And not all artists stick around, but a lot of them do, especially when they have a great

946
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:10,720
reception of their art.

947
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,560
They're on Twitter, they engage.

948
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:22,520
What other, I mean, I can't text or get on discord with Damien Hirst, let's say, or other

949
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:28,120
major artists at will, whereas in this space, part of the utility is just the artist being

950
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:31,120
present.

951
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:37,600
I think that as artists form their careers, and they realize that there's an opportunity

952
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:47,360
in this space to develop a slightly different career path than the traditional artist does.

953
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:53,280
If you apply the concepts of creativity that are required to make beautiful works of art,

954
01:11:53,280 --> 01:12:00,160
and you then zoom out and realize that this entire movement is in and of itself a really

955
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:07,680
interesting conceptual performance artwork.

956
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:14,000
I think when you start seeing artists apply creativity to the concept, to the community,

957
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:23,960
to the, like, just experience, we're going to be blown away, and we're going to be really

958
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,080
rewarded for having been a collector of that artist.

959
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,880
And not all artists are going to do that, and that's okay.

960
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,120
A lot of artists are still in shock for the amount of money that they made on their artwork.

961
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,440
A lot of artists didn't want to make that much money on their artwork, especially last

962
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,080
year when things were crazy.

963
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,200
Like there's some serious mental health concerns that we address all the time internally at

964
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,160
Art Blocks for the team, for the artists, even for the collectors, all of them because

965
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:48,760
of the insanity of the space.

966
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:52,680
But ultimately, I don't think artists or people should ever be held accountable to do anything

967
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,640
with their artwork beyond what they originally set out to do.

968
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:03,240
And if they do, it should be celebrated and appreciated as, like, icing on the cake.

969
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:13,560
And as an example, I definitely am incredibly terrified of Fogo and speculation, and somebody

970
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,440
texted me yesterday and told me, Skrillex had all time high, and part of me wants to celebrate,

971
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,720
and part of me literally just wants to go hide under a rock, because the more people pay

972
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,120
for these things, the more entitled that they will get.

973
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:28,000
So right now, I think it's still reasonable, and Art Blocks is just hitting milestone after

974
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,960
milestone, and people feel that things are happening, and I guess they attribute some

975
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:37,640
of the success of Art Blocks to the success of the Chromysquiggle, and vice versa.

976
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:39,120
But then things slow down.

977
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:41,120
And it's completely predictable.

978
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:46,520
It's as predictable as the sun rising, that if the price of the Chromysquiggle starts to

979
01:13:46,520 --> 01:13:52,200
drop, people will start saying, and this happened earlier, I remember when punks, I

980
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,240
mean, when apes rose dramatically, and someone's like, what's interesting?

981
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:01,720
Skrillex and apes, and someone's response on Twitter was, apes know how to market, and

982
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,560
I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to market.

983
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,160
I'm not going to go out and market this squiggle.

984
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:13,280
All the things that are happening, to me, feel very organic.

985
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:18,400
I just, you know, I would like in the future to do really nice things for Skrillex holders.

986
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,320
I don't feel that it's appropriate for me to do that until the entire collection just

987
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:23,120
mentioned out for what it's worth.

988
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:27,880
And I definitely don't want to like suggest that I'm going to do that because I'm fully

989
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,000
cognizant of what that could potentially do for the value of the Chromysquiggle.

990
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:37,320
If I said anyone with a Chromysquiggle is going to be able to mint an artwork of my next year,

991
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:42,520
which is absolutely not what I'm doing to be clear, it could potentially increase the

992
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,680
value of the Chromysquiggle.

993
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:49,160
And that is not a good reason for the value of the Chromysquiggle to go up if it's something

994
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,840
that I've created to be a work of art for the Seagorn itself.

995
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:59,720
It's okay to have platforms like Proof and V-Friends promise future value in terms of

996
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,280
utility of air drops.

997
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:07,400
That's okay because they have the resources to perpetuate that, to continue to do that.

998
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:11,560
Not a lot of people can, but I fully believe that, you know, the Kevin Rose's and Gary

999
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:19,880
V's of this world can continue to delight their communities with things over time.

1000
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:25,120
But the art that's created for the Seagorn itself, like it doesn't feel like it should

1001
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,040
be required to do that.

1002
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:32,040
But you and I both know that in the event that an artist were to do something delightful

1003
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:37,520
like that, it would be welcomed and received and celebrated and appreciated.

1004
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,320
And generally, as artists, we like to do things that make people happy.

1005
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:44,320
I do, at least.

1006
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:46,120
Like, I'm literally, that's what I do.

1007
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,760
I like to try to do whatever I can to make people smile and make people happy.

1008
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,680
And so the opportunities will come in the future to delight the people that are supporters

1009
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:54,680
of my work.

1010
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:58,560
And I would like to do that.

1011
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,880
But the moment someone starts forcing me to do that or say that I owe them something is

1012
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:09,080
detrimental to my desire as an artist to do that.

1013
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:13,560
And I think this is a big problem with the CryptoPunks community and why eventually the

1014
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:16,240
larval labs team sold the IP.

1015
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,160
It's like, you know, you create this thing and then the world tells you what to do with

1016
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,800
your baby.

1017
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:26,280
And if you don't want to do it, the world tells you that you're an idiot or that you're stupid

1018
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:32,160
or that you're wrong or that you're, you know, extract whatever they might want to say.

1019
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:36,280
And that wasn't the original intention of the artwork.

1020
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:40,520
So I don't think that anybody owes anybody anything other than what they promised when

1021
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,160
they set out to do stuff.

1022
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:46,320
We've been very, very careful at our blogs and I'm very careful with my artwork in particular

1023
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,320
to never promise anybody any future value.

1024
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:54,600
You know, the friendship-based project that we just released is an example of value for

1025
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,680
our blogs collectors.

1026
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,920
But it's not intended to be some speculative thing.

1027
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,800
But if it has value one day, that's great.

1028
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:01,800
That's fantastic.

1029
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,600
But we never promised it to anybody.

1030
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,120
We never made anybody buy an art box artwork in order to live deemed or to receive this

1031
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,120
air drop.

1032
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:12,680
We delighted people with these really nice things that recognize people's participation

1033
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:14,080
in this space.

1034
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,960
I think it's only been two years for art box artists.

1035
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,920
I think of all of the art box artists, not that many have quit their job, but the ones

1036
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,000
that have quit their jobs will find ways to delight the people that have collected their

1037
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
work.

1038
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,120
If anything, to make them want to be repeat customers of that work.

1039
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,360
And so I think those opportunities just haven't been explored yet.

1040
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:36,080
It feels like we've been doing this for a couple of decades, but it's only been a year

1041
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,560
and a half to years.

1042
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:43,280
And I think we need to give people a little bit of space and time to kind of really think

1043
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:44,280
about.

1044
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,200
I think a lot of the artists that released art on our blogs literally have no idea what's

1045
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,480
about to happen to them.

1046
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,600
And oftentimes they talk about that moment when they unpause the project and how their

1047
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,840
life has changed ever since, not just financially, but also pressure, but also community.

1048
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:02,120
They have like fans and we should let humans take a moment to absorb everything that's

1049
01:18:02,120 --> 01:18:03,120
happening.

1050
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:09,640
I'll be the first to say that I personally have not, I can't stress this enough, I have

1051
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:16,520
not been able to take a moment and reflect and absorb and understand everything that's

1052
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:20,280
happening.

1053
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:25,560
We're humans and we need time to understand and it's going to take a long time to understand

1054
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,160
exactly what happens.

1055
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:32,040
And once the people that want to continue in this space understand what those implications

1056
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:38,480
are, I'm pretty confident it will stop feeling so unidirectional and it'll start feeling

1057
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,400
a lot more dynamic.

1058
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:44,560
And in the meantime, you know, again, like no one's forcing anyone to buy anything, but

1059
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,640
damn, like I've collected a bunch of art blogs, I think they're beautiful works of

1060
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:51,520
genital art and buying art for the sake of art itself feels like the right thing to do.

1061
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:53,720
And if it goes up in value, would they great?

1062
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,920
And if it doesn't, you know, I have to build 20 houses at this point just to show what

1063
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:03,080
genital art collection or, you know, just build a big metaverse and show it all there.

1064
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:06,120
So anyways, I'm kind of rambling there, but I just think that there's a certain amount

1065
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,840
of entitlement in the space and holding anybody accountable for anything beyond what they

1066
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:15,120
set out to do feels wrong to me.

1067
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,200
But I'm someone that's pretty laissez-faire and I believe that, you know, people should

1068
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:21,800
do what they want with their bodies and people should just, you know, as long as they're doing

1069
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,800
good, they should be allowed to make their own decisions.

1070
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,840
Okay.

1071
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:36,040
My last question is this because I know we've delayed you to your next meeting and I want

1072
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,040
to do that.

1073
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:43,920
My last question is what question should I have asked you, but I didn't.

1074
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:44,920
Ooh.

1075
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,920
Oh, man, you've asked some good ones.

1076
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,040
Some very pertinent ones.

1077
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,440
Yeah.

1078
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,760
You didn't ask me who my favorite Art Blocks artist is, which is something I'm very grateful

1079
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:04,760
for.

1080
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:09,240
I don't know if you can get that question and have to like pick a child, like my favorite

1081
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,240
child.

1082
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,240
Yeah, that's it.

1083
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:13,240
I don't know.

1084
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,040
I think you nailed it.

1085
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,040
Okay.

1086
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:21,720
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

1087
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,920
We very much appreciate the time.

1088
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:27,960
The insight, I will say I can't.

1089
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:37,200
I couldn't be more excited about the future of generative art, both in the net, both

1090
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:43,400
as art, but then I think in other digital objects that will become generative.

1091
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,960
And then maybe as you say in the long run, we'll figure out how we do this in the physical

1092
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:46,960
world as well.

1093
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:52,520
But in the meantime, for sure, for virtual goods, this will absolutely happen.

1094
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:58,160
And I mean, one mental model I have, I think it's, it makes the world a more beautiful

1095
01:20:58,160 --> 01:20:59,160
place.

1096
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:00,160
Absolutely.

1097
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:05,080
And that just so literally makes the world a more beautiful place, a more unique and diverse

1098
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:10,880
and, you know, just dynamic, dynamic world.

1099
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,600
And I can't wait to see everybody wearing friendship bracelets next time I see you.

1100
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,120
All right, sir.

1101
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,680
Thank you so much.

1102
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:20,640
Thank you so much for having me.

1103
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,440
I appreciate it.

1104
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,040
Hello.

1105
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:30,840
Hi, hi.

1106
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,800
Hi.

1107
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,400
Good morning, good evening.

1108
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,880
Good morning to you, I guess.

1109
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:40,320
Good evening here in Europe.

1110
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:45,400
Thank you very much for this amazing discussion you've had with 6'5 to 9", with just what's

1111
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,360
that and it was really brilliant.

1112
01:21:49,360 --> 01:22:00,040
As you might know, we ask our guests if they can to spend a few more minutes with us taking

1113
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,520
questions from our students.

1114
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,080
So thank you very much for being here for that.

1115
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:13,640
Just a note for the people that are listening to us now either on the OM or YouTube.

1116
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:19,480
As always, please post your questions either in the OM chat or on Twitter using the hashtag

1117
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,640
NFTQNA.

1118
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:30,320
Please don't post live questions on YouTube because we're not monitoring that chat.

1119
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:35,720
So let me start off with a number of questions from the students already.

1120
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:43,840
Some of them are quite practical, let's say, regarding how our blocks operates.

1121
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:51,200
But rather start with the discussion you just had with, I mean, we just heard the discussion

1122
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,240
that you've had with 6'5 to 9", regarding royalties.

1123
01:22:55,240 --> 01:23:01,960
I know that you sort of had the... yeah, it's a hot topic for everyone.

1124
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:05,880
I see lots of discussions in the chat while you were discussing with 6'5 to 9".

1125
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:13,480
So I know you advocated for a more, let's say, less effort or kind of cultural norm approach

1126
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:21,200
to how this thing is going to be resolved instead of, let's say, imposing restrictions

1127
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,640
on smart contracts.

1128
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:29,000
But I'd like to ask you, in the decentralized world and especially in the original Bitcoin

1129
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:37,760
communities and everything, there was this mode of code is low and that rules should

1130
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,600
be embedded in smart contracts and be respected by everyone because otherwise it's going to

1131
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,600
be clear.

1132
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:49,720
So how do you feel regarding this?

1133
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:58,760
Can we trust the collective to come up with a unified homogeneous like, resolved to this

1134
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:06,240
question or should we at some point agree on what should happen and make it on the contract

1135
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:07,240
level?

1136
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:13,720
Well, number one, I just want people to understand that this will never actually be resolved.

1137
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:18,240
This will never be something that is just stamped, done, finished, move on.

1138
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:27,400
Number two, I do believe that code should be law, but only when the code can be law.

1139
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:34,440
And so we embrace decentralization, we embrace the sovereignty of owning these things in

1140
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:36,440
a way that really didn't exist before you.

1141
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,360
I mean, we couldn't own digital assets before.

1142
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,360
We can't.

1143
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:48,040
We can provably own the digital asset, but we can't provably force anyone to pay a

1144
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,800
royalty.

1145
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:54,600
You can't block someone from operating without paying a royalty.

1146
01:24:54,600 --> 01:24:56,720
You can hamper their efforts.

1147
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,800
You can make it difficult.

1148
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:03,400
You can make it complicated, but you can't block it unless you get really restrictive

1149
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,040
and you start actually putting restrictions on the ability to transfer an NFT with permission.

1150
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:14,520
So there is a world where you can actually guarantee royalties, but you'd have to restrict

1151
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:15,760
the ability to transfer.

1152
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:18,000
And so I'll give you an example.

1153
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,960
Last year I created this kind of, I worked with a consultant created this crazy level

1154
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:30,520
of security, cold storage, two week delay for all of my R-blocks NFTs.

1155
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:36,800
And then I transferred 2,400 R-blocks NFTs to this wallet.

1156
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:43,840
And it would feel pretty weird to me if there was some mechanism required for me to have

1157
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,480
approval in order for me to transfer.

1158
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:47,840
I wasn't selling them.

1159
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:51,480
No royalty should be paid when you transfer from one wallet to the other.

1160
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:57,560
But you have to transfer your assets every now and then imagine someone gets hacked,

1161
01:25:57,560 --> 01:25:58,560
compromised.

1162
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,520
And you're watching stuff happening and I guess you need approval that even the hacker

1163
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,520
can't steal your NFTs.

1164
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:08,000
I guess that's maybe that's a good thing right there.

1165
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,040
But yeah, I mean, ultimately I don't know that unless you go to those levels of restrictions,

1166
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:17,400
which what happens if the approver loses their keys?

1167
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:19,960
Are you no longer able to transfer your NFT again?

1168
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:26,040
You know, there's a lot of things that make me uncomfortable with that level of control.

1169
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:31,600
And if you don't go to that level of control, then code is not law.

1170
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,400
And unfortunately if code is not law, I believe that we're encouraging people to act in a

1171
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,120
way that will prove that code is not law.

1172
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:45,040
Because that's generally how society likes to be both good people and bad people.

1173
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:51,160
They like to show and prove that their position is valid.

1174
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:57,920
And that's one position that seems very easy to prove that you can get around these restrictions

1175
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,160
at any point.

1176
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:05,000
And there's a lot of arguments that it's hard to get around the restrictions and it is.

1177
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:10,680
It's actually really kind of annoying to try to figure out how to get through, how to wrap an NFT.

1178
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:15,720
But it only gets easier as people build tools to make it easier.

1179
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,680
And over time, my opinion is that, you know, there's this thought that like, you know,

1180
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,280
our royalty is going to zero.

1181
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:27,000
I don't actually think or I can't tell you with certainty that I'm correct.

1182
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,720
But I think there's actually two paths.

1183
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:35,280
I think that there's a path that royalties go to zero because people try to enforce royalties

1184
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:39,480
at the smart contract level in a way that's completely impossible to enforce unless we

1185
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:42,240
restrict transfer ship.

1186
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:47,160
And then there's the other path where royalties go to zero because of the cultural, you know,

1187
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,520
because we believe that we should reward people that operate in good behavior and then everybody

1188
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:53,640
just becomes a bad, you know, actor, I guess.

1189
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:57,200
I don't think that people that don't pay royalties are bad humans.

1190
01:27:57,200 --> 01:28:00,200
By the way, I just, everybody has their motives for being in the space, right?

1191
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:04,320
And that's what we need to understand.

1192
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:08,640
But I think for someone to stand up and say, this is the way for royalties not to go to

1193
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,640
zero.

1194
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:18,520
And the other way, the potential culturally sensitive, non-restrictive, you know, positive

1195
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,200
reinforcement way is the wrong way.

1196
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:27,440
I feel like that's actually a pretty bold statement to make also.

1197
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:31,360
And I don't, again, there's no solution here.

1198
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,520
And I think it's just more of like, let's see how it goes.

1199
01:28:34,520 --> 01:28:41,400
We've been told that Art Blocks, artworks consistently have a higher percentage of sales

1200
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:43,960
that include a royalty than a lot of others.

1201
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:49,720
And I think that this narrative that we've pushed so hard, I mean, to the point of dying

1202
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:56,000
on a hill of buy the art for the sake of art itself, like support the artists, participate

1203
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:03,720
in this new thing of collecting art and understanding art and whatever, that seems to have an implication

1204
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:08,720
towards people's desire to want to continue to support the artists.

1205
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:14,680
And I guess the last thing I'd say is if somebody wants to sell a chromisquiggle and

1206
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:20,920
do not pay, like just so adamant about not paying a chromisquiggle royalty, not sending

1207
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:29,240
me fees or not sending Art Blocks their fees, like, I just can't imagine, you know, reaching

1208
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,000
out and be like, you're an asshole.

1209
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,400
It's just, it is what it is.

1210
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,880
Like we just need to kind of embrace it and work through it.

1211
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:36,880
I agree.

1212
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,640
Very related question.

1213
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:43,080
I think you sort of answered it, but I'm going to ask it anyway.

1214
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:48,120
Aside from what you think is fair or desired, what do you think will eventually happen?

1215
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:52,280
Where is the royalties narrative converging to?

1216
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:53,280
I think that's interesting.

1217
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:59,280
I can't remember if I mentioned in the interview before, but a lot of royalties that I receive

1218
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,680
and Art Blocks receives, because this is really interesting, right?

1219
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,080
We have two parties here.

1220
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,880
We have two interested parties and some people would make an argument that the creator fees

1221
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:08,720
are more important than the platform fees.

1222
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:13,280
And obviously, we want to support the creators.

1223
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,360
Also, people want upgrades and updates to our blocks and they want us to grow the platform,

1224
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,040
make it bigger and grow the team and give you more features.

1225
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:23,800
And so, you know, we also have to be cognizant of the fact that these, you know, the expansion

1226
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:30,160
of the platform sometimes requires revenue.

1227
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:37,080
I think that given that a lot of collectors sometimes will purchase a squiggle from a person

1228
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,920
that doesn't want to pay royalties.

1229
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:43,080
And the purchaser takes it upon themselves to reach out to me to request the information

1230
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:49,560
to send the royalties is a demonstration of this being a completely unenforceable cultural

1231
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:55,160
norm where the creator and the collector are creating a long-term relationship that

1232
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:59,880
is going to be mutually beneficial.

1233
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:07,840
That collector is making sure that, you know, as I release new work, maybe I'm going to

1234
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,840
ask them for feedback.

1235
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:11,680
I mean, this is actually a pertinent example.

1236
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:17,720
There's a collecting group that reached out to semi-royalties for a squiggle they recently

1237
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:21,600
purchased and I was like, by the way, I'm working on this project for Mexico City, for

1238
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,840
Bright Moments, you know, I'd love to get your feedback on it.

1239
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,160
And they got a bit of an early view on it and they got to give me a little bit of feedback.

1240
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,600
Like, some people don't give a shit about that and that's fine.

1241
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:35,560
So like, if you don't care about that kind of relationship, then no big deal.

1242
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,800
Oftentimes, we are angry at the traditional art world for being so restrictive and gating

1243
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,120
and like only certain people get access.

1244
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:50,160
But, you know, I've said this before, like, if you're rewarding people for being a good

1245
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:54,400
customer, you know, at the traditional art gallery, if you're rewarding someone for being

1246
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:58,240
a thoughtful, meaningful collector that gives you feedback and advice and goes out of their

1247
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:03,880
way to like, send you royalties, even when the seller didn't want to.

1248
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:09,440
Do you think that it would make any sense for me to completely ignore those people and

1249
01:32:09,440 --> 01:32:15,200
instead release an artwork that's available for anybody to mint?

1250
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,640
It feels like if I was that person that was going out of my way to pay the royalties,

1251
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:25,760
if I was going out of that way, out of my way to give feedback and I was not given an

1252
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:32,120
opportunity to kind of have early access to a piece or at least an early raffle to a piece,

1253
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:35,120
I would feel a little bit let down and betrayed.

1254
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,600
And so I just think people need to be aware of that.

1255
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:45,360
Like, I will never release another 10K PFP-type level artwork, you know, and there's a lot

1256
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:50,240
more squiggle owners than there are potential artworks that I can have in the future.

1257
01:32:50,240 --> 01:32:58,080
And I think it's very reasonable for me to want to reward the people that are trading

1258
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:05,520
my squiggles and paying royalties, not punish the people that don't, but reward the people

1259
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,600
that are.

1260
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:11,240
And I think that creators have a lot of power here in that sense.

1261
01:33:11,240 --> 01:33:13,920
And the only time will tell how this all plays up.

1262
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:19,840
But I really think that this is something that's going to be a pretty impactful part.

1263
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:24,880
It's going to be 30% less now that everything's kind of going to shit on these marketplaces,

1264
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,800
but it's still going to be part of the narrative.

1265
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:33,120
At least for our blocks, it will continue to be the theme of supporting our artists.

1266
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:34,800
Yeah.

1267
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,040
Okay.

1268
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:42,960
So moving on to the more practical questions, but still related to the reality, I guess.

1269
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:49,200
So I have one student asking, if there are any CC0 work looks projects at the moment.

1270
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:58,160
I'm asking if someone could make derivatives of squiggles if they're a non-holder.

1271
01:33:58,160 --> 01:34:01,200
So CC0, we do, we have a few.

1272
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,360
And I've been very public about my stance on CC0.

1273
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,680
I think it's very, something very intriguing.

1274
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:08,000
And I think it's wonderful that the world is exploring it.

1275
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,600
Obviously, I don't have the guts encouraged to release something CC0, but that doesn't

1276
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,680
mean that it's wrong.

1277
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:18,520
I'd say up there with my favorites, there's a project called Supermental.

1278
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:27,040
And then I believe, is it, I'll go rhythms, but I'll go beats by Han and Ichael Estaniel

1279
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,440
are also released to CC0.

1280
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,960
And I'm sure there's a multitude more out there.

1281
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:36,120
It's a really interesting concept, since this is a university conversation, I'd like to

1282
01:34:36,120 --> 01:34:37,880
get a little bit of to show here.

1283
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,200
At Art Blocks, we do all these exhibitions.

1284
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,840
And we like to ask A, the artist, of course, their permission to exhibit their work, but

1285
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,840
it'd be we like to ask the collector for their permission to exhibit the work.

1286
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,720
And there's just too many artworks for us not to do that, right?

1287
01:34:52,720 --> 01:34:55,640
Like if someone collector says, I don't want to show it, well, we can always show another

1288
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:58,240
person's work.

1289
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:07,440
And a very smart artist came back to me one time with the CC0 release and said, well,

1290
01:35:07,440 --> 01:35:10,560
why are you asking collectors for permission to show the work at CC0?

1291
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,320
You have this permission, right?

1292
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,960
And I thought that was a really interesting point.

1293
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:20,280
And I actually very much defend it and understand it.

1294
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:26,560
The idea that CC0 is stripping potentially permission from the artist from displaying

1295
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,720
their work, I mean, but then also from the collector, I think it's fascinating.

1296
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:33,480
And so I think we still believe it very strongly that with Art Blocks, it's like whether it's

1297
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:36,280
CC0 or not, like somebody is the owner of that artwork.

1298
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,920
And we'd love to get permission.

1299
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,880
We'd like to get a blessing that that artwork is going to appear.

1300
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,480
So it's leading to some really interesting things.

1301
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:47,920
Because if Art Blots were to ever make prints and we wanted a token gate, prints, obviously

1302
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:53,600
just the way infinite objects, token gates, squiggles, would we token gate CC0?

1303
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,600
Because why would we?

1304
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:55,600
Right?

1305
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:56,600
You don't have to own it.

1306
01:35:56,600 --> 01:36:01,840
So anyways, I think it's going to be really fun to explore what CC0 means in the world

1307
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,840
of art.

1308
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:07,320
Obviously in the world of PFPs, it has some really interesting impacts and implications.

1309
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:11,200
And then in the world of art for art itself, I think it's going to be a really fun next

1310
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,840
couple of years as we explore what all that means.

1311
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:18,800
Regarding the Chromisquiggle, that's a little bit more complex.

1312
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,640
So there is a license.

1313
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:22,440
It's called the NFT license.

1314
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:26,160
And I've been working with an attorney on expanding the NFT license.

1315
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,160
And I'm way overdue.

1316
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:28,160
I mean, it's in my backpack.

1317
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:31,080
I'm ready to release it.

1318
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:36,760
Just have some tiny little stuff that gets in the way.

1319
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:38,720
If you don't own it, no.

1320
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:44,160
The NFT license says that if you own the NFT, you can commercialize the light, the lightliness

1321
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:48,480
of the NFT of the Chromisquiggle for up to $100,000 a year without asking me any kind

1322
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,800
of permission.

1323
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,440
There's things that happen if you exceed $100,000 in revenue a year.

1324
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:55,800
So that gets a little bit complex.

1325
01:36:55,800 --> 01:37:01,080
And that's why it's really important to reach out and kind of be in touch with the creator

1326
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:02,320
in advance of what you're doing.

1327
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:07,520
Because if the project exceeds $100,000, then there are licensing agreements that need

1328
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,600
to come into place.

1329
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,320
The NFT license that we're releasing is trying to be a little bit more innovative in saying,

1330
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:19,600
look, if you release a project, you get your $100,000 a year max end of story.

1331
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,640
If you reach out to me in advance and clear with me what you're working on, now, to be

1332
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,680
clear, you don't have to clear anything with me.

1333
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:32,120
You can go make shwarma, squiggle, whatever you want to do.

1334
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:37,000
But if you start exceeding that cap, I can and will, if you're making something that

1335
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:41,800
makes me uncomfortable, like maybe squiggle underwear or something, say, okay, you are

1336
01:37:41,800 --> 01:37:45,560
no longer allowed to continue making this product.

1337
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:49,280
With the updated squiggle license, what I'm doing to try to encourage people to reach

1338
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:54,640
out and give me their ideas of what they're working on so that I can give them in advance

1339
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,600
the yes, even when you exceed the license.

1340
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,520
We're expanding the value, the revenue to $250,000 a year instead of $100,000 a year

1341
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:08,280
for anyone that's willing to reach out in advance and clear what they're working on,

1342
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:13,480
not for the first $250,000 but for what happens after you exceed that.

1343
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:17,480
If you don't own a chromium squiggle, the only thing that you can really do is if you

1344
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:22,760
have a website and you make something for people that own chromium squiggles, then you could

1345
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:28,120
potentially help people that own a chromium squiggle make something that they want to

1346
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:30,080
make.

1347
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:33,960
That's not super clear in the license and so what we did is say, okay, yeah, you can

1348
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:39,680
do this, but number one, you can't advertise it as chromium squiggles by SnowPro.

1349
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:47,080
It cannot help you generate more revenue by utilizing the brand and you have to token

1350
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:48,080
get it.

1351
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:50,960
In other words, you have to agree in advance that any products that you make for anybody

1352
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:55,680
that owns a chromium squiggle that they are the rightful owner of that chromium squiggle

1353
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:56,680
before you make it.

1354
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:58,400
Hello, can you hear me?

1355
01:38:58,400 --> 01:38:59,400
Yes.

1356
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,400
Did I lose you?

1357
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,400
Hello?

1358
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
Uh oh.

1359
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:12,400
Oh, okay, you can hear me.

1360
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:20,240
Yeah, I can hear you now.

1361
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,400
I think we were cut off.

1362
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:28,320
I lost a few when you were saying what happens if you are a nonholder and what the updated

1363
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:32,200
license clarifies about this situation.

1364
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:38,280
If you're a nonholder, you cannot exploit any specific chromium squiggles, but you can

1365
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,240
help other people exploit their own.

1366
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:46,880
In other words, you can have a website that sells merch that allows someone that owns

1367
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:54,120
a chromium squiggle to make their own chromium squiggle on that merch.

1368
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:56,000
There's just some rules on how you can imply that.

1369
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,400
But the squiggle is not CC0.

1370
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,400
It is a licensed item.

1371
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:06,800
And part of the value proposition I think of the NFT is owning it gives you some permissions

1372
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:07,800
and some rights.

1373
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:13,560
So if you don't own a chromium squiggle, ideally you're not out there making merch or doing

1374
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,760
anything specific with luck.

1375
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:20,000
And at the very least, if you're doing something with a chromium squiggle, because if you go

1376
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,200
make 20 hats, you're not going to hear from me, but you should at the very least get permission

1377
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:29,320
from the person that owns that chromium squiggle, or at least a blessing or a head nod.

1378
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,600
Because really, this, again, a lot of these things are cultural.

1379
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,120
None of these things matter until there's a lawsuit involved.

1380
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:40,200
I can't imagine really what it would be like for me to sue someone over making a bunch

1381
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,600
of shirts or a bunch of hats.

1382
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:47,280
I mean, we would maybe ask for a takedown if they're doing something that is egregious.

1383
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,960
I don't want squiggles printed on bad quality stuff.

1384
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:53,120
I don't want crappy merch with them.

1385
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:57,400
But if you're doing good stuff, if you're making good things, I'm excited to see more

1386
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,560
chromium squiggles out in the world and more power to you.

1387
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,560
Super.

1388
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:10,640
And that's to be clear, the $250,000 rule that we mentioned, is this an update to the old

1389
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:14,040
$100,000 limit, or is it just the case of-

1390
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,080
We haven't updated license.

1391
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:20,520
No, so we haven't updated license and the license is addressing what it looks like for

1392
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:24,560
museums and exhibition centers to acquire the NFT.

1393
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:28,120
Just a little bit of wording in there because that's happening a little bit more and more.

1394
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:36,600
And also, we're trying to give people an incentive to reach out to me and let me know what you're

1395
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:38,320
doing with your squiggles.

1396
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:45,720
So you create chromisquiggle boxers and all of a sudden, and you sell $100,000 worth of

1397
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:47,440
boxers, fine, no big deal.

1398
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:52,200
All of a sudden, they become like Nike wants to license the chromisquiggle.

1399
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:54,160
And all of a sudden, it's like a million dollar thing.

1400
01:41:54,160 --> 01:41:58,160
I probably won't want chromisquiggle boxers to exist at that scale.

1401
01:41:58,160 --> 01:42:03,680
And so I would be able to tell you, initially, hey, feel free to operate within the license.

1402
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:06,240
But if you exceed that, we're going to put a stop to it.

1403
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:10,040
Like, it definitely don't want a global brand of chromisquiggle underwear to exist.

1404
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,840
And that's kind of what that license is saying.

1405
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:16,040
It's kind of like saying, hey, look, as an entrepreneur, what does it take for you to

1406
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:18,840
make a $100,000 in revenue on a hat?

1407
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,560
Like, that's a lot of hats.

1408
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:24,800
And so as an entrepreneur, a lot of us just small scale, we want to just have fun.

1409
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:25,800
We want to make stuff.

1410
01:42:25,800 --> 01:42:28,280
We want to see what we can do.

1411
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:33,160
And that's what that license is there to do, is to let people tinker and have fun and not

1412
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:35,320
have to ask questions unless you're getting serious.

1413
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:39,200
And if you're getting serious, then we want to know and we want to be involved in the

1414
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:40,200
process.

1415
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,200
Okay.

1416
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:47,080
I think we have at least a few artists among our students because I have one, two, three

1417
01:42:47,080 --> 01:42:54,400
questions asking more or less, how can an artist be eligible to be included in an art

1418
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,000
blocks collection in the future?

1419
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And they put a collection inside that.

1420
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:05,440
Well, number one absolutely has to be generated algorithmically, period.

1421
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:10,800
Like, there's nothing we can do at our blogs to host any artwork that already exists.

1422
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:16,080
In fact, the magic of Art Blocks is that the artwork does not exist until it's purchased.

1423
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:22,280
So if you're looking at a piece of art, it's already not compatible with that straightforward.

1424
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:25,680
Number two, you need to be able to write an algorithm and that algorithm needs to be written

1425
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:31,680
in pure JavaScript or a few libraries that are compatible with JavaScript.

1426
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:37,440
The majority of projects released in our blocks are pure JavaScript, P5JS or 3JS with a couple

1427
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,440
variants out there.

1428
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:45,440
The project needs to be already established and ready to go when you apply.

1429
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:48,800
A lot of people early on would apply with an idea and then be disappointed to know that

1430
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,680
we don't have coders at Art Blocks.

1431
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:55,280
I think it's in fact like a conflict of interest for Art Blocks to support an artist on how

1432
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,760
to create their code to then be screened and then potentially curated on the platform.

1433
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:01,640
It just doesn't feel right.

1434
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:07,200
And then also a lot of times people reach out asking for help coordinating with the coder

1435
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:10,800
and that has led to some kind of awkward situations.

1436
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,480
So we really don't do that either.

1437
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:16,560
Really, when you're applying to Art Blocks, you need to come with an algorithm ready to

1438
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:18,200
release on the platform.

1439
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,920
And so then it's submitted and there's two layers of screening, screening one, which

1440
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:27,560
accepts about 15% of the artworks that are submitted to Art Blocks.

1441
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,560
1515.

1442
01:44:28,560 --> 01:44:29,560
1515.

1443
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:36,800
Yeah, it's a reflection of us studying very carefully the market share that we have.

1444
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:44,200
Like the participants in our community compared to the amount of work that was coming in,

1445
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,200
so being submitted.

1446
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:50,680
At some points we get 200 applications a week and we release six artworks a week at most

1447
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,440
and in fact often less.

1448
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:56,120
So 15% of them get through and once it gets through, that means it will be released on

1449
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:59,480
our blocks and it'll be released on our blocks in one of two categories.

1450
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:02,360
It'll either be released in our blocks curated or our box presents.

1451
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:06,160
So once the artwork gets through and into our box, it goes through a second round and

1452
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:13,520
this is where we actually have a formal, more academic board of curators that decide not

1453
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:17,800
which projects are great because we already think the project is great if we're releasing

1454
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,320
it on our blocks, but which projects are pushing the boundaries, which projects are kind of

1455
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:27,520
making us even internally rethink the way that we think about generative art or what

1456
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:30,760
can be done, what's possible with generative art.

1457
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:35,560
And those projects get tagged as curated and released on a slower schedule once every

1458
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:37,480
other week we release a curated project.

1459
01:45:37,480 --> 01:45:44,720
So at this point, unless the market expands significantly, we're releasing roughly 24

1460
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:49,280
curated projects a year.

1461
01:45:49,280 --> 01:45:52,720
And yeah, that's kind of what we have.

1462
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:54,360
We have a new category called explorations.

1463
01:45:54,360 --> 01:46:02,320
It's pretty fun where our blocks is actually getting to explore things that we've been

1464
01:46:02,320 --> 01:46:06,560
thinking about for a long time, we just released a friendship bracelet project last week where

1465
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:11,280
these are ideas that I've had for years about what it means to own something, what the difference

1466
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:17,640
is between a digital and a physical that's connected and potentially has the ability to

1467
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:22,200
lose value when they're separated versus something that's ephemeral that has an almost intangible

1468
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:25,200
value to it but is still meaningful.

1469
01:46:25,200 --> 01:46:32,160
Things like that, our blocks consumed in the example of the friendship bracelets by itself

1470
01:46:32,160 --> 01:46:40,040
our blocks consumed me entirely to the point where I was unable to tinker and really get

1471
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:44,400
behind again, what is this technology, what's the power of this technology.

1472
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:49,000
And so if I would have had to release that project on my own, which in fact, when I first

1473
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,320
approached Alexi Andre on that project, it was almost six months ago, maybe eight months,

1474
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:58,200
maybe a year ago, I don't know, with the intention of releasing it as I could just separate collaborative

1475
01:46:58,200 --> 01:47:01,680
work between me and Alexi Andre.

1476
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,880
It may never have happened but getting the weight of our blocks behind to help tell the

1477
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:14,560
story and explain what's happening with these physical ephemeral physical objects really

1478
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,560
made things happen.

1479
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:19,960
So that's the third category called explorations and then of course we have some collaborations

1480
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:23,720
like what we're collaborating with, pace and pace gallery, one of the biggest galleries

1481
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,600
in the world, they bring their own artists to the platform and they release artwork there

1482
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:28,600
as well.

1483
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:29,600
Great.

1484
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:32,040
I've got two follow up questions on that.

1485
01:47:32,040 --> 01:47:39,680
So the first one is if the artwork is not known until it's purchased, how do artists

1486
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:46,400
and the curators board test the output before the artworks are minted, how do you know if

1487
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:50,240
the mints are likely to be beautiful as a collection, how do this happen?

1488
01:47:50,240 --> 01:47:51,240
That's a good question.

1489
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:56,480
So the final edition size is going to be, let's say, an edition of 100.

1490
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:59,160
The final exact edition size is unknown.

1491
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:04,600
I mean, the final outputs of the final edition sizes are unknown but the algorithm exists

1492
01:48:04,600 --> 01:48:06,280
and the algorithm can be run.

1493
01:48:06,280 --> 01:48:11,680
So you can press play on the algorithm and see an example output.

1494
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:16,400
These example outputs demonstrate the variability of an algorithm and that algorithm could have

1495
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,680
millions, billions of possible outputs.

1496
01:48:20,680 --> 01:48:26,680
What's special about our blocks is that we're forcing the artist to pre-curate the algorithm

1497
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:30,240
to make sure that they stand behind and are excited about anything that could potentially

1498
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:37,160
come out of that mentor and then also to sign off on a very compact final output set.

1499
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:40,920
So if the algorithm can handle millions of outputs, they're setting that as an edition

1500
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:47,200
of 1,000 or 10,000 and then they're locking that and saying the only artworks that represent

1501
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:52,040
this body of work, the final body of work are the ones that were created during the mint

1502
01:48:52,040 --> 01:48:57,480
but you can press refresh on a browser and refresh over and over all the artworks.

1503
01:48:57,480 --> 01:49:02,840
So effectively you simulate the output and you simulate the outputs.

1504
01:49:02,840 --> 01:49:08,400
A related question is, are all Art Blocks projects minted in the same way with a common

1505
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:14,000
standard required and how much does it cost usually to go through the whole process?

1506
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:19,840
Well, we are all over the place on how we made the most standard is a Dutch auction.

1507
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:25,360
We use a Dutch auction as a method for there to be a little bit of price discovery and

1508
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:32,440
also to ensure that a strong collector is given the opportunity to collect the work because

1509
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:37,680
even though it be at a higher price, if they want the artwork, they can get the artwork

1510
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:39,720
before their second gas work.

1511
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:44,800
It lessens the gas works a little bit, not as much as we'd like.

1512
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:46,960
Artworks can be released at a fixed price.

1513
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:52,040
We discourage it, especially recently things have heated up a little bit more for Art Blocks

1514
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:56,640
and so the fixed price auctions are being bought.

1515
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:01,360
It's really funny to look back now at how strongly the community pushed back on the

1516
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:07,240
Dutch auction and really wanted us to leave things at fixed price because it made it possible

1517
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:11,680
for the most part for people to be able to flip more.

1518
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:17,680
Right now that we're seeing what a sophisticated bot can do, literally consume an entire collection,

1519
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:20,720
we realize, and that's what we were trying to avoid with the Dutch auction, is that we

1520
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:24,720
realize that if you don't have price discovery in place and one or two people can completely

1521
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:30,840
ruin your ability as a collector to attain that work or to have the minting experience.

1522
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:35,000
To me, I still think one of the most important things about Art Blocks and one of the things

1523
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:38,480
that will continue to define us, especially as people will explore alternative minting

1524
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:43,680
methods is that moment of surprise when you mint something and you don't know what you're

1525
01:50:43,680 --> 01:50:44,680
going to get.

1526
01:50:44,680 --> 01:50:49,800
Okay, I've got many, many questions but I'll try to respect your time because I know

1527
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:55,560
you're very busy so I'm trying to pick up a last one.

1528
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,120
We have time for a few more.

1529
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:00,840
I mean, I haven't until 9.30.

1530
01:51:00,840 --> 01:51:02,720
I'll ask two then.

1531
01:51:02,720 --> 01:51:06,360
So the first one is, are you concerned about supply versus demand issues?

1532
01:51:06,360 --> 01:51:11,280
Is there an internal discussion in what looks about market conditions and the supply being

1533
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,440
issued for its collection?

1534
01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:20,160
Yeah, we are constantly having internal discussions.

1535
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,960
Am I concerned?

1536
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:24,400
No, I mean, this is the thing.

1537
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:32,440
We often say, like, at our blocks, we are in a river that is moving very quickly through

1538
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:37,560
rapids with no paddles.

1539
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:44,800
Supply feels excessive when things slow down and then things pick up and we can't have

1540
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,640
anything in stock and then everything else, then all of this, like when there's nothing

1541
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:53,800
left to mint on our blocks, prices settle higher on the Dutch auction because there's

1542
01:51:53,800 --> 01:51:55,240
nothing to buy anymore.

1543
01:51:55,240 --> 01:52:03,040
And there's no right or wrong there, there's not like a, it's just, it's very difficult

1544
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:06,200
to control or to manage what that looks like.

1545
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:11,560
And so I think it's naive to think that anybody would be able to react quickly enough.

1546
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:15,960
Yes, Art Blocks could be a little bit more authoritarian and make decisions on behalf

1547
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:21,240
of the artist, but you have to understand, for example, an artist determines their minting

1548
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:26,080
style for their work, sometimes six to eight weeks before the release.

1549
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:31,360
So you know, something for.1 ETH today, if ETH were to go to 10,000, all of a sudden

1550
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:36,320
it's like $1,000 for the artwork and we can adjust those things, but you'll see that based

1551
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:42,520
on the transparency of the space, you know, if we have it listed for.1 ETH for five weeks,

1552
01:52:42,520 --> 01:52:50,120
and then the week before we make this decision that ETH is just so high that it can't, you

1553
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,400
can't afford that piece, then the artist is in a really bad spot because they lower the

1554
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:58,600
price and then the community gets upset because we changed the price, etc.

1555
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:06,360
So it, I think that there's an opportunity there to study the market and be as tight

1556
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:13,440
as we can of the market, but understand also that it's naive to think that we can actually

1557
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:18,080
control anything in the market.

1558
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:20,640
This is as much as we can't control the price of Ethereum.

1559
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:24,480
Just as, I mean, what we can do, what we do have a goal for it, our blocks, let's just

1560
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,440
make this very clear, our goal at our blocks is to increase the number of people that

1561
01:53:28,440 --> 01:53:31,280
enjoy our work.

1562
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:35,720
And that's not to pump our bags, that's because we believe that we have something that is

1563
01:53:35,720 --> 01:53:42,320
going to be relevant way outside of the 400,000 wallets that currently operate within the NFT

1564
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:43,320
ecosystem.

1565
01:53:43,320 --> 01:53:49,960
If you understand that and you understand there's 400,000 people that have an NFT or

1566
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:54,840
that are active in the MTF space and there's 200,000 our blocks of artworks, if that wallet

1567
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:58,160
count increases dramatically, there may not be enough art for everybody.

1568
01:53:58,160 --> 01:54:01,680
And all of a sudden we're at a deficit and all of a sudden prices start going up.

1569
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:08,960
We're not doing it for that reason, but we are trying to grow awareness of generative

1570
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:13,840
art, grow awareness of NFT digital art, scarcity, et cetera.

1571
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:18,880
And so it's just kind of an interesting balance and we're working through all of it.

1572
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,760
Okay, final question.

1573
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:21,960
I like this very much.

1574
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:23,720
I could have asked this myself.

1575
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:29,880
So Art Blocks is a platform, but a lot of people see Art Blocks as an art brand.

1576
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:31,120
How do you see that?

1577
01:54:31,120 --> 01:54:37,120
Is Art Blocks more like a museum or is it more like a launchpad?

1578
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:41,600
I don't know that trying to compartmentalize Art Blocks right now really makes a lot of

1579
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:42,600
sense.

1580
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:49,240
Like for example, Art Blocks started as an open platform for anybody that can create

1581
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:53,940
an algorithm to put code on chain and really if you could code a square pixel onto the

1582
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:58,600
screen and make it change with every mint, like we were happy to have you.

1583
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:00,240
And that has changed dramatically, right?

1584
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:04,960
Like there's just more demand for slots for releases than they are than there is demand

1585
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:10,520
for Art Blocks art works.

1586
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:14,960
What happened when we started screening is if you really think about it, we started

1587
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,960
following a little bit more of a gallery model.

1588
01:55:17,960 --> 01:55:19,840
And that was never the intention of Art Blocks, right?

1589
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:24,280
So in fact, you know, we started this exhibition center in Marfa, Texas, which is kind of in

1590
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:27,040
the middle of nowhere, but it's this beautiful place out west actually.

1591
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,320
I'm not to fly out there.

1592
01:55:28,320 --> 01:55:34,160
And part of the drive of this exhibition center was that there was nothing for sale.

1593
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,960
In fact, that's what's kind of cool about Art Blocks.

1594
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:37,240
There's really nothing for sale.

1595
01:55:37,240 --> 01:55:40,440
The only way to buy stuff is to go out on the website and mint stuff or you get something

1596
01:55:40,440 --> 01:55:43,560
on the secondary market, but you would never walk into an Art Blocks exhibition center

1597
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:48,720
and be like, see a price tag next to an artwork that's on the wall because there's no need

1598
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:52,040
for the exhibition center for that artwork to change hands.

1599
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:56,000
That's what the beauty is of decentralized exchanges.

1600
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,600
And I think that there's something really important about being an exhibition center

1601
01:56:00,600 --> 01:56:03,520
and not having something to sell.

1602
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,160
So, you know, the gallery has to sell art.

1603
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,240
We have to sell art.

1604
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:11,960
So maybe we are a gallery in that sense, but long term, what I'd like Art Blocks to be

1605
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:21,640
is like this place where artists become discovered because you know that the next ringer's,

1606
01:56:21,640 --> 01:56:30,200
Fadenza, you know, archetype is sitting out there in the head of a 13 year old that will

1607
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:35,160
learn to maybe even be inspired to learn creative coding and get involved with this because

1608
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:39,480
of the beauty of the things that are coming out of not just our blocks, but like FX hash

1609
01:56:39,480 --> 01:56:42,800
and all the other wonderful generative art platforms that are out there and they're going

1610
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:43,800
to be inspired by it.

1611
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:47,400
And that person in three or four years will refine this beautiful algorithm and be released

1612
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:54,600
and blow everybody's minds like, you know, we don't want to have to chase.

1613
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:59,240
We want to host the best generative art from the best gender artists in the world.

1614
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:05,760
But we also want to make sure that we create a wonderful home to release the best gender

1615
01:57:05,760 --> 01:57:06,760
of art.

1616
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:12,400
And so we don't know what the future of our blocks looks like in terms of a category.

1617
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:18,400
We do know that NFTs have been incredibly disruptive, not just from a financial perspective, but

1618
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,840
from like an understanding things perspective.

1619
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:26,520
NFTs have elevated global awareness and appreciation for digital art.

1620
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,640
Forget generative art for just one second.

1621
01:57:28,640 --> 01:57:33,720
Like digital art has been something that creators have been making for years and years and years

1622
01:57:33,720 --> 01:57:35,280
decades.

1623
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:40,120
And yeah, it's had recognition, but not nearly to the level of like, you know, oil on canvas

1624
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,280
and sculpture.

1625
01:57:41,280 --> 01:57:46,960
And I think we're seeing this like beautiful thing where digital art is having a renaissance.

1626
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:52,800
Generative art is part of that is like, you know, sharing that moment with digital art

1627
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:54,200
as a whole.

1628
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:01,240
And we don't know what it looks like when digital art gets to that level of appreciation

1629
01:58:01,240 --> 01:58:04,960
and acceptance as sculpture and oil on canvas.

1630
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:13,960
But what we do know is that people that own this art are incredibly proud to own the art.

1631
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:17,560
They're incredibly vocal about their ownership of the art.

1632
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,960
Some cases people might be pumping their bags.

1633
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,560
In some cases, and you see this on Twitter all the time.

1634
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:30,000
I've seen people transformed from pumping their bags to saying meaningful deep reflection

1635
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,800
things that come out of their mind as they look at artwork or as they see this artist's

1636
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,080
career expand.

1637
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:37,440
So we're just it's just it's just changing.

1638
01:58:37,440 --> 01:58:39,560
Everything's changing so fast.

1639
01:58:39,560 --> 01:58:42,960
There's no way to like compartmentalize this right now.

1640
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:47,560
We just need to do our best to support artists to support collectors to support our team.

1641
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:48,840
You know, this is a bear market.

1642
01:58:48,840 --> 01:58:54,760
It's really a weird time and you see people, major companies laying people off left and

1643
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:55,760
right.

1644
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,240
You see a lot of crypto organizations faltering and you realize like there's there's a lot

1645
01:59:00,240 --> 01:59:06,400
of things here that need to happen for Art Blocks to be an adult company like not just

1646
01:59:06,400 --> 01:59:11,960
this crypto startup, but like a real company that operates in the real world with real

1647
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,520
impact.

1648
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:18,800
And we're we're we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot by trying to make any decisions

1649
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:24,280
right now as to what we are as long as we just continue doing everything that we can

1650
01:59:24,280 --> 01:59:29,200
to host the best narrative art for the best artists in the world.

1651
01:59:29,200 --> 01:59:32,600
And yeah, pushing that pushing that envelope forward.

1652
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,960
Oh, no, I lost you.

1653
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:39,040
I can't hear you.

1654
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:40,040
Sorry.

1655
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,040
I wasn't.

1656
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:44,840
So I was just saying that this was fascinating.

1657
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:47,640
I really enjoyed your discussion with six five to nine.

1658
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:51,920
I really enjoyed this session and I'm sure our students did too.

1659
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:54,080
So thank you very much for for being here.

1660
01:59:54,080 --> 01:59:57,320
Ladies and gentlemen, Eric snow throw.

1661
01:59:57,320 --> 01:59:58,320
Thank you.

1662
01:59:58,320 --> 01:59:59,640
Thank you so much for having me.

1663
01:59:59,640 --> 02:00:01,840
Thanks for following the course everybody.

1664
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,800
This is pretty revolutionary in and of itself.

1665
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:06,240
So congratulations to everyone that's there listening.

1666
02:00:06,240 --> 02:00:07,240
It's cool.

1667
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:08,240
Thank you.

1668
02:00:08,240 --> 02:00:11,040
Bye bye.
