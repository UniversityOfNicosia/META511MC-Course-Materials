00:00.000 --> 00:20.320
Hello and good evening.

00:20.320 --> 00:27.040
Thank you everyone for joining us for this conversation with three of the leading artists

00:27.040 --> 00:30.240
in the NFT space about generative art.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
My name is Anika.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.240
I'm the moderator.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.240
I'm a writer.

00:33.240 --> 00:41.720
Yeah, I started by writing about social media and art and ended up with NFTs.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.480
And yeah, we have three artists here with us tonight.

00:44.480 --> 00:46.480
Helena, Matt, I, Xcels.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.640
I, all of you are very familiar with the names, the faces and their work.

00:51.640 --> 00:57.000
Yeah, as just mentioned prior, there are three of the leading artists in this space.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.520
They have created work before NFTs.

00:59.520 --> 01:04.600
They created NFTs during the hype or created generative art before the hype.

01:04.600 --> 01:07.280
They lived through the hype and now they're still here.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.560
So I'm very honored that all three of us are with us tonight.

01:11.560 --> 01:16.440
And the first thing I would like to speak with you about because I sit in a gyro space

01:16.440 --> 01:18.880
right now, which we open in December.

01:18.880 --> 01:22.400
It's one of the main streets in Berlin.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.080
It's a collaboration with VIRS.

01:25.080 --> 01:28.680
We named a generative abstraction and it's quite interesting because a lot of people

01:28.680 --> 01:33.520
just walk by and come in and the show is titled generative abstraction.

01:33.520 --> 01:41.040
And in your, I mean, for this talk, it just says generative artists.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.120
And yeah, when people come in here, it's basically people who are not familiar really with NFTs

01:46.120 --> 01:48.000
and what generative art is.

01:48.000 --> 01:55.040
So how do you explain to people who are not part of the NFT space what you actually do?

01:55.040 --> 02:02.040
Who would like to start?

02:02.040 --> 02:05.040
I could start.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.040
Okay, Matt, go ahead.

02:08.040 --> 02:15.800
Yeah, it's a funny thing to explain because I'll answer this in the context of a couple

02:15.800 --> 02:23.240
of years ago before everything sort of changed a little bit with NFTs and blockchain and

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
crypto and everything.

02:24.240 --> 02:30.200
But even then it was very difficult to explain because first you kind of have to explain

02:30.200 --> 02:34.520
that you're creating art with a computer and then you have to explain you're creating

02:34.520 --> 02:37.240
art with code quite often.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.360
And then people tend to be like, how do you make art with code and then you have to kind

02:41.360 --> 02:49.240
of explain how you can use code to draw lines or to make shapes or sounds or something.

02:49.240 --> 02:54.960
And it becomes this like 20 minute long discussion just to get to the basics of it.

02:54.960 --> 03:01.720
So sometimes nowadays I'll quite often just say artist or I'll just say digital artist

03:01.720 --> 03:10.760
or computer artist because generative art is sort of a can of worms for a lot of discussions.

03:10.760 --> 03:15.400
And more recently with crypto and NFT, it's also changed again.

03:15.400 --> 03:21.520
It's sometimes depending on who you're chatting with, if they are familiar with NFTs and crypto

03:21.520 --> 03:27.320
and you say you're a generative artist, no matter whether you do or do not engage with

03:27.320 --> 03:34.120
NFTs, sometimes their first reaction is, oh, all you do is NFTs or is that like what

03:34.120 --> 03:35.880
you do now?

03:35.880 --> 03:39.240
And there's a whole world of generative art outside of that as well.

03:39.240 --> 03:48.280
So it's sort of, it has been a tricky thing to sort of wrap up in a short conversational

03:48.280 --> 03:50.400
small talk sort of way.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.440
And it's even more complicated now I would say.

03:52.440 --> 03:58.200
But when you do go into this with some people that are not familiar, they quite often they're

03:58.200 --> 04:02.000
really sort of stunned or they're like surprised by it.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.320
A lot of people, they know what code is and they know what some of these kind of ideas

04:08.320 --> 04:11.800
are and they can put it together once somebody explains it to them and they can say, well,

04:11.800 --> 04:13.600
that's kind of cool.

04:13.600 --> 04:14.600
Yeah.

04:14.600 --> 04:19.520
I bet there's more kind of words.

04:19.520 --> 04:23.560
As soon as you mentioned the word NFTs and everyone's like, oh, there's still a thing

04:23.560 --> 04:24.560
I thought they are dead.

04:24.560 --> 04:30.360
Then you have the next 30 minute conversation going.

04:30.360 --> 04:31.360
Thank you.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.080
Who would like to speak next?

04:34.080 --> 04:36.040
Hitzel or Helena?

04:36.040 --> 04:43.040
Yeah, I can add a little bit because I'm sort of on the GSN territory because I was

04:43.040 --> 04:49.400
lumped, well, still lumped with AI art, which is another kind of warm.

04:49.400 --> 04:55.840
But I consider myself more and more generative artists this day because like Matt said, I

04:55.840 --> 05:01.440
mean, at the end of the day, like people who work with the code who write their own code

05:01.440 --> 05:08.800
who in case of AI make their own data sets or tweak their own models, that basically

05:08.800 --> 05:13.160
makes us kind of like generative slash computational artists.

05:13.160 --> 05:17.480
And that's the category I like to put myself in.

05:17.480 --> 05:30.240
I think something interesting has happened with AI in recent months with like mid-journey

05:30.240 --> 05:37.040
and Dolly and stuff is that the definition of like an AI artist that works with AI has

05:37.040 --> 05:40.160
also sort of been shifted in this public perception.

05:40.160 --> 05:46.600
Yeah, the territory of AI art was claimed by the prompt base AI, but that's not the

05:46.600 --> 05:49.240
kind of like story.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.040
Yeah.

05:51.040 --> 06:01.800
Yeah, my case, I think is tiny bit more complicated when it comes to explaining why the art with

06:01.800 --> 06:05.880
computers, there's nobody does it in my country.

06:05.880 --> 06:13.440
I'm like one of the only ones like I can count five artists that works with computers to

06:13.440 --> 06:15.360
create art in my country.

06:15.360 --> 06:26.360
And this is like a tiny town where only three million people and I've gone to a few talks

06:26.360 --> 06:32.120
and I think people can get that this is another tool.

06:32.120 --> 06:40.720
I've tried my best to simplify the terms and just demonstrate that I can create with

06:40.720 --> 06:50.080
emotion and with sticks and stones and generative art or the medium which is social signer in

06:50.080 --> 06:51.720
my case.

06:51.720 --> 07:02.720
It's just another way for me to find a way to express just like others do with dance

07:02.720 --> 07:09.640
and music, which is more predominant and kind of one.

07:09.640 --> 07:27.080
I like to say that I like to replicate or simulate what's around me using math and using

07:27.080 --> 07:36.240
just in general like geometry or the errors that you can find in code create something

07:36.240 --> 07:49.080
different just to say I found to express what is generative art and what I do.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.080
Thank you.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.160
We had the conversation more often that you said in your country that's very few artists

07:55.160 --> 08:01.240
who actually work with code and in the NFT space.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.440
This question goes again to all three of us.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.320
How did you or when did you know you would like to become an artist or that you are an

08:07.320 --> 08:15.560
artist and then how did you get to the part ways that working with code?

08:15.560 --> 08:24.200
Well, I started with photography back when I was living in Toronto.

08:24.200 --> 08:30.640
I was there doing different jobs like working in as a dot walker.

08:30.640 --> 08:36.520
I work in a pixel place and in Shisha Varr like so many places.

08:36.520 --> 08:44.000
But I really love just going for a walk and taking photos of buildings or like how the

08:44.000 --> 08:49.920
lights will come through like structures and even from the trees.

08:49.920 --> 08:58.800
I think I've always been in love with being fascinated with how light goes into tiny places

08:58.800 --> 09:02.560
and where you can imagine.

09:02.560 --> 09:06.320
I started looking for programs to study.

09:06.320 --> 09:10.000
I went through architectural technology.

09:10.000 --> 09:16.880
I was really interested in urban planning partly because my partner at the time was studying

09:16.880 --> 09:27.160
that and I used to sneak in to her classes and being really just about fixing issues that

09:27.160 --> 09:34.960
can help people live in a better way like with landscape design or you know all of this

09:34.960 --> 09:41.800
like subjects that this career includes.

09:41.800 --> 09:49.040
That career was really expensive so I changed to I try to find other ways to learn about

09:49.040 --> 10:00.920
computer and design, designing plans and like buildings and I look for programs in this

10:00.920 --> 10:09.320
online courses and I found computer science and I just I couldn't stop reading about it

10:09.320 --> 10:15.480
and learning how colors can contain information.

10:15.480 --> 10:23.360
And that information can be used to create other things including the tools that we used

10:23.360 --> 10:27.480
to make art.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.480
So I was really inspired.

10:28.480 --> 10:41.240
I was just really trying to become someone else and being able to come back to my country

10:41.240 --> 10:43.800
with something.

10:43.800 --> 10:52.640
So it was a mix of photography, architecture, love and like just practice.

10:52.640 --> 11:01.600
I used to read a lot even if I wasn't taking the course because they were still really

11:01.600 --> 11:03.240
expensive.

11:03.240 --> 11:13.600
I haven't finished school but I think I taught myself how to do things and how to manage

11:13.600 --> 11:14.920
them.

11:14.920 --> 11:23.120
I think what made me fall in love with it the most was the lack of control I had over what

11:23.120 --> 11:27.680
I was doing.

11:27.680 --> 11:34.080
I used to imagine like cities within like all of this patterns that were like at first glance

11:34.080 --> 11:39.840
you think it's like nothing is rubbish but if you look at it with imagination like you

11:39.840 --> 11:46.680
can see tiny nations or cities and were like just something else.

11:46.680 --> 11:56.040
So I felt like oh okay so this is like this is my thing like seeing things through abstraction.

11:56.040 --> 12:01.280
So that's part of like how I started.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.280
Thank you for sharing your story.

12:03.280 --> 12:10.640
I would like to share the story next with us.

12:10.640 --> 12:18.280
I've been a professional software developer for a long time but also more lighted in art

12:18.280 --> 12:26.120
and with like computational art I started accidentally in a sense that at work I was

12:26.120 --> 12:33.000
doing some stuff with neural networks and then I decided to try it with my own art.

12:33.000 --> 12:42.320
So I was lucky enough that I had like heaps of digital photographs from my food styling

12:42.320 --> 12:50.720
moonlighting so I used them to kind of train networks, neural networks from scratch and

12:50.720 --> 12:56.400
like Excel said I mean it's kind of fascinating when from something like photography you get

12:56.400 --> 13:05.360
into something else and actually like I pivoted to the artist's career more than five years

13:05.360 --> 13:13.680
ago because I was totally fascinated by the how AI and neural network can elevate your

13:13.680 --> 13:16.080
artistic voice in a sense.

13:16.080 --> 13:33.640
I never got it with the analog art to be honest.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.800
Sorry I just wanted to ask one question.

13:36.800 --> 13:39.400
Did you just say you're not good with analog art?

13:39.400 --> 13:47.320
No, it's not like I'm good or not good but it's just like too mainstream to average.

13:47.320 --> 13:54.000
I wanted, I mean I like to do like unique interesting stuff and like in watercolor you

13:54.000 --> 13:56.400
basically it's like hard to do it.

13:56.400 --> 14:04.040
So I mean I hit the artistic book at some point and AI actually helped me to kind of like

14:04.040 --> 14:10.280
break through.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.960
Okay, thank you sorry for interrupting.

14:15.960 --> 14:21.240
I just was curious because sometimes if people come by and they don't know about NFTs and

14:21.240 --> 14:26.840
then the question is always like yeah do they have a background in like physical art or

14:26.840 --> 14:31.160
did they start straight away with code because it's so hard for people who are not familiar

14:31.160 --> 14:35.320
with artists using the digital space to imagine that you start out with code.

14:35.320 --> 14:39.320
That's also why I ask you how did you get started as an artist.

14:39.320 --> 14:44.800
Many artists say, many artists say and that's always my first question in interview.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.120
When did you know you are an artist or would you like to become an artist?

14:48.120 --> 14:55.440
Any artist say I love drawing as a kid and that's what I like to do in my life.

14:55.440 --> 15:00.240
I mean I was good at drawing but I was like not thinking I would want to become an artist

15:00.240 --> 15:04.640
so I thought maybe that's different for artists and that's maybe why I'm not an artist because

15:04.640 --> 15:08.560
I didn't think that as a kid but I don't know.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.000
Matt?

15:10.000 --> 15:15.440
I mean when I was a kid I loved drawing but I don't know if I had the sole vision of like

15:15.440 --> 15:20.800
I'm going to be an artist in my life kind of thing but also I think part of that was just

15:20.800 --> 15:25.480
you know you're not really quite often.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.880
It's not always seen as like something that you could do like you know people are like

15:29.880 --> 15:35.600
okay here's the list of possible jobs that you should look into and very rarely is digital

15:35.600 --> 15:39.040
artists using code ever on there.

15:39.040 --> 15:45.240
So I think one of the things like for me at least here's my sort of little thing is I

15:45.240 --> 15:53.280
think it was around 2014 or so that I started to learn about these kind of ideas of generative

15:53.280 --> 15:54.280
art.

15:54.280 --> 16:01.200
I think at the time was like really familiar with the whole sort of history of things but

16:01.200 --> 16:07.840
I was just starting to use code for something that was more artistic than what I had done

16:07.840 --> 16:10.720
before and I really like kind of fell in love with that.

16:10.720 --> 16:18.680
I just wanted to use the skills I was learning with code and JavaScript and graphics programming

16:18.680 --> 16:27.200
and apply those to just making art because before that I had this kind of winding path

16:27.200 --> 16:34.600
where in university I studied film and media thinking you know really something to do with

16:34.600 --> 16:41.800
film would be really interesting but it kind of I came to realize it's not really an easy

16:41.800 --> 16:44.000
career.

16:44.000 --> 16:49.440
It's a lot of struggling, it's a lot of just brutal hours and I didn't really want to go

16:49.440 --> 16:56.440
through some of that and at the end of it I felt like a lot of the work I was learning

16:56.440 --> 17:03.200
to do in film was not always kind of you know my own and so I like doing these little projects

17:03.200 --> 17:07.800
even at university I was just doing code and I was like doing little games and little graphical

17:07.800 --> 17:15.080
toys and things like that with either Java at the time or sometimes using flash using

17:15.080 --> 17:22.120
ActionScript and yeah I guess it wasn't until that point in 2014 after having worked with

17:22.120 --> 17:28.000
code for you know doing web development type thing, web design type things I started to

17:28.000 --> 17:33.560
realize like I could actually use code to just make art and it wasn't really a clear

17:33.560 --> 17:37.720
path at the moment but like I was starting to think about it and then over the course

17:37.720 --> 17:44.280
of several years I just continued to try and move towards that but really it wasn't until

17:44.280 --> 17:50.000
probably a few years ago that I started calling myself an artist and saying you know when

17:50.000 --> 17:54.240
people ask me what I'm doing or if I'm going to some event and they're like you have to

17:54.240 --> 17:59.200
put your job title in the badge or something like that it's like that's when I was finally

17:59.200 --> 18:05.640
going to be okay this is what I want to do in life I just want to make art with code and

18:05.640 --> 18:11.720
so I can start to put that on the event badge that says matilary artist and it's funny how

18:11.720 --> 18:18.080
a light switches when you tell people that and when you tell yourself that you just sort

18:18.080 --> 18:23.920
of you fall into it a bit more naturally so that was sort of yeah that was a turning

18:23.920 --> 18:30.440
point I don't know the timing but a few years ago and since then I've just been now like

18:30.440 --> 18:35.280
getting more and more like getting you know more and more entrenched into that sort of

18:35.280 --> 18:44.200
idea of just making art and thankfully because of the NFT and crypto space it's really become

18:44.200 --> 18:51.960
you know something where we a lot of artists we don't need to as much rely on some of the

18:51.960 --> 18:57.040
you know web development web design type work that we were really focused on a lot in the

18:57.040 --> 19:04.440
past now a lot of us can just make art and focus on that so yeah it's been an interesting

19:04.440 --> 19:08.080
journey there.

19:08.080 --> 19:16.880
And has your approach to making art changed due to NFTs I mean you've just mentioned it

19:16.880 --> 19:22.840
NFTs have been life-changing for many artists because prior many of the artists like who

19:22.840 --> 19:28.880
we know today and are really big in the NFT space and have creative work that's historically

19:28.880 --> 19:36.320
relevant they have prior work is at agencies or have been doing web development or yeah

19:36.320 --> 19:42.760
just had to have a job that helped them pay their rent and now there's NFTs and they're

19:42.760 --> 19:48.920
sold by a marketplaces or platforms and even if it's called an exhibition in most cases

19:48.920 --> 19:55.760
you know your work is mostly going to be seen on a website or on a smartphone so has that

19:55.760 --> 20:00.320
change from what you've done prior creating work and the next step because with bright

20:00.320 --> 20:09.400
moments or art blocks or yeah we now see many exhibitions happening so is that a difference

20:09.400 --> 20:14.280
if you know okay you create a work that's mainly going to be seen online to okay I'm

20:14.280 --> 20:20.720
creating work maybe immersive for an exhibition space is that a approach to you?

20:20.720 --> 20:27.400
Yeah I think it's changed a lot of things in just the ways that I think we are all sort

20:27.400 --> 20:34.480
of thinking about work a little bit so like even something like FX hash and I think a

20:34.480 --> 20:41.520
platform like FX hash has sort of affected the way that a lot of generative artists are approaching

20:41.520 --> 20:48.240
their work there's this sort of you know constant chatter about long-form generative art whereas

20:48.240 --> 20:53.640
most of us were not really chatting about that or thinking about that type of workflow

20:53.640 --> 21:01.200
where you spend months and months and months on a single script and that's your project

21:01.200 --> 21:05.400
like a lot of us would have just been doing more like sketching with code and we would

21:05.400 --> 21:10.720
have just been sort of sketching posting on Twitter posting on Instagram and then doing

21:10.720 --> 21:17.040
a whole new sketch and not really doing anything with our work except you'd be posted and

21:17.040 --> 21:22.200
then it just disappears and you know after it gets a few likes the next day it's kind

21:22.200 --> 21:28.200
of gone and you're kind of forced to do more and like bring more content to these feeds

21:28.200 --> 21:34.640
like Twitter or Instagram and that's kind of your you know way that's like what you're

21:34.640 --> 21:42.120
forced to do in this sort of you know pre NFT type of generative artists posting on the

21:42.120 --> 21:46.280
web posting on social media that's how at least I was feeling and I think some others

21:46.280 --> 21:52.400
might have felt similar whereas now there's this kind of different workflow that exists

21:52.400 --> 21:59.840
where we can really work towards a singular sort of vision or a singular idea or concept

21:59.840 --> 22:05.680
or project and we cracked that and we build that out and at the end of it I mean it's

22:05.680 --> 22:09.040
not you know guaranteed that it's going to do well or anything like that but at the

22:09.040 --> 22:13.120
end of it there is something that you can release to the world that is more than just

22:13.120 --> 22:18.480
a Twitter post that you know will get you 20 likes or something it might be an FX hash

22:18.480 --> 22:25.800
post that gets you 20 Tezos but that's I mean 20 Tezos is not much but it's hell of a lot

22:25.800 --> 22:32.200
better than just 20 likes and it's the kind of it's a different mindset there is like

22:32.200 --> 22:38.560
instead of just posting for the social media for it to be disappeared you're posting on

22:38.560 --> 22:43.920
these blockchains that are kind of permanent in a way and a lot of the work that you know

22:43.920 --> 22:51.680
we have minted so far even many months later it's still being it's still very relevant

22:51.680 --> 22:57.840
like it's it's amazing to see how that's changed as well like I don't really see some

22:57.840 --> 23:06.600
of the you know pre-2021 generative harp really coming up over and over again in discussions

23:06.600 --> 23:11.960
and things except for maybe like the really historical things whereas things that have

23:11.960 --> 23:19.240
been minted there's this like kind of constant sharing of them and constant like revival

23:19.240 --> 23:24.240
of them it's there's something to do with maybe the stewardship of them people want

23:24.240 --> 23:29.640
to share what they've you know purchased and things like that whereas you know nobody's

23:29.640 --> 23:36.680
re-sharing my like Twitter post from five years ago so it's just it's an interesting

23:36.680 --> 23:43.800
new way of putting out this digital art in the world in a way that you know we were sort

23:43.800 --> 23:48.400
of doing when whenever we would make a print or something like that we would put that that

23:48.400 --> 23:51.640
thing out into the world and we would like give it to somebody and they would hold it

23:51.640 --> 23:57.080
and cherish it and maybe share it with others but you know that's a physical way of distributing

23:57.080 --> 24:04.480
work and now with NFTs we have this more digital or like digitally native way of distributing

24:04.480 --> 24:10.040
work which is just ties a little bit more elegantly than saying oh the only way I can distribute

24:10.040 --> 24:15.520
my work is as print which doesn't really make sense if you're a completely digital artist

24:15.520 --> 24:20.320
it feels weird to force digital artists to work with a physical medium if they don't

24:20.320 --> 24:26.560
want to kind of thing or if they don't feel it suits the work.

24:26.560 --> 24:33.240
Thank you one quick thing for attendees you can ask your questions to the artists via

24:33.240 --> 24:40.680
the hashtag on Twitter NFT Q&A or you can ask questions via discourse discourse we're

24:40.680 --> 24:44.720
all happy to answer your questions.

24:44.720 --> 24:49.040
I'll show you back I don't know if you've heard the question I guess you had a website

24:49.040 --> 24:50.040
issues.

24:50.040 --> 24:57.880
Yeah I just dropped for a second I think you have an idea of like the question but could

24:57.880 --> 25:05.880
you repeat so the question was because Matt prior mentioned that his life has changed

25:05.880 --> 25:11.920
or for many artists through NFTs because prior many of you worked at agencies or web developers

25:11.920 --> 25:18.040
and then I was like and has creating work changed for you you first then started creating

25:18.040 --> 25:25.520
work to be seen and shared and sold on marketplaces and platforms and now after the pandemic

25:25.520 --> 25:31.080
we see more and more exhibitions happening immersive shows has it also now changed your

25:31.080 --> 25:35.320
way of making art when you approach a project do you do it differently when you know okay

25:35.320 --> 25:40.520
it's going to mainly live online or it's going to be in an exhibition and maybe even going

25:40.520 --> 25:42.520
to be immersive.

25:42.520 --> 25:59.240
I definitely have changed my life completely so where do I begin I think like every day

25:59.240 --> 26:07.040
I wake up around 5 a.m. and I think I start I open up my program so once I was using

26:07.040 --> 26:15.600
the day before I create something but before we had another motivation like Matt was saying

26:15.600 --> 26:20.040
that before we're just sharing online and we didn't know what to do with all that work

26:20.040 --> 26:28.280
and people were reacting to it and that was it but now we are able to create more time

26:28.280 --> 26:40.960
and space to be creative by generating enough income to have all the space to experiment

26:40.960 --> 26:49.720
to create projects to have the opportunity to be in galleries and now museums and I feel

26:49.720 --> 26:56.920
that that's not only that wasn't my dream before I wasn't dreaming on being in a museum

26:56.920 --> 27:01.640
when I started to interact with art it was like that's impossible I wasn't even thinking

27:01.640 --> 27:08.480
about selling it I didn't even create it like print works or anything like that I was just

27:08.480 --> 27:17.040
sharing online because I don't know I just wanted to get like an open diary a way to

27:17.040 --> 27:25.880
express another language and that has been my way ever since I started with this in

27:25.880 --> 27:38.720
2015. I also see it as a this is like a game an online game where a lot of people like

27:38.720 --> 27:46.360
came into the launch of the game and like it was like the first few months of hype but

27:46.360 --> 27:56.800
this existed before all of this hype like people were working on programs and on platforms

27:56.800 --> 28:10.800
and ways to archive not only art but anything like any data on Shane and I think like the

28:10.800 --> 28:21.440
game was on beta and then it switched to like a massive audience and this game has rewards

28:21.440 --> 28:29.400
and items and people that love to collect things and put them in their house like if

28:29.400 --> 28:34.560
and I think most people that are still in this are people that like games and that like

28:34.560 --> 28:44.360
the the way it works like you create a community you walk around the server or the town and

28:44.360 --> 28:53.240
you start just like what's what's new in it what's the new update but there's people

28:53.240 --> 29:04.080
that are not in the game obviously those are that are refused to or not acknowledge but

29:04.080 --> 29:08.720
to take the time to understand what happens in this game and there's some others that

29:08.720 --> 29:19.800
are front end and they want to keep growing the space or what I would call like the server

29:19.800 --> 29:28.000
where we live we're still a really small community in a sense.

29:28.000 --> 29:40.080
So I think that's what keeps me not only motivated but it's more open to understanding

29:40.080 --> 29:50.160
the dynamics so many things have changed if you notice like there's artists that have

29:50.160 --> 29:59.960
more opportunities than others and I'm hopeful that by institutions or like the museums that

29:59.960 --> 30:06.520
are approaching us or universities creating this venue is where we can talk about this

30:06.520 --> 30:16.320
as a similar class it will attract more people into it and it will become more natural not

30:16.320 --> 30:25.360
just an exclusive game where only a few have access to it.

30:25.360 --> 30:37.760
That's the way like it had changed my family's life to like in real life I was just depending

30:37.760 --> 30:44.480
on my mom and my brother for a long time because my mind could only focus on art and

30:44.480 --> 30:46.640
I wasn't doing anything else.

30:46.640 --> 30:53.960
I did work for a long time in tech support and you know so were hardware issues but I

30:53.960 --> 30:59.460
never used a computer to create art and when I started doing it I couldn't stop and I

30:59.460 --> 31:06.960
thanks to my family I was able to have the time to do this so yeah NFTs and the opportunities

31:06.960 --> 31:13.680
that it opened up changed everything for me I always say it I'm always trying to like

31:13.680 --> 31:21.320
come back and show gratitude because I didn't do it alone I wouldn't be here if it wasn't

31:21.320 --> 31:34.680
for other people that are really interested in this and that wants to keep it going.

31:34.680 --> 31:40.440
Thank you that's great to hear that NFTs really helped support you and your family

31:40.440 --> 31:46.240
and yeah I think that's actually the best that could happen and I find it really interesting

31:46.240 --> 31:51.880
that you said well you didn't even think about being in a museum and now institutions

31:51.880 --> 31:55.080
approach you and I think that's very beautiful.

31:55.080 --> 31:59.480
Helena how about you?

31:59.480 --> 32:07.280
It's in terms of how NFT kind of changed my life I think like from the artistic perspective

32:07.280 --> 32:15.200
it's mostly because I could stop being bucketed in the straight eye artist bucket I became

32:15.200 --> 32:22.560
more kind of like digital artist and what it started very fruitful period in my art

32:22.560 --> 32:31.240
making which I call post again is more post the I.R. where I kind of like could mix various

32:31.240 --> 32:38.560
kind of like styles and things and people kind of responded to it and nobody kind of

32:38.560 --> 32:45.600
required when I see the quite over 10 FTS nobody required for me making straight the

32:45.600 --> 32:53.280
eye art so it kind of gave me like freedom and to kind of break through and to new angles

32:53.280 --> 32:59.600
in my creativity so because from the money perspective to be honest I would have made

32:59.600 --> 33:07.000
more money being a software consulting can be continuing to do this stuff so but yeah

33:07.000 --> 33:13.520
I mean like Kickshail said when you start to making art you basically it's very hard

33:13.520 --> 33:19.160
to switch back and forth I did it but but it's like for a long time but it's really

33:19.160 --> 33:28.200
kind of hard to do but these days you basically kind of think about stuff is like stuff you

33:28.200 --> 33:34.240
making new projects pretty much all the time and it helps when you have like several streams

33:34.240 --> 33:41.000
because I'm not only like an artist I do a lot of like physical work like books and

33:41.000 --> 33:46.000
stuff and I think it's very helpful like for artists not to be sort of like straight

33:46.000 --> 33:56.080
and if it is all because I mean I think at least like in my case you need to have few

33:56.080 --> 34:01.640
projects because maybe you failed in one but you will succeed in another one like selling

34:01.640 --> 34:09.920
the books or making the books so it keeps you busy and keeps your creativity diversified

34:09.920 --> 34:17.040
in a sense so because yeah I think like again I mean people can call themselves so whatever

34:17.040 --> 34:23.800
but calling yourself and then the tea artist I think it's kind of limiting being an artist

34:23.800 --> 34:31.160
and like make art try different things like stick with certain stuff but yeah I mean it

34:31.160 --> 34:37.880
really kind of helpful to think this way and as you've just mentioned you work with AI

34:37.880 --> 34:43.280
and I think over the past let's say six months we have seen a lot happening when it comes

34:43.280 --> 34:51.480
to AI and artists or even non-artists using AI do you feel threatened by new technology

34:51.480 --> 35:00.920
no I mean new technology kind of like I am using this technology and in a sense I think

35:00.920 --> 35:09.880
like being a devil's advocate or kind of like contrarian I feel kind of like working with

35:09.880 --> 35:16.720
GANS it's almost like working with obsolete technology and I welcome it because the at

35:16.720 --> 35:27.000
the end of the day you need to do whatever kind of like makes you happy which makes interesting

35:27.000 --> 35:32.400
things I mean technology is just like the tool I mean people you can use prompt based

35:32.400 --> 35:38.160
AI you can use GANS you can use whatever like deep dream I mean as long as you kind of

35:38.160 --> 35:47.000
create stuff that satisfies you and satisfies your audience that's what it is and artists

35:47.000 --> 35:52.440
is basically a very kind of like loose definition if you call yourself the artist you're the

35:52.440 --> 35:53.440
artist.

35:53.440 --> 36:07.320
I mean what I'm oh sorry no go ahead I just wanted you know at the beginning of like

36:07.320 --> 36:26.200
the wave of generative art that's saying I think it was 10,000,000,000,000 till 20,000

36:26.200 --> 36:28.480
exploded but I think at the beginning people were doing a lot of perling noise circles

36:28.480 --> 36:37.400
like it was just you can tell like they were just using repurposing someone else's like

36:37.400 --> 36:44.280
projects and I think it's the same with AI like at the beginning you see a lot of like

36:44.280 --> 36:51.480
really beautiful art but if you still if you see the same over and over again you can start

36:51.480 --> 37:04.680
like realizing that like what's actually something that's out of the box that's different that

37:04.680 --> 37:11.080
comes from an artist's mind you start curating that so I don't think we should be afraid

37:11.080 --> 37:20.800
of like all this wave of new artists that use AI to create art like just like have to find

37:20.800 --> 37:28.360
artists like Helena like create things that are really unique and comes from a very personal

37:28.360 --> 37:35.200
place and like math and like many others so it's just about curation we're always going

37:35.200 --> 37:42.560
to need curation no matter what comes new.

37:42.560 --> 37:50.320
I mean also especially the three of you you all have found your voice and a signature

37:50.320 --> 37:55.120
style might be the wrong word but I mean looking at your work it's quite clear it's coming

37:55.120 --> 38:03.240
from you and I just got questions from the audience and one of the questions I always

38:03.240 --> 38:08.720
also ask myself because I find it generous out I find really interesting I find it fascinating

38:08.720 --> 38:13.520
like what Leander Hadswig and Richard Nadler have done for example with the Richter piece

38:13.520 --> 38:20.320
you know that it's live running and I think yeah many people who started start collecting

38:20.320 --> 38:27.040
or many younger artists who work with I don't know traditional medium think about well what

38:27.040 --> 38:34.880
is a good way if you would like to start work with code or become generative artist and

38:34.880 --> 38:40.400
I asked other artists to question myself well would I have a chance to learn coding these

38:40.400 --> 38:44.280
day and someone like Travis Smalley the artist was doing the pixer rock set it took him like

38:44.280 --> 38:47.960
five years and he basically taught himself how to code and some artists say to me it's

38:47.960 --> 38:54.160
totally impossible don't even try it so what's your answer if someone says well how could

38:54.160 --> 38:58.800
I get started even if I'm just interested in learning how to code and don't have the

38:58.800 --> 39:03.840
goal of becoming an artist.

39:03.840 --> 39:13.800
You might get easier soon with all the chat GPT and AI tools like GitHub co-pilot and

39:13.800 --> 39:22.240
things I think as those things continue to develop it will become easier and easier to

39:22.240 --> 39:30.800
use code for creating things and at a certain point it will maybe change where you know

39:30.800 --> 39:38.160
the next wave of generative artists won't be really writing code by hand so much maybe

39:38.160 --> 39:47.680
not maybe I don't know but maybe they'll be you know pulling on these AI systems to basically

39:47.680 --> 39:54.160
help them synthesize maybe synthesize images but maybe also synthesize programs or some

39:54.160 --> 40:03.360
sort of state machines or systems that then are used to drive some kind of our work but

40:03.360 --> 40:10.360
I guess yeah to answer the question very simple other than using AI systems and hoping they

40:10.360 --> 40:17.400
all continue to improve another way is just to do really simple things and I think simple

40:17.400 --> 40:23.280
things are kind of under appreciated because there's this kind of constant drive to focus

40:23.280 --> 40:30.200
on just the visual aesthetic and visual complexity and detail and things like that but I mean

40:30.200 --> 40:38.680
simple things are kind of beautiful as well like Elsworth Kelly type shapes or of course

40:38.680 --> 40:44.920
you know I'm always referencing solo it because the work is very simple and it's actually

40:44.920 --> 40:50.960
something that is quite good for people that are kind of new to this to learn because

40:50.960 --> 40:56.600
it's not like okay you need to implement like a crazy cellular autonomous type thing it's

40:56.600 --> 41:01.000
something simpler and I know it's like the classic everyone talks about solo it type

41:01.000 --> 41:09.080
thing but it is you know when you're using something as simple as a line or okay I have

41:09.080 --> 41:14.600
a rectangle to draw because I don't want to spend five years learning how to code these

41:14.600 --> 41:23.000
complex structures you know that's a source of inspiration so that's just my approach

41:23.000 --> 41:30.520
to getting people interested in this and getting people to begin with this but I also recognize

41:30.520 --> 41:35.880
that there's more than just solo it and then I know that's like a maybe contentious topic

41:35.880 --> 41:47.440
because it's such an overused reference in this space but yeah yeah and then if kind

41:47.440 --> 41:53.440
of like this a graphical geometrical stuff doesn't fascinate you or them maybe there

41:53.440 --> 41:59.600
is no reason to learn I mean it's like I think it's a certain class of people who gets attracted

41:59.600 --> 42:07.520
to generative art and like for me for example I came to know like processing and the cases

42:07.520 --> 42:16.680
work back in 2010 but it didn't stick I mean I tried I could do stuff but because I was

42:16.680 --> 42:21.800
a like professional social development it didn't work for me so that's why I kind of

42:21.800 --> 42:28.080
like who found my game in the eye which is another kind of like mathematical approach

42:28.080 --> 42:33.880
to art making or engineering so again find what you are for me and it's like there is

42:33.880 --> 42:40.960
no kind of requirement to do the generative art right if you go to the agency yeah just

42:40.960 --> 42:46.000
to follow up on that I mean there's others that are you know they like you're saying

42:46.000 --> 42:51.800
they're not into the geometric and maybe they're not also into the AI and so they end

42:51.800 --> 42:56.840
up going down a different path of like doing something analog but maybe leaving some sort

42:56.840 --> 43:02.440
of generative system into it whether it's a computational or not or maybe they're doing

43:02.440 --> 43:06.520
something you know with physical computing or with installation I think it's all sort

43:06.520 --> 43:14.600
of it's very all tied together and you might end up finding that you prefer one of these

43:14.600 --> 43:21.560
things over the other rather than just doing the sort of you know visual I don't know what

43:21.560 --> 43:27.480
have we defined these things but like the visual geometric abstraction type generative

43:27.480 --> 43:34.440
art as opposed to other areas that could also be described as generative art or computational

43:34.440 --> 43:39.080
art algorithmic art or whatever.

43:39.080 --> 43:49.960
Yeah for example I always wanted to create a game but and like something more complicated

43:49.960 --> 43:58.680
than it's a team and imagine that in a few years we can or less than that we can create

43:58.680 --> 44:05.840
like games on our own without the need of having like different kind of developers or

44:05.840 --> 44:11.080
a big team or a big company to do so.

44:11.080 --> 44:15.400
So those are the dreams.

44:15.400 --> 44:20.840
I think with technology like this we can we can dream more like instead of being negative

44:20.840 --> 44:28.080
negative about it we can think of way how to use it for good not just to you know just

44:28.080 --> 44:33.960
to make quick money or copy others or being cool but there's so much more you can do

44:33.960 --> 44:45.760
with it like research and like other fields will like exponentially get faster like instead

44:45.760 --> 44:53.520
of years of like studying into like let's say a molecule like it will take less than

44:53.520 --> 45:00.240
that and like there's so much so many uses for a side of art.

45:00.240 --> 45:06.720
So yeah I'm pro. What is what would you say as an artist when you look at generative projects

45:06.720 --> 45:12.400
of yourself and of other artists but it's what is a good project for you an interesting

45:12.400 --> 45:19.080
project for you from yourself you continue working on and then actually publish and yeah

45:19.080 --> 45:20.960
I guess that's the question.

45:20.960 --> 45:26.080
What is good generative art after you when it comes to your own art and then to what

45:26.080 --> 45:34.080
you collect or like our inspired by.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.560
I guess that's a tricky one right.

45:37.560 --> 45:44.760
There's I mean there's so many things where you see something and you just there's just

45:44.760 --> 45:51.600
some some attachment to it and it's very personal and you can't always explain why you like

45:51.600 --> 45:58.160
something and then there's other things where you might realize sort of that there's a lot

45:58.160 --> 46:06.320
of work that's gone into something but it might not speak to you and it's I think it's

46:06.320 --> 46:13.520
one of these tricky questions where it's like I don't know if I or anyone else is in

46:13.520 --> 46:18.920
a position to be like that is not art or that is good art or that is bad art or or whatever

46:18.920 --> 46:28.320
because I think it's just this it doesn't really seem to be a very effective thing and

46:28.320 --> 46:35.360
I know that people become art critics and they some some art critics will just spend

46:35.360 --> 46:44.560
a lot of their time focused on that question but it I don't know it's hard to say what's

46:44.560 --> 46:51.600
good maybe attending exhibitions is a good way and also kind of like looking maybe for

46:51.600 --> 46:57.440
clubs because I think like when two artists come together there is always something I

46:57.440 --> 47:04.080
mean almost certain something interesting comes up like exactly Berman and this creville

47:04.080 --> 47:10.600
each cover or myself with me three not to kind of like with myself on the shoulders

47:10.600 --> 47:16.360
as so I think I like collapse like especially for independent artists is like really interesting

47:16.360 --> 47:18.800
projects to look at.

47:18.800 --> 47:22.160
So I think I missed your question.

47:22.160 --> 47:24.080
I'll ask it again.

47:24.080 --> 47:28.280
My question was what is good generative art for you?

47:28.280 --> 47:34.640
How do you know what are criteria quality criteria when you look at other artists work

47:34.640 --> 47:38.360
and when you look at your own work when do you know well this is a project you continue

47:38.360 --> 47:42.400
working on yeah what is good for you what is interesting for you?

47:42.400 --> 47:45.400
Oh the next one issues again.

47:45.400 --> 47:56.200
Well we wait I could actually expand on that and I can just duck out when she's back but

47:56.200 --> 48:04.080
for me I mean it's changed a lot in the last five years maybe I'll just I'll let okay

48:04.080 --> 48:07.720
she's going in the notes so I'll just answer.

48:07.720 --> 48:12.360
But for me it's changed a lot in the last five years because originally when I was learning

48:12.360 --> 48:20.080
about generative art and and getting familiar with some of the sort of make ways of upcoming

48:20.080 --> 48:27.320
things in generative art I was really looking up to sometimes like the very technical stuff

48:27.320 --> 48:34.000
and I was like wow that's incredibly complex and like the way that this has been coded

48:34.000 --> 48:41.320
is incredibly complex and I think nowadays I'm sort of more looking up to like the conceptual

48:41.320 --> 48:49.960
stuff or the things that you know bring in outside maybe analog or bring in you know

48:49.960 --> 48:54.440
sort of story or bring in these these things outside of just the complexity of code or

48:54.440 --> 49:00.240
or the way that the sort of project was visually assembled and things like that so I don't

49:00.240 --> 49:05.880
know that's just one comment.

49:05.880 --> 49:06.880
Thank you.

49:06.880 --> 49:19.480
I trust that having heard the question or was that a her cut off right or not?

49:19.480 --> 49:26.160
Well I think people know that I was creating art online for a long time like in different

49:26.160 --> 49:30.200
pages and my own page.

49:30.200 --> 49:38.280
I just haven't a specific, not a specific but I just know what I like and I get obsessed

49:38.280 --> 49:39.280
with it.

49:39.280 --> 49:46.760
Like Matt says like sometimes when you are so obsessed or so into your own art you don't

49:46.760 --> 49:55.920
really look into judging others like it just let it exist because like there's you know

49:55.920 --> 49:59.680
different kind of trees out there.

49:59.680 --> 50:09.240
So it's but when it comes to curating I think a theory of colors is very important like

50:09.240 --> 50:15.040
the way you combine certain things, palettes, there's many generative artists that have

50:15.040 --> 50:25.880
created like resources like palettes, color palettes for others to use and sometimes that's

50:25.880 --> 50:33.400
you can see it around a lot like the same tones and colors and many many works but there's

50:33.400 --> 50:40.680
art is that finds a way to create it like use it in a different way even if it's the

50:40.680 --> 50:44.040
same palette that someone else shared.

50:44.040 --> 50:50.720
I think that's been the center of generative art for a long time too like we all share

50:50.720 --> 51:01.880
techniques and ways to do certain things and sometimes we find each other doing similar

51:01.880 --> 51:08.520
works because it's all comes from algorithm and that just exists.

51:08.520 --> 51:11.400
It's not something that someone invented.

51:11.400 --> 51:22.000
So someone did discover and well math has its way to exist in like different forms in

51:22.000 --> 51:27.880
nature and then in what we create.

51:27.880 --> 51:36.240
So I think finding something that is different is the difficult part of all this like just

51:36.240 --> 51:54.920
being able to trace back to everything you've seen before and understand.

51:54.920 --> 51:57.520
We lost Ixrels again.

51:57.520 --> 52:08.520
Yeah, I think we all agree that 16 minutes is how long we would like.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.800
Oh, she's back.

52:11.800 --> 52:14.440
We hear you again and see you again for it.

52:14.440 --> 52:16.800
Oh, no.

52:16.800 --> 52:17.800
Connection issues.

52:17.800 --> 52:26.400
Yeah, so my last question would be because we said 16 minutes.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.880
There's also questions from the audience.

52:28.880 --> 52:33.200
The future of generative art and AI art.

52:33.200 --> 52:40.240
I mean right now as all three of you also mentioned, we see a lot of sales but it seems

52:40.240 --> 52:42.440
like a smaller community.

52:42.440 --> 52:45.440
I think it feels like we all know each other.

52:45.440 --> 52:51.280
Just maybe from Twitter or Discord or many of us have met at this point in time I think.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.760
Yeah, and how do you see the future of the space and of generative art?

52:54.760 --> 52:57.360
I mean we've seen the topic and I'm about at MoMA right now.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.080
Oh, there she is.

52:59.080 --> 53:00.080
Back again.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.080
Hi.

53:01.080 --> 53:02.880
Another try and then our last question.

53:02.880 --> 53:08.280
I don't know if it's the internet or a server.

53:08.280 --> 53:11.200
A string yard.

53:11.200 --> 53:18.040
But yeah, where was I?

53:18.040 --> 53:29.160
I think as I was saying, you'll have this certain unique taste for art.

53:29.160 --> 53:38.360
For example, being at like really light colors, recently warm colors.

53:38.360 --> 53:42.000
Before I was very into black and white only.

53:42.000 --> 53:46.560
But at the same time I will create the same piece in different colors.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.440
But I wouldn't show it.

53:49.440 --> 53:59.520
Because I had this pattern of following same tones when I create a grid on my gallery,

53:59.520 --> 54:04.200
which has been my Instagram page for a long time.

54:04.200 --> 54:10.360
But yeah, it's just a matter of taste to discern and to turn out the art.

54:10.360 --> 54:19.720
The other day I saw this meme about how perfect and adult art was like a lava lamp.

54:19.720 --> 54:31.320
I just don't understand how you can reduce someone's creativity to just being part of

54:31.320 --> 54:33.920
a room or entertainment.

54:33.920 --> 54:38.480
There's so much more to it and so much work that goes behind.

54:38.480 --> 54:42.520
But it's just the same with the internet.

54:42.520 --> 54:48.280
You can find a lot of meaning in patterns that other people don't see or don't know

54:48.280 --> 54:53.840
how to use them to say something.

54:53.840 --> 55:03.480
I use the wave of the ocean, even photography or video or kinetic lines to express a lot.

55:03.480 --> 55:14.040
So yeah, I think the way to generate the art is for the curator to actually fall in love

55:14.040 --> 55:22.560
with what they're looking at and not just use as another object or another art to fill

55:22.560 --> 55:28.600
up a gallery or whatever tasks they need to do.

55:28.600 --> 55:34.760
For me, when you do everything with love, you can create a lot of magic.

55:34.760 --> 55:38.560
When you don't do it, then you realize, oh, I was like automatic.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.000
I was just acting like a robot.

55:41.000 --> 55:43.960
Which surprisingly is something I try not to do.

55:43.960 --> 55:54.880
I try to deep program myself all the time, one way or the other.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.080
We lost our grandmother, I think her son is close to finish.

55:58.080 --> 55:59.400
Great job.

55:59.400 --> 56:02.720
Would you like to add something?

56:02.720 --> 56:03.720
Oh, no.

56:03.720 --> 56:07.240
She's saying she's just like an end of sentence.

56:07.240 --> 56:08.240
Yeah.

56:08.240 --> 56:13.160
I mean, she comes back for answering the last question because she also just mentioned

56:13.160 --> 56:14.600
graphic anadol and yeah.

56:14.600 --> 56:19.400
I mean, I think it's excellent for the piece base and for everyone of us to see graphic

56:19.400 --> 56:21.200
anadol and normal.

56:21.200 --> 56:25.960
And yeah, one of the attendees asked the question, where do we see the future of generative

56:25.960 --> 56:33.520
art and I've just said prior, all of you also mentioned it sort of like it feels like

56:33.520 --> 56:36.240
a small space because we somehow all know each other.

56:36.240 --> 56:40.360
We have met in person or we know each other through Twitter or Discord.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.080
So what's your prediction for the future?

56:42.080 --> 56:44.400
Now, graphic anadol at MoMA.

56:44.400 --> 56:47.440
I know that it's less speaking with a lot of institutions.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.960
A lot of institutions have approached her.

56:49.960 --> 56:58.160
And institution and then just collected the two NFTs from Leander Hatzog and Richard Nautla.

56:58.160 --> 57:01.000
Gerhard and Richard are now in a museum collection.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.840
So we see more and more NFTs going in.

57:04.840 --> 57:07.520
Yeah, what's your prediction for the future?

57:07.520 --> 57:16.920
Or what needs to happen that we see the future you hope for this space?

57:16.920 --> 57:22.920
I could start, I guess.

57:22.920 --> 57:26.960
I think there's sort of two questions and two answers here.

57:26.960 --> 57:28.960
One of them is like, what's the future of NFTs?

57:28.960 --> 57:31.920
And one of them is like, what's the future of generative art?

57:31.920 --> 57:35.720
And I think they'll be both intertwined and linked in different ways.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.960
But they'll also have different futures.

57:37.960 --> 57:44.080
So the future, I think, of generative art is just sort of the continuation of it, except

57:44.080 --> 57:49.520
expanding since like, you know, whatever the 60s or whenever we can say that it started

57:49.520 --> 57:54.240
and just continuing to grow and expand in the public consciousness and hopefully grow

57:54.240 --> 58:01.000
and expand in sort of the collections of the world in a way so that now we're starting

58:01.000 --> 58:11.040
to see those artists be sort of acquired and be highlighted and be displayed.

58:11.040 --> 58:18.480
But it's now beginning to happen over the course of the last couple of decades or something

58:18.480 --> 58:19.720
like that.

58:19.720 --> 58:24.760
And it will probably just continue to grow and there will be more and more interest in

58:24.760 --> 58:27.160
maybe in 20 years.

58:27.160 --> 58:32.920
It will be very common that a museum is going to be filled with digital art, which even

58:32.920 --> 58:36.080
now it's still not exactly common.

58:36.080 --> 58:43.480
You go to most of the world class museums or galleries and they're still not primarily

58:43.480 --> 58:49.480
digital art, even though, you know, I think in as time goes on, we're living these sort

58:49.480 --> 58:58.240
of very digital lives and we do have a lot of digital outputs and sometimes the ratio

58:58.240 --> 59:04.320
of things don't really in current galleries don't really reflect the reality.

59:04.320 --> 59:07.360
So that's one thing is just that it's going to continue to expand and grow and there'll

59:07.360 --> 59:11.280
be different takes on a different ways of exploring that.

59:11.280 --> 59:19.120
But then also I think with NFTs specifically, I think it will continue to like shift very,

59:19.120 --> 59:20.120
very drastically.

59:20.120 --> 59:24.960
I think the NFTs that we're seeing right now are like one type.

59:24.960 --> 59:28.760
So like the reffic anodele in MoMA.

59:28.760 --> 59:35.160
I think we will probably also continue to see museums and galleries, I mean, not that they

59:35.160 --> 59:42.200
haven't already, but they will continue to have this focus on using the blockchain and

59:42.200 --> 59:48.240
using these systems as like artistic mediums.

59:48.240 --> 59:56.160
So I mean, the work of Ray and Myers or Deathbeef, I think those kind of artists will, you know,

59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.960
be highlighted more and there will be more and more interest in building systems that

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:11.200
are using these kind of tools and using these kind of technologies.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.400
Whereas sometimes there's a lot, there has been a lot of like mainstream focus and I

01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.280
would count MoMA sort of as this mainstream sort of focus as well as like the NFT as an

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:28.800
image for the NFT as like a, as a gift for NFT animation or something.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.800
But I don't think that's really the realistic future of NFTs.

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:35.520
I think they will be expanded to much more.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.560
And I think it'll be pretty common that a lot of artists that work with digital and even

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:45.400
a lot of artists that work with physical will be distributing their work through these mechanisms,

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.160
even if they don't, you know, explicitly call them NFTs.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:54.680
So just say I'm releasing some work and it's an auction, like right now I couldn't imagine

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:57.520
setting up my own auction with fiat.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:02.000
I think it would be a disastrous nightmare where I was setting up an auction with crypto

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.120
is actually kind of makes sense.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.920
Like you can have a Dutch auction with crypto and thousands of millions of people can participate

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:14.080
in it and you don't need to go to a single place like Christie's.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:18.840
You can, you know, build these systems without going to Christie's or without going to Saudi

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.840
ways.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:22.720
And you can direct how much percentage you want from the auction.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.440
You don't need to subscribe to a 50% cut or something like that.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:32.960
So I think it will just continue to grow and expand basically.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:44.200
Helena, it's largest asked for your future prediction.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.160
I think you're like in sync with Matt with what Matt said.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.480
And honestly, I don't care much about being in museum or not being in museum.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:59.520
I mean, I enjoy like the NFT gave artists the freedom to sell their stuff, to be shown

01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.880
without kind of like institutions.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:06.800
I haven't been to sort of this or anything, but kind of like, I don't feel miserable

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800
because of this.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:13.360
I mean, I kind of like create my own story.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.600
So that's NFT again.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.480
It's like about freedom and that's what I kind of like about it.

01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:23.960
And I hope it continues like this.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:33.040
I mean, we have enough kind of like tooling and infrastructure to make it happen with

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.680
independent collectors, with independent artists.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:38.120
And that's the beauty of it.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:42.840
I don't want to be in centralized honestly.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:03:00.320
You know, from my perspective, I think it's an honor to be recognized by entities that

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:08.360
have been around for a long, long time and have managed to stay relevant.

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:22.360
We lost I excels again.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:28.360
You're back.

01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.360
Beautiful.

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:36.920
So before I'm misunderstood, what I'm trying to say is that NFT is definitely or like blockchain

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:39.600
art is a revolution.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.840
It's a way for us to create our own museums.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:51.520
Like we are actually moving up to long ago about how it was called like, but also Tranquilidad

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:58.040
Agasso program sale, which means for your tranquility, do your own museum.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:05.920
For some people, being a museum is not about just the recognition that it's about preserving.

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:11.760
I will literally just disappear if my art disappears.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.360
I don't think I could stand that.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:27.200
And if we keep it in an unstable place, like it's a web browser or Instagram, like it certainly

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.920
carries that risk.

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:36.960
I think one of my biggest goals is to preserve myself through time regardless if I'm here

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.040
or not.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:48.560
So that's one of the reasons why I enjoy or I respect the fact that museums are paying

01:04:48.560 --> 01:05:02.360
attention to this.

01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:05.360
We lost her again.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.880
That's what a few seconds and then, no, she's back.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.880
She's always coming back.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:11.480
That's the good thing we know by now.

01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:14.480
It's very reliable.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:20.760
I shall be coming back.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.480
Or maybe not this time around.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:27.200
I mean, the good thing is you all know where to find us on Twitter and on Discord.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:33.120
So if you have further questions, please just send them to us via Twitter.

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.440

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.240
art and thank you for the audience and for your great questions.

Bye.

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720
Bye.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.720
Bye.

Bye.
