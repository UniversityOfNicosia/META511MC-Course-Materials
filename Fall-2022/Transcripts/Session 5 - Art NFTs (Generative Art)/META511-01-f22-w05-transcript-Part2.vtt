00:00.000 --> 00:22.120
Okay.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.080
Well, welcome, everyone.

00:24.080 --> 00:32.600
We are super excited today to have Snowfro Eric, the founder of Art Blocks with us.

00:32.600 --> 00:40.040
Art Blocks, I think most people know this but for those who don't, is by far the dominant

00:40.040 --> 00:44.720
platform or enabling technology for generative art.

00:44.720 --> 00:53.480
So far a very large percentage of important generative art projects were launched in

00:53.480 --> 00:58.040
Art Blocks and a large amount of the market activity is on Art Blocks.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.200
And so I'm very honored and excited that he's joining us today.

01:03.200 --> 01:10.080
We're going to cover his background, how he got here in the first place.

01:10.080 --> 01:15.360
Where the future of Art Blocks and generative art is going and then maybe touch upon some

01:15.360 --> 01:18.760
broader industry topics and what they might mean.

01:18.760 --> 01:23.640
So Eric first, thank you very much and thank you, welcome to the course.

01:23.640 --> 01:24.640
Thanks for having me.

01:24.640 --> 01:25.640
This is a little special.

01:25.640 --> 01:27.000
This is my first metaverse course.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.160
So pretty excited to be here.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.000
Let's start with the easy question.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.400
How did you end up in the NFT field?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.120
How did you end up founding Art Blocks?

01:39.120 --> 01:41.680
Why did you find out what?

01:41.680 --> 01:44.680
What's the point and purpose submission of Art Blocks?

01:44.680 --> 01:49.280
Well, let's start with NFT.

01:49.280 --> 01:55.560
So in 2017, I got really excited about Ethereum early, like January 2017, early in the year

01:55.560 --> 02:00.880
and started tinkering with smart contracts and really just like, you know, I was excited

02:00.880 --> 02:03.200
about Bitcoin and blockchain technology.

02:03.200 --> 02:06.440
But when I discovered the concept of a smart contract, it really clicked.

02:06.440 --> 02:12.000
And it felt like honestly, I feel like the smart contract is the killer app of blockchain

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
technology.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.880
It's just so technical that it may not be what the mainstream sees that as.

02:17.880 --> 02:25.400
But I tinkered, wrote some smart contracts, tried to, like everybody else figure out how

02:25.400 --> 02:29.280
to integrate the technology into their regular life.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.920
I was in charge of a ceramic tile importing business.

02:32.920 --> 02:38.600
So couldn't be less technical, but always looking for like, exploring for ways of like,

02:38.600 --> 02:44.160
you know, finding the technology living in the real world.

02:44.160 --> 02:50.160
During that time, I saw a lot of organizations release projects in the NFT space, I mean,

02:50.160 --> 02:51.960
sorry, in the crypto space.

02:51.960 --> 02:57.520
I oftentimes found them to be a square peg around hole, just, you know, have meetings

02:57.520 --> 02:59.800
with people and it was just like, blockchain, blockchain, blockchain.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.960
And like, how am I going to use this?

03:00.960 --> 03:01.960
What am I going to do with it?

03:01.960 --> 03:06.720
And I was actually really kind of put off by just like the rush towards utilizing the

03:06.720 --> 03:11.680
technology without thinking about how actual use case would be with the product market.

03:11.680 --> 03:15.920
It would be the distribution mechanisms, et cetera.

03:15.920 --> 03:24.440
Fast forward to June 2017, I was on Reddit and I saw a link for the CryptoPunks project.

03:24.440 --> 03:29.160
Clicked it, read it, read all the information that was created and put together by larval

03:29.160 --> 03:36.200
labs and just like old moment for me, it was like, yeah, this is, this is, this is awesome.

03:36.200 --> 03:41.080
First of all, it was a generative art project, a 10,000 character generative art project,

03:41.080 --> 03:44.440
which, you know, I've always been really big in the generative art.

03:44.440 --> 03:51.560
And a project that to me was demonstrating in a very simple decentralized manner, the

03:51.560 --> 03:59.360
beauty of the technology, the simplicity and the power of being able to prove ownership

03:59.360 --> 04:02.560
of a digital asset.

04:02.560 --> 04:08.680
So I claimed a bunch of CryptoPunks, a lot of them were zombies, 34 to be exact.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.840
And I then dove right in and never looked back.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.920
It was very slow at the beginning in terms of people in the space, spent the next few

04:19.920 --> 04:26.120
years onboarding anybody that was interested in hearing about the technology, both IRL

04:26.120 --> 04:31.360
and in the CryptoPunks Discord, which was oftentimes a very slow place and oftentimes

04:31.360 --> 04:33.880
a pretty exciting place.

04:33.880 --> 04:39.560
All the while continuing a practice of creating art with code, something that I had started

04:39.560 --> 04:44.960
about six, seven years prior to that, tinkering with projection mapping and generating visual

04:44.960 --> 04:49.640
outputs with, with code.

04:49.640 --> 05:02.080
And finally, in 2020, after Art Blocks version one, two and three, just kind of feeling like

05:02.080 --> 05:07.260
I had an idea that wasn't able to really kind of put into action, I launched Art Blocks

05:07.260 --> 05:12.120
formally is what you see it today, which is the fourth iteration of Art Blocks conceptually

05:12.120 --> 05:18.000
as a platform intending to host, hopefully, the best generative art from the best generative

05:18.000 --> 05:24.480
artists in the world, using a technology that in my opinion demonstrates the power of watching

05:24.480 --> 05:30.840
an FT, which is a distribution mechanism for individualized outputs, the one of one of

05:30.840 --> 05:37.600
acts concept in a way that really would have been very difficult time consuming in the past

05:37.600 --> 05:38.600
for an artist.

05:38.600 --> 05:46.920
And to kind of put it all in a box, a generative artist prior to Art Blocks would have created

05:46.920 --> 05:55.040
an algorithm, produced visual outputs from that algorithm, save them on their hard drive

05:55.040 --> 05:59.120
and pre-block changes just displayed them, post them on Instagram, and maybe work with the

05:59.120 --> 06:05.400
gallery printed them, had exhibitions, et cetera.

06:05.400 --> 06:13.960
Post NFTs would save them on their hard drive, tokenize them, and then list them on a marketplace.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.520
And what Art Blocks did is actually cut those three steps out of the middle and make it

06:18.520 --> 06:22.800
to where the algorithmic artist would just upload the algorithm to the blockchain.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.600
And when the collector came to make a purchase, they would be purchasing a new iteration,

06:27.600 --> 06:29.960
a new output of that algorithm.

06:29.960 --> 06:34.280
And it would happen on demand, on the fly, the artist actually doesn't know exactly what's

06:34.280 --> 06:38.880
going to come out of the mentor, but has highly curated their algorithm in advance.

06:38.880 --> 06:46.400
And the collector, it becomes the creator, the one that actually makes the artwork happen.

06:46.400 --> 06:52.120
And the artwork is immediately and automatically deposited into their wallet.

06:52.120 --> 06:57.760
The product market fit is not what I expected.

06:57.760 --> 07:03.880
This is a hobby, and this was a hobby, and just literally like a hugely nerdy hobby that

07:03.880 --> 07:07.840
I thought had a tiny little niche audience.

07:07.840 --> 07:16.160
But the product market fit has demonstrated a desire, I think, for humans to be individuals

07:16.160 --> 07:22.160
and to display and collect things that are unique to them, and the technology enables

07:22.160 --> 07:25.840
that to happen in a way that could happen before.

07:25.840 --> 07:33.200
Can you spend a couple of minutes on exactly how the process works?

07:33.200 --> 07:40.000
Because I think some people might not understand what it means, and if T is on chain, that

07:40.000 --> 07:46.520
the algorithm is on chain, it is created at the time of the minting.

07:46.520 --> 07:52.160
And I say this, not even new people to the space actually, even people who are not new

07:52.160 --> 07:54.800
to the space, often don't understand exactly how it works.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.880
You may have spent two minutes on that.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.880
Yeah.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.880
I was recently on a panel with a very smart man that was talking about this concept of

08:02.880 --> 08:04.600
the stores of value.

08:04.600 --> 08:08.760
And there's a lot of things in the NFT space that can act as a store of value, but one

08:08.760 --> 08:13.440
thing that makes things a store of value is this sovereign bearer asset concept, right?

08:13.440 --> 08:22.040
Where there are no external influences in your ability to, A, prove ownership, and B, experience

08:22.040 --> 08:24.280
the artwork in the future.

08:24.280 --> 08:30.080
And so one of the things that are really interesting about our box is that we are very strict with

08:30.080 --> 08:34.680
artists and require them to upload algorithmic art.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.840
This is computer-generated art.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.400
They upload the code that generates the art.

08:39.400 --> 08:45.080
So blockchain storage is very expensive, prohibitively expensive.

08:45.080 --> 08:54.560
It's impossible to store an image on the blockchain without spending a lot of money on gas.

08:54.560 --> 09:07.560
And the idea here that the artwork stored on chain could generate a one megabyte image

09:07.560 --> 09:12.560
or a 1000 megabyte image, depending on the resolution at which the image was displayed

09:12.560 --> 09:13.920
was really intriguing to me.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.320
Like, if the limitation of the blockchain is storage, meaning that we can't really store

09:18.320 --> 09:23.480
high-resolution files on it, but if we want art to persist because it's stored on blockchain

09:23.480 --> 09:30.080
technology, to me the solution was storing the root of it, the algorithm of it on the

09:30.080 --> 09:31.080
blockchain.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.240
And that algorithm, something that we're very strict with artists to make it what we call

09:34.240 --> 09:38.640
resolution agnostic, meaning that it can be displayed and will display identically at

09:38.640 --> 09:48.320
any resolution that computer are capable of displaying, felt incredibly compelling as

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
a way of utilizing the medium.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.120
And so, you know, people have recently referred to this as like the most true form of internet

09:56.120 --> 10:02.960
art or utilizing internet technology or digital technology to create art simply because it

10:02.960 --> 10:05.320
is meant to stand a test of time.

10:05.320 --> 10:11.520
And it stands a test of time from a resolution perspective, which we kind of didn't expect

10:11.520 --> 10:16.160
to need until later, maybe four or five years down the road, I figure maybe that they would

10:16.160 --> 10:20.680
release some new resolution television that would really demonstrate the power of the

10:20.680 --> 10:23.080
resolution agnosticism of an artworks artwork.

10:23.080 --> 10:28.520
Yet, this year, during a conference, there was an installation that we got to display

10:28.520 --> 10:33.800
artworks, artworks on a three-story screen at the Samsung headquarters in New York.

10:33.800 --> 10:39.200
And we were able to generate the artwork for a three-story screen at the full resolution

10:39.200 --> 10:41.240
that that screen could provide.

10:41.240 --> 10:49.320
And no matter what you do with any artwork that's stored as a JPEG or a GIF, you cannot.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.840
You either have to upsample, digitally up-sample that artwork, or you have to display

10:52.840 --> 10:56.800
it at a smaller size than what the screen is capable of doing.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.840
And there's something very powerful about something where all of the information required

11:01.840 --> 11:04.480
to recreate that algorithm is stored on chain.

11:04.480 --> 11:10.680
We used to say most of the information, but now we're seeing other community members upload,

11:10.680 --> 11:15.840
even the libraries like P5JS and 3JS that we use to generate these outputs are now also

11:15.840 --> 11:16.840
being stored on chain.

11:16.840 --> 11:22.320
So all of the information necessary to restore this artwork is stored on chain and it's able

11:22.320 --> 11:24.560
to be produced at any resolution.

11:24.560 --> 11:29.800
And it's a sovereign bare asset where nobody is deciding or making decisions as to how

11:29.800 --> 11:32.360
you utilize the NFT.

11:32.360 --> 11:37.760
As long as you own that digital asset, as long as you own that NFT, you own the rights

11:37.760 --> 11:41.120
that are conveyed by the artist, depending on the license that they provided, generally

11:41.120 --> 11:45.800
it's either a Creative Commons for license, the NFT license, or even a Creative Commons

11:45.800 --> 11:49.200
zero license, the CC0 license.

11:49.200 --> 11:58.560
And then you are at your leisure to how you utilize that, how you control, how you store

11:58.560 --> 12:04.120
that digital asset, knowing that that digital asset will persist as long as the blockchain

12:04.120 --> 12:05.120
persists.

12:05.120 --> 12:08.760
And that's what the future looks like, but given the transparency and the beauty of blockchain

12:08.760 --> 12:12.920
technology, I think that blockchain technology will last for a long time.

12:12.920 --> 12:17.840
And we're really excited about what that looks like, where these assets that were created

12:17.840 --> 12:24.480
in 2020, 2021, 2022, maybe in the year 2075 are still being able to be reproduced at full

12:24.480 --> 12:26.400
scale, full resolution.

12:26.400 --> 12:33.520
And you are still the owner of that asset in a way that's provable.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.560
It's revolutionary to be able to prove ownership of something digital, and then to then take

12:38.560 --> 12:45.080
it further and be able to reproduce that digital thing at any resolution, or within any environment

12:45.080 --> 12:49.600
is something that I think is truly special.

12:49.600 --> 12:56.720
And has a lot to do with why there's so much value placed on these artworks.

12:56.720 --> 13:05.240
And the point is that when someone mints at the time that they're minting, there is

13:05.240 --> 13:09.640
a random aspect that has to do with the time that they press the button, right?

13:09.640 --> 13:15.800
And this is how somehow there are a lot of you that are in a way a co-creator, in a limited

13:15.800 --> 13:23.600
sense perhaps, but the moment that they chose to click, determine what the work looked like,

13:23.600 --> 13:24.600
right?

13:24.600 --> 13:29.480
And then there is this concept of entropy, which is a concept of the amount of randomness,

13:29.480 --> 13:31.720
or where the source of randomness comes from.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.240
And on the blockchain, there's no pure randomness.

13:34.240 --> 13:37.680
It's pseudo-randomness, which means that there's always a deterministic nature of watching

13:37.680 --> 13:38.920
technology.

13:38.920 --> 13:45.640
But we utilize a bunch of fun little tips and tricks to make it more complex, borderline,

13:45.640 --> 13:52.280
or I would, you should never say impossible, but very, very difficult for someone to game

13:52.280 --> 13:55.080
the determinism of an art block piece.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.400
And what's beautiful about it is, you know, sometimes say, oh, if I would have minted

13:58.400 --> 14:03.480
number 25, I would have gotten something nicer or something different.

14:03.480 --> 14:12.120
The reality is that every little component from the balance of the USDC smart contract

14:12.120 --> 14:19.200
to the block ID and transaction hash changes and shapes the entropy of what went into the

14:19.200 --> 14:26.560
piece, and so every mint is truly uncontrolled by the user, or mostly uncontrolled by the

14:26.560 --> 14:29.480
user and random.

14:29.480 --> 14:36.560
And that forces the artists to really craft and curate an algorithm where they are putting

14:36.560 --> 14:40.680
their stamp of approval on every single output that's going to come out of that, because

14:40.680 --> 14:42.000
they need neither.

14:42.000 --> 14:46.560
They know the collector has control over what they're actually going to get in the end.

14:46.560 --> 14:54.120
Right, so what you're saying is, if I minted number 26, and I said, oh, man, 25 is beautiful,

14:54.120 --> 14:55.600
I wish I had just clicked earlier.

14:55.600 --> 15:00.640
If I had clicked earlier, the likelihood that I would have gotten 25 is infinitesimally

15:00.640 --> 15:06.320
small because unless it was the exact same millisecond or milliseconds that the previous

15:06.320 --> 15:09.840
person would click 25, 25 would have been different.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.080
Even that, but even the fact that your wallet address is different.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.960
So all of these things come into play into the entropy, and our blocks has evolved significantly

15:17.960 --> 15:21.760
the pseudo random number generator or the pseudo random generator that we're using.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.440
So even with the new smart contracts, it's even different from that.

15:24.440 --> 15:30.080
But ideally, there was enough entropy in there to where, you know, and this could be a tangent,

15:30.080 --> 15:34.160
so maybe we don't go to you window, but oftentimes people are like, oh, I want my birthday, or

15:34.160 --> 15:37.720
I want my DNA to be inside of an artwork.

15:37.720 --> 15:43.160
My response is that, you know, if my DNA generates something green and your DNA generates something

15:43.160 --> 15:48.760
yellow, and I know that my DNA generated that green one because it's my DNA, sure.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.320
But if my DNA generated something and yours generated something different, and we couldn't

15:52.320 --> 15:56.680
tell the difference between who generated who's, then really, it doesn't really matter what

15:56.680 --> 16:00.320
the source of entropy is as long as it's pseudo random or random.

16:00.320 --> 16:09.640
And it doesn't, I don't know that people actually want to have too much of a say in what the

16:09.640 --> 16:10.640
output is.

16:10.640 --> 16:17.720
I think, at least for me, I like being able to control fully, well, limitedly because

16:17.720 --> 16:22.840
it's pseudo random, but be able to craft what the algorithm produces.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.940
And oftentimes, you know, we see people kind of go down this path, especially with our

16:25.940 --> 16:30.520
boxes, we kind of expand people are like, hey, can I put my birthday or my wallet address

16:30.520 --> 16:34.960
or my DNA, make that be the source of random for the piece.

16:34.960 --> 16:40.480
And I think it's actually fun and intriguing, but the result would be not palpable.

16:40.480 --> 16:47.200
And if the results not palpable, then it's an unnecessary intrusion into the block, the

16:47.200 --> 16:49.240
air gapped nature of the blockchain.

16:49.240 --> 16:53.000
And that's something that kind of goes back to like the art is on chain.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.160
And then also the generation of the seed is on chain, and therefore everything is air

16:58.160 --> 17:05.600
gapped and free from human meddling, for the most part, using this technology and the

17:05.600 --> 17:06.600
provenance there.

17:06.600 --> 17:10.760
I mean, obviously the NFT technology provides some crazy provenance in terms of ownership

17:10.760 --> 17:17.560
history and, you know, some financial information, but this added provenance of everything generated,

17:17.560 --> 17:24.840
stored on chain in an air gapped fashion, I think further enhances the durability of

17:24.840 --> 17:32.160
these things that people are looking at as not just like beautiful art and cultural items

17:32.160 --> 17:36.120
now, but also stores a value for the future.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.720
Makes perfect sense.

17:38.720 --> 17:46.360
Any touch upon something else you said, a common way people describe these types of

17:46.360 --> 17:52.440
collections is one of one of X that each one's unique, but they're part of a broader whole

17:52.440 --> 17:56.760
Tyler Hobbes calls them long form generative collections.

17:56.760 --> 18:05.840
And I think there's at least one point of view that this really is the natural medium

18:05.840 --> 18:07.480
for generative art.

18:07.480 --> 18:15.400
It's found its home because you can let everyone can see the algorithm operating at the same

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
time.

18:16.400 --> 18:18.400
What's your view on this?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.360
Yeah, this goes in so many levels.

18:20.360 --> 18:24.920
I mean, if you just take a step back to one of one, right?

18:24.920 --> 18:26.640
I'm sorry, one of X.

18:26.640 --> 18:33.760
So in the physical world, you trust a photographer to do an addition of 10, but you don't know

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
how many.

18:34.760 --> 18:39.760
I mean, we need to make sure that we can trust artists just institutionally, like down to

18:39.760 --> 18:45.920
the roots, we need to be in a position to trust artists.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.920
I live here in Houston and I love that the contemporary art museum here in Houston has

18:49.920 --> 18:53.080
this slogan that says, trust artist period, right?

18:53.080 --> 18:57.240
So we need to trust artists, but there's something really beautiful about NFT technology where

18:57.240 --> 19:01.840
if it's a one of X, if it's a one of 10, it's demonstrable.

19:01.840 --> 19:08.000
The artist is publicly accepting a capped limitation for that addition.

19:08.000 --> 19:12.760
Sure, they could go mint the same art on another platform, but it would be traceable

19:12.760 --> 19:15.440
and you would still be able to get back to what the original was.

19:15.440 --> 19:19.720
Sure, they can go print an addition of 10 and sign 10 additions and call those one of

19:19.720 --> 19:21.800
10, two of 10, three of 10.

19:21.800 --> 19:28.400
But ultimately, if we trust the artist to like act in their best interest and within

19:28.400 --> 19:35.000
the cultural norm that the art profession kind of provides, there's an opportunity for

19:35.000 --> 19:37.640
the artists to demonstrably choose an addition size.

19:37.640 --> 19:47.600
Now, an addition size of 100 of the same output is perfectly suitable for photography, 3D

19:47.600 --> 19:52.480
art, stuff made on procreate, I mean, things that are made with the hand.

19:52.480 --> 19:59.800
But in an increasingly digital world, we are drawn to a digital representation that distinguishes

19:59.800 --> 20:01.520
us from other people.

20:01.520 --> 20:05.920
And so while there's nothing technically wrong with making a PFP or an avatar out of

20:05.920 --> 20:10.080
an addition of 100 where it's like everybody can potentially have that, 100 people can

20:10.080 --> 20:11.800
have that same avatar.

20:11.800 --> 20:18.280
The internet has trained us to try to be as individualistic as we are in real life.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.440
And it's impossible.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.840
It's physically impossible.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.840
I could be called out for saying things that are impossible.

20:23.840 --> 20:27.680
So maybe it's very, very, very improbable that there would be two humans with the same

20:27.680 --> 20:33.960
air count and facial structure, I mean, literally identical humans.

20:33.960 --> 20:38.240
And I think that kind of translates well into the digital space.

20:38.240 --> 20:46.040
The concept of one of one of X is that the larval labs guys could not have, I mean, technically

20:46.040 --> 20:51.520
you could have created 10,000 crypto punks individually by placing pixels.

20:51.520 --> 20:55.440
Like that would not have been a good use of time, especially knowing the power of what

20:55.440 --> 20:57.200
the technology can provide.

20:57.200 --> 21:01.200
But what they did is they wrote an algorithm that created 10,000 pixels and 10,000, I mean,

21:01.200 --> 21:05.480
10 characters with 24 inch by 24 pixel by 24 pixel characters.

21:05.480 --> 21:10.040
And when they first came out, it felt like it was too many, especially in the typical

21:10.040 --> 21:19.280
norm of art, like 10,000 works of art in one fell swoop is a lot.

21:19.280 --> 21:20.360
It felt like a lot.

21:20.360 --> 21:24.800
There was really a few hundred people maybe participating actively in the space in the

21:24.800 --> 21:28.680
first couple of years after the release of the CryptoPugs project.

21:28.680 --> 21:34.520
But what we've learned is that as, forget about the speculation, the FOMO and all the

21:34.520 --> 21:41.880
money involved, like as this technology finds a foothold in our daily lives of transparency.

21:41.880 --> 21:45.480
And you know, my daily life is very different than the majority of humans because I use

21:45.480 --> 21:48.840
Metamask on a daily basis to authenticate who I am.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.280
So I understand we're not there yet in the mainstream.

21:51.280 --> 21:56.680
But as this technology has kind of taken a foothold, we realize that 10,000 is nothing.

21:56.680 --> 21:59.160
10,000 is very, very, very few.

21:59.160 --> 22:04.040
And that's demonstrated by the value, the kind of insane value that CryptoPunks and

22:04.040 --> 22:07.000
Board Apes have.

22:07.000 --> 22:11.440
And that value is what we are assigning as humans to being individuals.

22:11.440 --> 22:16.840
Because I don't believe that the value of 10,000 CryptoPunks would be what it is today

22:16.840 --> 22:22.920
if it was 10,000 of the same CryptoPunk as in addition of 10,000 or even the same 100

22:22.920 --> 22:27.720
editions of 100, the value would not be what it is today.

22:27.720 --> 22:31.360
The value is what it is today because of a sense of individuality.

22:31.360 --> 22:36.600
If I'm flicking through Twitter, I see your avatar, your PFP way before I see your name

22:36.600 --> 22:39.840
and I know who you are.

22:39.840 --> 22:43.720
Unless it's like a funk or, oh, actually that's facing the other direction or maybe like a

22:43.720 --> 22:45.560
B1 punk, but that has a different background.

22:45.560 --> 22:49.760
Like, there's something really special in the digital world about the individuality.

22:49.760 --> 22:53.480
And this goes back to this product, market fit, and I'm not trying to make art sound

22:53.480 --> 22:56.640
like a product and collect or sound like a market.

22:56.640 --> 23:02.240
But the distribution mechanism for an artist to create something with a demonstrable addition

23:02.240 --> 23:09.880
size in a large addition without intermediary steps and all the information used to recreate

23:09.880 --> 23:10.960
that artwork is on chain.

23:10.960 --> 23:14.560
It's just unprecedented stuff to be able to put it together like that.

23:14.560 --> 23:19.400
And I definitely want to reiterate that that is not when I launched ArtBlox, like I was

23:19.400 --> 23:21.360
excited about the one of one of X concept.

23:21.360 --> 23:27.760
I was excited about art being on chain, but I did not fully understand the product market

23:27.760 --> 23:32.920
fit, the distribution mechanism and the value proposition that this would have beyond the

23:32.920 --> 23:37.120
small niche generative art world.

23:37.120 --> 23:43.200
I literally saw this as a cool tool for generative artists, did not fully embrace or understand

23:43.200 --> 23:47.520
this product market fit until a couple of months into it when I started to realize just

23:47.520 --> 23:54.840
like how powerful the sense of community was around being a the creator of an artwork

23:54.840 --> 24:00.880
alongside the artist, the one that created the piece and then the sharing of it within

24:00.880 --> 24:03.880
a community of people with the artist president.

24:03.880 --> 24:10.800
Yeah, I still to this day kind of like and shocked at how it exploded, but also totally

24:10.800 --> 24:14.680
understand from a human perspective why it is exploded.

24:14.680 --> 24:19.200
And so one of one of X continues to be something that we pursue.

24:19.200 --> 24:23.840
I often say that the lowest friction use case of one of one of X is pixels on a screen

24:23.840 --> 24:30.280
with demonstrated a wonderful kind of community reception to the pixels on a screen being

24:30.280 --> 24:33.520
artwork that just lives in the digital space.

24:33.520 --> 24:36.440
And now we're really excited and earlier you asked, you know, what does the feature

24:36.440 --> 24:37.920
of ArtBlox look like?

24:37.920 --> 24:41.160
I don't think this ends at pixels on a screen.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.600
I do think that this permeates into the real world.

24:45.600 --> 24:52.600
And while I'm not fully in tune or understand like what the implications are of physical

24:52.600 --> 24:57.840
and digital goods that are meaningfully connected, it makes me.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.240
It just feels like an unresolved thing in my gut.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.600
The idea of like an ephemeral physical object that's derived from a digital object that

25:05.600 --> 25:10.520
you are the sole and provable owner of is something that I find fascinating and something that

25:10.520 --> 25:14.160
I really look forward to exploring beyond the pixels on a screen concept.

25:14.160 --> 25:19.240
And I really think that's where ArtBlox is going to be hopefully, you know, shepherding

25:19.240 --> 25:30.080
the world into enabling their audiences to own both digital and physical one of one of

25:30.080 --> 25:37.320
X's as opposed to like one copies of the same exact object when applicable.

25:37.320 --> 25:42.240
Obviously like we may not need spatulas that are one of one of X's.

25:42.240 --> 25:46.840
But yeah, in a future where I can mint a car and the car is unique to me for whatever reason.

25:46.840 --> 25:48.360
Yeah, I would look forward to that.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.280
And maybe that's 50 years down the road.

25:50.280 --> 25:53.960
I don't know, but I'd be excited about it.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.640
You had mentioned something at the beginning.

25:55.640 --> 26:00.200
It's very minor, but I want to flag it because it's the same way I think about the space.

26:00.200 --> 26:01.920
You had said the puncture generative.

26:01.920 --> 26:07.560
In my view is that most PFP collections, the way they're done, are also generative.

26:07.560 --> 26:13.640
And so if you think about the PFP's end-generative art, it means the vast majority of NFT spaces

26:13.640 --> 26:16.360
as it is today is in fact generative.

26:16.360 --> 26:17.360
Is that right?

26:17.360 --> 26:18.360
Yes, absolutely.

26:18.360 --> 26:26.680
Yeah, it's all, I mean, unless someone's drawing each individual one, yeah, it's by definition

26:26.680 --> 26:27.680
generative.

26:27.680 --> 26:37.680
I think it's further confirmation that generative might have found its native medium with NFTs.

26:37.680 --> 26:45.640
I think that there's a chance that if crypto punks were not generative, I may not have

26:45.640 --> 26:52.800
claimed them because it was a pain in the ass back then to claim an NFT.

26:52.800 --> 26:58.240
There was no metamasker, I didn't know about it, and I'd sink my Ethereum wallet, etc.

26:58.240 --> 27:03.920
And what caught my eye was the fact that it was generative and the fact that something

27:03.920 --> 27:07.640
generative was made accessible in this way.

27:07.640 --> 27:17.080
And people always say like larva labs is essentially instituted a 10k number for a PFP.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.080
It felt like a lot.

27:18.080 --> 27:25.360
A lot that came after that came from that concept of a generative thing, crypto kitties,

27:25.360 --> 27:26.880
also generative.

27:26.880 --> 27:33.280
And then everything that came after that, that was minted on demand was in fact generative,

27:33.280 --> 27:37.680
whether there was a reveal process afterwards or not, it was still a generative piece.

27:37.680 --> 27:42.080
Okay, this is an amazing background.

27:42.080 --> 27:44.880
Let's talk about the next steps in art blocks.

27:44.880 --> 27:50.920
And let's start again with some basics, art blocks used to have three collection types,

27:50.920 --> 27:53.840
curated, playground and factory.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.680
Now there's a different set, there's collaborations, there's also an API.

27:58.680 --> 27:59.680
How was it before?

27:59.680 --> 28:00.680
How was it now?

28:00.680 --> 28:03.760
What are the differences in the types of collections?

28:03.760 --> 28:05.280
Why did you make the change?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.920
Why did the series end?

28:06.920 --> 28:10.000
And so I'd love to hear about that.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.240
Well, first of all, I made collections initially when it was just me.

28:14.240 --> 28:19.880
And then Jeff Davis was working alongside me actually contract basis initially just because

28:19.880 --> 28:25.240
he was such a wonderful person to work with and like so involved early on.

28:25.240 --> 28:31.120
But when I was still kind of making all the decisions for the most part, I started getting

28:31.120 --> 28:36.240
the sense of dread of being the naysayer.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.480
And I am generally someone that is a very inclusive person.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.840
I don't like to leave people out.

28:40.840 --> 28:47.080
I don't like to say no to people generally, although I've had to say that more and more

28:47.080 --> 28:48.080
in.

28:48.080 --> 28:54.960
But then at the same time, before art blocks launched, I got very little traction.

28:54.960 --> 28:59.240
Some of the best artists in the world that I've since launched on art blocks, like fully

28:59.240 --> 29:05.400
ignored tweet messages and direct messages, Reddit messages when I reached out in 2018,

29:05.400 --> 29:07.960
2019, 2020 to talk about art blocks.

29:07.960 --> 29:11.680
And I totally understand why it was a shit show of information that I would just like

29:11.680 --> 29:14.200
regurgitate to them and be like, yeah, this is crazy.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.240
Or they just went on fire.

29:18.240 --> 29:23.760
In the first few weeks of art blocks, everything except for the Chromium School sold out immediately.

29:23.760 --> 29:29.640
And I think it peaked a lot of artists' interest and oftentimes with things that make people

29:29.640 --> 29:34.520
money, there are people that make things because they're artists and they love it and they're

29:34.520 --> 29:36.400
excited about sharing.

29:36.400 --> 29:41.240
And then there's people that make things because they can and because they can make money.

29:41.240 --> 29:47.760
And I did not feel that I was the right person to mean making those decisions.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.760
I didn't have time.

29:48.760 --> 29:50.440
First of all, I was not sleeping.

29:50.440 --> 29:56.960
And so I was making those decisions on behalf of the platform for artists that I don't know

29:56.960 --> 29:59.320
and I didn't know and I didn't have time to research.

29:59.320 --> 30:05.440
And so the first thing I did was create this territorial board to potentially say no to

30:05.440 --> 30:06.360
art.

30:06.360 --> 30:10.720
Very little art initially was said no to.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.720
And I still wanted art blocks to be a fully open platform.

30:14.720 --> 30:17.040
So I still wanted a place for people to release art.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.960
I just wanted to celebrate the best art.

30:21.960 --> 30:27.440
And so I added a couple categories.

30:27.440 --> 30:31.440
First of all, playground because we had some very prolific artists that were wanting to

30:31.440 --> 30:33.560
release more work that had already released on art blocks.

30:33.560 --> 30:37.400
And I didn't want to call it curated because I wanted there to be like a little pause just

30:37.400 --> 30:38.920
to give some breathing room.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.320
And then what we called the factory which was originally intended to be the open platform

30:42.320 --> 30:46.840
for anybody that can code a pixel onto a screen to code a pixel onto a screen.

30:46.840 --> 30:55.520
And that also served as a fall back for as we were getting more and more artists.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.080
I mean within a couple of weeks of opening an artist application, we had 300 artists apply.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.240
It was just like an impossibility to keep up with stuff.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.600
It gave us a bucket to put art that we were excited or wanted to give people a shot at

31:06.600 --> 31:10.680
like producing art in this way but did not want it to be feet.

31:10.680 --> 31:15.560
Like it wasn't at the level of the art that was coming that was to be featured in the

31:15.560 --> 31:16.560
curated section.

31:16.560 --> 31:24.080
So then after a year and a half, there was a shift in curation where we added a second

31:24.080 --> 31:27.360
curation process which is a screening process internally.

31:27.360 --> 31:32.560
And from feedback from some of the some of the really strong artists on the Art Block

31:32.560 --> 31:37.600
website and this idea that we wanted to make sure that all of the artwork on our box, not

31:37.600 --> 31:45.240
just curated, perpetuated the value of effort that artists put into their work.

31:45.240 --> 31:52.640
We started screening a significant percentage of artworks and lost the ability to kind of

31:52.640 --> 31:54.480
host everybody's art on our blocks.

31:54.480 --> 31:59.440
And it was really kind of sad for me because I really was really excited about the open

31:59.440 --> 32:02.160
democratized nature of the platform.

32:02.160 --> 32:06.720
But also when I launched Art Box, I didn't realize that we would have such incredibly

32:06.720 --> 32:09.960
powerful and significant artwork released on the platform.

32:09.960 --> 32:15.000
You know, given that I'm a huge fan of generative art and I'm a huge fan of these artists,

32:15.000 --> 32:22.840
like for years I had followed these artists like way before Art Box existed and like the

32:22.840 --> 32:26.200
best thing that I could do that we could do as a platform in service of those artists

32:26.200 --> 32:32.440
was to make sure that all of the art on the platform was of a certain level of quality.

32:32.440 --> 32:37.880
So what happened is we started accepting only about 15% of the artworks that were submitted

32:37.880 --> 32:39.320
to Art Box.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.880
But because of the perception of what happened and last year there was a kind of a mad rush

32:43.880 --> 32:47.840
to Art Box, we couldn't keep anything live on the platform.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.120
Everything would sell out immediately, crazy prices.

32:50.120 --> 32:54.440
I mean, the FOMO and speculation was real and it was significant and it was really,

32:54.440 --> 32:58.080
I think it was a step back for Art Box and for generative art.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.800
Like I think it was detrimental to the long term meaning of this type of art.

33:02.800 --> 33:09.600
In other words, I would very much have preferred this kind of slope than this kind of slope

33:09.600 --> 33:16.040
because if you're very crypto enough, you know that everything goes up, comes down.

33:16.040 --> 33:21.440
We started getting responses from artists that were screened but not curated and say

33:21.440 --> 33:27.240
things like, well, I don't want to be released on the factory.

33:27.240 --> 33:31.360
I don't want to be released in like the second class, whatever thing.

33:31.360 --> 33:37.600
And A, I would take it way more personally than I should because a lot of my favorite

33:37.600 --> 33:39.760
artworks are in the factory.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.960
And factory, a lot of the artwork is incredible.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.040
It just wasn't pushing boundaries.

33:45.040 --> 33:48.240
And there's a lot of really good examples of things that are in the factory that had

33:48.240 --> 33:51.320
they been released six months earlier, they would have absolutely been curated.

33:51.320 --> 33:54.520
But if you see the progression of like pushing the boundaries of dinner to art and the curated

33:54.520 --> 33:58.480
section, you realize that like it could be a brilliant work within the art and an artist

33:58.480 --> 34:02.040
could have worked on it for years, months, whatever.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.680
And it still wasn't pushing a boundary for the medium.

34:05.680 --> 34:10.040
And so they wouldn't want to release it on Art Box and so then we'd see the artwork release

34:10.040 --> 34:11.040
on other platforms.

34:11.040 --> 34:18.480
And I'd be like, man, 15% acceptance rate is pretty elite, in my opinion, especially

34:18.480 --> 34:23.040
given that there's not a huge number of generative artists in the world.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.840
And it hurt.

34:24.840 --> 34:28.040
Like it hurt us, the team, to see that happen.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.560
It was like demoralizing.

34:29.560 --> 34:34.240
And to know that we might have like screened an artist in and they were like they were

34:34.240 --> 34:36.320
dissatisfied with like the experience.

34:36.320 --> 34:41.520
And what it made us go back to think about is like, okay, is the word factory a turnoff,

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
right?

34:42.520 --> 34:43.760
Like originally it was meant to be a factory.

34:43.760 --> 34:46.720
This is just anybody that can code can put art on the platform.

34:46.720 --> 34:53.240
But over time it was no longer just churning out meaning to churn out work or let anybody

34:53.240 --> 34:54.360
release.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.880
And so we started to second guess the word factory.

34:56.880 --> 35:03.120
We also realized that the curated that the playground badge and to explain playground

35:03.120 --> 35:06.280
or what we call heritage playground now was any work that was released.

35:06.280 --> 35:11.880
By an artist that had previously been curated because they had like a previous they had

35:11.880 --> 35:12.880
like a freeze period.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.880
They couldn't release new period of work six months or they couldn't submit to curation,

35:16.880 --> 35:19.040
but they could still have really great artwork.

35:19.040 --> 35:24.960
I think a lot of the work in the playground is and could very well be curated.

35:24.960 --> 35:30.200
I think for example, Meridian by Matt Deloria is one of my favorite pieces on our box period.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.440
And it's a playground piece, right?

35:31.440 --> 35:33.880
But to me that easily could have been a curated piece.

35:33.880 --> 35:40.680
It came sooner after his original release that it wasn't eligible to be curated.

35:40.680 --> 35:45.840
But what we're realizing is that playground actually became a designation for artists

35:45.840 --> 35:50.880
that had been previously curated more than a category in and of itself.

35:50.880 --> 35:55.920
And I also got a lot of communication as I, you know, I spent the year this year and

35:55.920 --> 36:02.280
last year essentially integrated in intermingling with both the traditional art world and the

36:02.280 --> 36:07.360
entity space and a lot of people would mention that they're confused even after someone explaining

36:07.360 --> 36:09.200
to them what the different categories were.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.560
They still felt confusion and uncertainty.

36:11.560 --> 36:17.160
And so the amazing team that I get to work with every single day at our box put our brains

36:17.160 --> 36:19.600
together and simplified it.

36:19.600 --> 36:23.400
And we really just, you know, changing the name from factory to presents is basically

36:23.400 --> 36:31.440
saying our blocks is presenting this work as a wonderful example of generative art.

36:31.440 --> 36:36.600
And the concept of playground is shifted to A, we have the heritage playground collection.

36:36.600 --> 36:42.360
But E, a playground project is something that that tag just means that that artists have

36:42.360 --> 36:43.360
been previously curated.

36:43.360 --> 36:47.840
And I do think that artists should be recognized for having achieved curation at some point

36:47.840 --> 36:50.320
or a curated project at some point in the process.

36:50.320 --> 36:54.120
So now we have those two categories curated.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.440
We also removed the designation for the series.

36:56.440 --> 37:02.680
In other words, we had series designations every quarter, it would be a new series.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.680
And the reason I did this is I did this for a lot of reasons.

37:04.680 --> 37:09.440
A, as a collector, I really always enjoyed collecting comic cards by series.

37:09.440 --> 37:16.560
Literally Marvel series one, series two and series three is the original reason the card

37:16.560 --> 37:23.200
collecting is the original kind of idea of coming up with a series.

37:23.200 --> 37:29.160
And then the series though became the other reason for the series was that somebody that

37:29.160 --> 37:35.040
may not be able to collect all curated art blocks pieces would be able to say and feel

37:35.040 --> 37:38.320
the satisfaction of having collected all of series one.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.320
So it was a compartmentalization.

37:39.320 --> 37:44.000
It was a way of enabling people to participate and have a set, something that I've always

37:44.000 --> 37:48.240
been drawn to is full sets, having a set of something and being able to say, look at my

37:48.240 --> 37:54.480
series three sets, even if they could not participate in all of them.

37:54.480 --> 37:58.160
What happened though is we had a very early project called elevated deconstructions, which

37:58.160 --> 38:03.080
gosh, the simplicity of that project is so special and also one of my favorite projects

38:03.080 --> 38:05.280
in art blocks.

38:05.280 --> 38:11.200
It was an addition of 200 and it demonstrated a bottleneck in collectability.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.880
And I don't have a problem with the bottleneck in collectability other than it's really good

38:14.880 --> 38:15.880
information.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.480
It was a really good reference point.

38:17.480 --> 38:22.560
For the future, when here we are saying we want to represent the best gender of art in

38:22.560 --> 38:29.880
the world, but the best gender of art might not actually do well at an addition of 1,000

38:29.880 --> 38:31.600
or 500.

38:31.600 --> 38:32.920
That may just not be the intent.

38:32.920 --> 38:37.080
Long form, while I love it, obviously everything from Fidezza to CryptoPunks and all these

38:37.080 --> 38:42.200
things, like I love the long form gender of art concept.

38:42.200 --> 38:48.560
I also remember early on screening projects that were incredible, but should not be an

38:48.560 --> 38:50.680
addition bigger than 50 or 100.

38:50.680 --> 38:54.720
So we got into this conundrum where we were like, hey, it would be really nice to release

38:54.720 --> 39:00.520
curated projects in addition to 50, 100, 200.

39:00.520 --> 39:05.880
As someone that was collecting one of every single curated drop, in fact, multiples of

39:05.880 --> 39:12.160
that, I realized also how terrifying it would be to be a collector and be presented with

39:12.160 --> 39:18.960
a curated drop of 50 and realize that in order to maintain this set, I would have to purchase

39:18.960 --> 39:22.560
something that was going to be in so potentially high demand.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.680
And so we dropped the series designation and now curated is just curated.

39:26.680 --> 39:31.120
So all of the heritage series went through eight.

39:31.120 --> 39:35.800
To me, fits inside of this really beautiful acrylic box of like, this is the roots, this

39:35.800 --> 39:39.120
is the beginning of our blocks, this is how we got started.

39:39.120 --> 39:47.120
You see a really clear progression in technical capabilities of projects over the course of

39:47.120 --> 39:48.680
that time.

39:48.680 --> 39:54.040
And then it ends at a point where we are now recognizing in art blocks that we want to

39:54.040 --> 40:00.560
be able to recognize a project is curated and have it be an addition of 50 or 100 or 200.

40:00.560 --> 40:05.920
And so moving forward, the curatorial board is asked what they recommend and we've been

40:05.920 --> 40:09.760
doing this for a little while now, what they recommend for addition size.

40:09.760 --> 40:14.160
And that is what within a plus or minus what the final edition will be.

40:14.160 --> 40:17.840
And I would love to see the curatorial board decide that something would be an addition

40:17.840 --> 40:22.760
of 50 or 100, obviously have the artist agree and sign off on that and see what it looks

40:22.760 --> 40:27.240
like to have something that we are considering to be the pioneering work in the field of

40:27.240 --> 40:30.240
gender of art, but in addition to 50.

40:30.240 --> 40:36.440
And that's where the series destination has been dropped, playground, factory destinations

40:36.440 --> 40:42.200
have been dropped and we now have our blocks curated, pushing boundaries, our box presents,

40:42.200 --> 40:46.960
incredible algorithmic, like I still consider them masterpieces.

40:46.960 --> 40:50.160
Then we have the collaboration section, which we're really proud of that right now we're

40:50.160 --> 40:55.080
currently deep in some collaborative projects with with face gallery, one of the leading

40:55.080 --> 40:56.440
art galleries in the world.

40:56.440 --> 41:01.240
And then most recently we added something I've been thinking about for a really long

41:01.240 --> 41:07.600
time, which is living in a new category called explorations and we added a project called

41:07.600 --> 41:12.040
a friendship bracelet, which is an exploration beyond just the artwork, although the artwork

41:12.040 --> 41:18.520
is to me the NFT is the artwork, but what it looks like to actually carry instructions

41:18.520 --> 41:24.720
in the same provenance and permanence of the Ethereum blockchain, integrate and embed instructions

41:24.720 --> 41:27.640
into an artwork on how to make a physical object.

41:27.640 --> 41:33.520
That doesn't fit the art for art itself narrative that we've really built and formulated for

41:33.520 --> 41:39.040
art blocks, but it definitely fits an exploration of what gender of art can and will be for

41:39.040 --> 41:40.040
the future.

41:40.040 --> 41:45.160
And so the team came up with this really wonderful category titled for explorations, where we

41:45.160 --> 41:51.760
will put things that art blocks is essentially dreaming up or commissioning ourselves.

41:51.760 --> 41:57.480
And so we commissioned the artist to in their style create this beautiful thing that may

41:57.480 --> 42:03.160
demonstrate something, whether it's a, you know, minting experience that you have to

42:03.160 --> 42:11.320
like visit somewhere to get to or a, you know, physical item that you can create giving back

42:11.320 --> 42:15.240
to our artists community in a way other than just releasing their work, commissioning their

42:15.240 --> 42:20.760
work and putting the kind of the weight of what we created in our blocks behind something

42:20.760 --> 42:26.680
that will generally hopefully be either always low cost or free.

42:26.680 --> 42:32.440
Obviously that could change as ideas and projects come into the fold.

42:32.440 --> 42:34.280
But yeah, really excited about that category.

42:34.280 --> 42:40.240
That's where we're really going to kind of spring into this future of art or content

42:40.240 --> 42:44.000
or design being created generatively beyond just like what the people's on the screen

42:44.000 --> 42:45.000
are.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
Amazing.

42:46.000 --> 42:53.120
Well, look forward to see how the next phase goes.

42:53.120 --> 43:01.680
Let's now go to, I guess, less technical practical questions, more conceptual ones.

43:01.680 --> 43:10.360
We're going to try and rally suit utilities faster and some slower.

43:10.360 --> 43:18.840
I had seen some work that the unit kind of two valuations team did.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.840
Art blocks is some gigantic percentage of the market cap of generative work.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.760
85% percent, 97, 83.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.880
It depends on the day.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.320
Is that good, bad?

43:30.320 --> 43:31.320
Does it matter?

43:31.320 --> 43:33.320
Is it healthy unhealthy?

43:33.320 --> 43:34.880
Does it matter?

43:34.880 --> 43:42.880
I mean, I think what matters is what happens and how this unfolds in five years and what's

43:42.880 --> 43:46.440
going to guide that is people's intentions.

43:46.440 --> 43:50.320
There's so many things that happen in the space.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.840
People get shamed for selling art.

43:52.840 --> 43:59.400
It's like, well, I never really intended on selling my crypto bunks when I got them.

43:59.400 --> 44:03.240
Then there are situations that arise where it makes a lot of sense.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.400
Number one, I got excited about creating art blocks.

44:05.400 --> 44:09.760
I would sell zombies for $200, $500, which is kind of crazy to think about to pay for

44:09.760 --> 44:10.760
that.

44:10.760 --> 44:15.840
Also, as a father of two, eventually someone gives you an offer for an NFT that you have

44:15.840 --> 44:19.680
a lot of and you say, okay, it would literally just be reckless for me not to accept this

44:19.680 --> 44:25.080
offer and change the trajectory of my family's life.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.400
Shaming is so bad.

44:27.400 --> 44:31.960
Also people get shamed off in for having very big collections.

44:31.960 --> 44:36.760
The reality is that these people will be stewards of this art and it's just way too early to

44:36.760 --> 44:38.880
tell how they will steward the art.

44:38.880 --> 44:41.280
I'll give you a perfect example.

44:41.280 --> 44:48.520
I know the owner of the Houdis Houdat account that owns over 1,000 Chromysquigles and I

44:48.520 --> 44:57.120
feel very confident in that person's intents and vision and alignment with me personally,

44:57.120 --> 44:59.920
with generative art and the future of the Chromysquigle.

44:59.920 --> 45:04.600
I feel like those squiggles are in really good hands.

45:04.600 --> 45:08.920
We don't always know who the person is on the other end and we don't always know what

45:08.920 --> 45:17.720
the intentions are of the person, the platform, the mechanic, but the space moves very quickly.

45:17.720 --> 45:23.360
It is only a matter of time before we start really understanding what that dominant position

45:23.360 --> 45:31.760
in generative and or crypto art will mean and it could very well be detrimental to the

45:31.760 --> 45:36.960
future of this space, but it could also be incredibly powerful if these people hold these

45:36.960 --> 45:43.680
collections, start displaying these collections and do great things with it.

45:43.680 --> 45:51.160
There's also the concept of fractionalization which on the one hand, I do die a little bit

45:51.160 --> 45:53.480
inside when someone fractionalizes a squiggle.

45:53.480 --> 45:57.800
It just feels weird.

45:57.800 --> 46:03.560
But then on the other hand, I think it's an incredibly powerful technology.

46:03.560 --> 46:04.560
It's brilliant.

46:04.560 --> 46:11.120
It's beautiful for democratization of art and obviously we have SEC, regulatory compliance

46:11.120 --> 46:14.080
type stuff which hopefully will be kind of worked through over the course of the next

46:14.080 --> 46:15.320
year or two.

46:15.320 --> 46:20.960
But as much as I am uncomfortable with the little squiggle being fractionalized, I actually

46:20.960 --> 46:27.520
am more excited about the power from a decentralized ownership perspective of the value proposition

46:27.520 --> 46:31.920
of fractionalizing, not just art, but anything in this space.

46:31.920 --> 46:40.920
That combination of the fractionalized stuff plus the stuff that's in high collection,

46:40.920 --> 46:48.440
I really think that we're going to see how that plays out over the next year or two.

46:48.440 --> 46:50.360
I think it's too early to tell.

46:50.360 --> 46:55.800
I'm a very optimistic person and I tend to believe that people do things for the right

46:55.800 --> 47:02.240
reasons for the most part and so I'm hoping for the best.

47:02.240 --> 47:04.760
Next question.

47:04.760 --> 47:13.160
There is a tremendous debate going on about royalties.

47:13.160 --> 47:17.400
One side of the debate is like, wait, this is one of the good things about the NFC space

47:17.400 --> 47:21.960
that artists can earn along with their collectors over time.

47:21.960 --> 47:26.880
And another side of the debate is basically like, oh, you're so naive.

47:26.880 --> 47:27.880
This is never going to work.

47:27.880 --> 47:31.640
I mean, effectively it's that it's dressed up in a lot of things about blockchains and

47:31.640 --> 47:34.360
code is long, whatever, but it basically is that.

47:34.360 --> 47:36.280
Wait, where are you in this topic?

47:36.280 --> 47:40.200
Oh, man, do we have an extra hour?

47:40.200 --> 47:41.440
I would say a couple of things.

47:41.440 --> 47:47.380
Number one, I think one of the things that really drove the point in for me was at a

47:47.380 --> 47:55.200
some point somebody on my Twitter feed referring to royalties as a transfer tax.

47:55.200 --> 48:00.520
You know, a lot of, and I think we live in a very broken society and so I'm not actually

48:00.520 --> 48:05.000
going to like speak highly of what's happening with our taxes, but a lot of the reason that

48:05.000 --> 48:10.320
taxes exist ideally is like, you know, to help pay for infrastructure and roads and things

48:10.320 --> 48:12.120
that we utilize.

48:12.120 --> 48:20.160
And generally, the word transfer tax to me is troublesome in the fact that like taxes

48:20.160 --> 48:24.680
when utilized correctly are for the greater good and benefit the greater good.

48:24.680 --> 48:28.680
But anyways, it's kind of an aside, but you know, oftentimes I see it referred to as a

48:28.680 --> 48:32.720
transfer tax and that kind of bugs me a little bit.

48:32.720 --> 48:37.440
I firmly believe that creator royalties are revolutionary.

48:37.440 --> 48:39.360
I think it's highly problematic.

48:39.360 --> 48:44.320
And you know, when I give lectures, I often, you know, I've gotten to speak to at this

48:44.320 --> 48:50.720
point, thousands of not tens of thousands of people this year to give higher education,

48:50.720 --> 48:54.120
giving lectures about generative art, NFTs, whatever.

48:54.120 --> 49:01.800
And I make it a point to point out that baked in has never existed for royalties, even though

49:01.800 --> 49:05.480
they're often referred to in articles as like being baked into the smart contract, baked

49:05.480 --> 49:07.000
into the artwork.

49:07.000 --> 49:11.720
They have and will always be a cultural norm.

49:11.720 --> 49:16.040
And you cannot force culture.

49:16.040 --> 49:17.040
You just can't.

49:17.040 --> 49:21.040
I just, I don't even care about smart contracts in this premise right now.

49:21.040 --> 49:28.200
I'm just talking about in human life and society, you cannot force culture.

49:28.200 --> 49:33.520
But when there's a really good culture, people rally and support around that culture.

49:33.520 --> 49:38.600
And whether that culture is, you know, I don't know what blue jeans were big in the 90s or

49:38.600 --> 49:46.720
whatever, or something relevant today, like royalties or environmental concerns, et cetera,

49:46.720 --> 49:53.360
people rally around culture, A, because no one can force them to rally around culture.

49:53.360 --> 49:57.320
Otherwise, it's not culture, it's technology.

49:57.320 --> 50:06.960
And the, you know, I'm speaking as one of the people with the highest vested interests,

50:06.960 --> 50:12.640
personally, in the perpetuation of secondary market royalties.

50:12.640 --> 50:16.600
I don't know what the charts would say, but I'd say that I'm pretty high up there in the

50:16.600 --> 50:19.520
charts of total royalties received as a creator.

50:19.520 --> 50:23.040
I also have a really high vested interest in platform royalties, right?

50:23.040 --> 50:30.800
So like Artbox also survives, partly because of royalties and, or creator fees or platform

50:30.800 --> 50:31.800
fees.

50:31.800 --> 50:37.120
And I guess I fail to understand, for example, if you want to go on an open C and you want

50:37.120 --> 50:41.400
to see your Artbox artwork, like Artbox artwork is intended to be on chain.

50:41.400 --> 50:43.600
It's reproducible from the blockchain, right?

50:43.600 --> 50:46.960
Like that to me is the value proposition of Artbox.

50:46.960 --> 50:54.120
The value proposition of Artbox from a consumer perspective is like this beautiful back end

50:54.120 --> 50:58.840
that our engineers have built out to like really make strong and enable people to mint

50:58.840 --> 51:02.960
and see, consume that generator already immediately.

51:02.960 --> 51:09.160
The ongoing server costs of hosting the previously generated artwork, and this is both for generative

51:09.160 --> 51:16.840
and IPFS based art, even though IPFS right now is fairly centralized and propped up.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.240
We have to pay for those services.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.520
So as a platform, you know, everyone's like, what's Artbox?

51:22.520 --> 51:26.160
I just, now we've been releasing a lot of really cool stuff at Artbox, but like for six

51:26.160 --> 51:31.080
months people were like, when marketing, when this, when that, it's like, there's actually

51:31.080 --> 51:34.080
a limitation to what one human can do.

51:34.080 --> 51:39.080
So in order for Artbox to have grown, Artbox had to grow in terms of a team in the terms

51:39.080 --> 51:40.080
of staff.

51:40.080 --> 51:43.080
So we're nearly 40 people now.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.400
We have two choices.

51:44.400 --> 51:50.560
We can have an ongoing revenue source that allows us to participate in our own success

51:50.560 --> 51:56.600
as a platform in the same way that the royalties concept enables an artist to participate in

51:56.600 --> 52:00.880
their own success as an individual.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.800
Or we have to sell more stuff.

52:04.800 --> 52:09.680
So the concept of Peter, Robin, Peter to pay Paul, in other words, oh man, we've got to

52:09.680 --> 52:11.680
pay all these server fees next next month.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.640
So let's just release a bunch of artwork.

52:13.640 --> 52:16.360
First of all, eventually that artwork just won't sell.

52:16.360 --> 52:21.080
There's actually limited amount of, there's a finite amount of money in the space, whether

52:21.080 --> 52:24.760
it be able to get to infinite sometimes or not.

52:24.760 --> 52:30.520
And so when something has to persist in perpetuity, you can choose to pay creator fees, to pay

52:30.520 --> 52:32.160
platform fees.

52:32.160 --> 52:36.360
And this is just kind of focusing on the platform fees for a second, so that when you

52:36.360 --> 52:41.960
want to go list your artwork on OpenSea, there is metadata, there is a image that appears

52:41.960 --> 52:45.400
in the OpenSea window or any other marketplace that you want.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.760
Or you can choose, say, hey, look, the value proposition of art box is actually the stuff

52:48.760 --> 52:49.960
is stored on chain.

52:49.960 --> 52:55.520
So when you go sell your NFT, let's not cut the artist and let's not cut the platform

52:55.520 --> 52:57.120
any percentages.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.000
But maybe you have to go to Etherscan and regenerate your art to see what you're about

53:01.000 --> 53:03.040
to buy or what you're about to sell.

53:03.040 --> 53:06.000
People want the art to appear.

53:06.000 --> 53:13.240
People want the art to be there so that they can utilize the fast-paced speculative concepts

53:13.240 --> 53:17.880
of NFT, because generally the people that fight the creator royalties are more on the,

53:17.880 --> 53:22.480
generally more on the speculative side, not always, but generatively, generally.

53:22.480 --> 53:30.000
But you want the facility of being able to transact on a marketplace, but you don't actually

53:30.000 --> 53:36.360
want to acknowledge that somebody had to pay for that image appearing in your browser.

53:36.360 --> 53:40.760
And the more popular art box is, and I'm just using art boxes as an example, but this can

53:40.760 --> 53:47.040
be applied further, the more resources that are required to serve that image and to generate

53:47.040 --> 53:51.560
those algorithms and to produce algorithmic outputs.

53:51.560 --> 54:00.600
And so to me, it is very simple that the platform would benefit from more people utilizing the

54:00.600 --> 54:07.920
platform and that there would be a perpetual reward for the platform, for perpetually

54:07.920 --> 54:10.440
hosting the artwork.

54:10.440 --> 54:14.360
To me that feels very simple and straightforward.

54:14.360 --> 54:20.360
And that's hard to argue with, right?

54:20.360 --> 54:26.520
Go download your art and put it on IPFS and then let the platform not need to continue

54:26.520 --> 54:28.560
hosting your artwork if you don't want to pay those fees.

54:28.560 --> 54:32.320
Now, when you go to the artist, it's a bit more complex, right?

54:32.320 --> 54:41.960
Because the beauty of artist royalties are not apparent other than the artist making money

54:41.960 --> 54:45.040
until the norm has existed for a while.

54:45.040 --> 54:53.640
So I often say I consider myself an outlier when I talk about creator royalties.

54:53.640 --> 54:58.320
I don't think that I still wake up wondering if everything that's happening is real or

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
not.

54:59.320 --> 55:02.400
And I've said before, I'm not someone that's driven by money.

55:02.400 --> 55:05.280
And so I have a very different perspective, I think.

55:05.280 --> 55:10.800
Then a lot of people, and I have nothing against people that are drawn and driven by making

55:10.800 --> 55:15.000
money, in fact, I think that's probably the normal way to operate and I consider myself

55:15.000 --> 55:16.400
kind of a weirdo in that sense.

55:16.400 --> 55:23.080
But I've also had a lot of success with some of the NFTs that I've acquired and subsequently

55:23.080 --> 55:26.960
accepted offers that we're life-changing for.

55:26.960 --> 55:32.520
Now, take that number, this crazy outlier number that maybe artists like myself and

55:32.520 --> 55:37.600
X-copy and some of the bigger, generative artists in this space are making and cut that by a

55:37.600 --> 55:39.520
hundred.

55:39.520 --> 55:46.560
And now consider what that amount of money, whether it's 50 bucks or $500, a week would

55:46.560 --> 55:50.720
do for someone that is making a living on art.

55:50.720 --> 55:57.360
First of all, one of the most prideful moments for me in the world of art box so far is the

55:57.360 --> 56:03.920
fact that there are now dozens of artists that created art, that were creatives part-time

56:03.920 --> 56:07.720
or as a hobby that have been able to quit their job to pursue artful time.

56:07.720 --> 56:15.000
And back to trusting artists, artists generally have good intentions and we need more art

56:15.000 --> 56:16.000
in this world.

56:16.000 --> 56:19.680
We need more conversation about art, we need more critique about art in this space.

56:19.680 --> 56:20.680
We need more artists.

56:20.680 --> 56:23.680
The world doesn't hurt when you have more artists.

56:23.680 --> 56:29.640
The world might hurt when you have more other types of professions but not artists.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.640
So let's get more artists out there.

56:33.640 --> 56:40.680
There's such a psychological issue when you as an artist, I'll put it this way, I never

56:40.680 --> 56:42.720
thought that royalties would be where they are today.

56:42.720 --> 56:46.680
But man, when I released ChromiSqueals, they were $10 apiece.

56:46.680 --> 56:50.080
And last I checked, they were $22,000 apiece.

56:50.080 --> 56:57.480
I think it's incredibly difficult to understand and process how somebody would think that

56:57.480 --> 57:04.880
it's okay psychologically for someone to create something and sell it for $10 and see somebody

57:04.880 --> 57:11.360
else sell it for hundreds if not thousands of times what it was originally sold for.

57:11.360 --> 57:15.680
Yeah, I priced it at $10 because I was happy with that price point and that's great.

57:15.680 --> 57:26.360
But artists have historically watched other people profit exponentially on their work

57:26.360 --> 57:35.080
and their craft and this technology enables us through cultural mechanisms to perpetuate

57:35.080 --> 57:40.720
a process where artists now get to participate in their own success.

57:40.720 --> 57:47.000
And whether that's $50 a week or $5,000 a week, it doesn't actually matter because the

57:47.000 --> 57:53.280
$50 a week extra for an artist over the course of 10 years instead of releasing hundreds

57:53.280 --> 57:56.960
of artworks because they need to continue to put food on the table.

57:56.960 --> 58:02.200
It's like you have accumulated a little bit of IP for every artwork that you have released

58:02.200 --> 58:08.080
and in the long run, art will thrive because there's less pressure.

58:08.080 --> 58:13.840
There's just in some cases a little bit and in other cases a lot less pressure to produce.

58:13.840 --> 58:16.160
And I can speak from experience.

58:16.160 --> 58:19.880
I have this project being released in Mexico City in two weeks.

58:19.880 --> 58:25.360
I generally am a fairly overwhelmed person with art blocks and just the space in general

58:25.360 --> 58:30.720
and a family and I committed to releasing an artwork and I'm actually very proud of it.

58:30.720 --> 58:34.120
But the amount of time that I've had to spend on it is insane.

58:34.120 --> 58:39.640
And the idea that I would rush through something like that because I needed to sell my next

58:39.640 --> 58:45.800
thing, the same idea that art blocks would have to sell more art to pay for ongoing

58:45.800 --> 58:53.320
surgeries for employees to grow the team versus letting the artwork continue to give in a

58:53.320 --> 58:57.560
small percentage for the perpetuity of the assistance of that artwork.

58:57.560 --> 59:05.160
To me, it's hard to understand why people would have such a strong opposition to that.

59:05.160 --> 59:08.440
And I empathize with everybody.

59:08.440 --> 59:13.000
I empathize with people that are selling an entity for less than what they paid for it.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.320
Sometimes as the crypto prunks project has demonstrated and some early art blocks projects

59:18.320 --> 59:22.560
have demonstrated, people act as if somebody held a gun to their head in order to make

59:22.560 --> 59:27.280
a purchase and make an acquisition versus them taking responsibility for purchasing

59:27.280 --> 59:28.280
the thing that they purchased.

59:28.280 --> 59:32.200
If I buy a house for a million bucks today and I have to sell it for half a million bucks

59:32.200 --> 59:38.520
next year, you bet the realtor is going to make their commission regardless of whether

59:38.520 --> 59:40.720
I made money on it or not.

59:40.720 --> 59:42.880
And there's a lot of other examples of that in society.

59:42.880 --> 59:48.600
So I just think that like, royalties are cultural norms, there's this beautiful opportunity

59:48.600 --> 59:50.120
to like change things.

59:50.120 --> 59:54.280
There's this beautiful opportunity in this nascent space to be more giving, to be more

59:54.280 --> 59:58.320
charitable, to build that culture into what we're doing as artists, as platforms.

59:58.320 --> 01:00:04.400
There's a beautiful opportunity in this nascent space to try to be more inclusive and diverse,

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:08.680
to concentrate on gender diversity.

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:15.640
There's an opportunity here and it may or may not materialize, but if it doesn't, I

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:19.720
personally will look back at it as a missed opportunity.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:25.160
And that is the same with royalties, with charitable giving, with inclusivity and all

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.680
sorts of other parts of this.

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:32.120
It's like we are at the very root of something that could be revolutionary.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.200
It already is in some cases for this entire planet.

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:42.080
We are stewards of this and this is an opportunity for us to really put things forward in the

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:47.640
best way in a way that makes sense for the longevity of the artwork, for the artists,

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:50.080
for the artists estate.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:55.680
When I'm long gone, the fact that my children may benefit from this thing that I created

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.480
today, gosh, that feels good.

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:07.560
And I feel like it's a cultural norm and no smart contract restrictions and no shaming

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:17.880
and no overall fomo bullying speculation in the space is going to enforce that.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:24.120
It's cultural and the more it remains cultural, I think the longer that it's going to remain

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:29.560
as a norm and we need to fight for that and we need to fight for the culture.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:36.280
Last example, because I could speak on this for a long time, the thing that fascinates

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.440
me the most is when a collector purchases a Chromies Google OTC from a seller that doesn't

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:43.440
want to pay royalties, right?

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:46.240
Like they just don't want to deal with the market, they don't want to pay royalties and

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:50.680
the collector sends me the royalties, not the seller, but the buyer.

01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.760
And I don't think that royalties should be imposed upon the buyer.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.160
I actually think that they're perfectly fine on the collector.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.520
The fact that there is a cultural, because at this point there's nothing I can do to

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:07.760
control it, there's a cultural drive that the collector has to take a moment, send me

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:11.920
a message on Twitter and say, hey, what's your e-federis and what's our blocks as e-federis

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:17.240
so that I can send these royalties, these creator fees, these platform fees.

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:25.640
Man, that speaks so much more than the opposite, which is in my opinion, trying to institute

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:33.200
contract level restrictions in this space, because the more you try to restrict somebody,

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.240
look, if you want to be decentralized, then you be decentralized.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.880
If it's decentralized, that means that you can't actually impose some of these rules.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:45.240
And the more you try to create rules, and this is very often visible in our political

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.960
system in the United States, for example, the more you try to impose rules, the more

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:55.200
you try to shame someone, the more you try to implicate people in things, the more defiant

01:02:55.200 --> 01:03:02.840
they get, and the more vitriol they have in defending that right or that ability.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:11.800
And to me, it is almost encouraging defiance to try to impose something.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.120
And okay, this is really the last thing I'll say.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:20.400
Our blocks released a rule last year where you can only mint one NFT per wallet, because

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.840
things were getting out of control with bots.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:22.840
You know what that did?

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:27.600
It made it to where people wrote bots that minted 100 NFTs with 100 different wallets.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.120
Like, what was I thinking?

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.320
Thinking that I could get in the middle of a decentralized technology and try to fix

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:35.240
something that was actually unfixable.

01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.880
There is actually no solution.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.440
People would yell on this score, what about the bots?

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440
What are you doing about the bots?

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:44.240
Like, there was actually no solution, but we felt so pressured to accommodate and to

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.000
understand people's frustrations.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.400
And it worked for the first two or three drops.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.200
But then after that, it all went to shit.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.400
And today, we don't actually know how many humans own our block pieces, because we encouraged,

01:03:55.400 --> 01:04:00.120
we shot ourselves in the foot and we encouraged people to generate new wallets because they

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.680
wanted to mint more than one NFT.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.240
And if that had been a successful tactic, then I would have a different opinion on some

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.720
of the restrictions that are happening in the NFT space today with royalties.

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.040
But it was unsuccessful because we knew deep down inside that it could be circumvented.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.480
You cannot block someone from selling an NFT without royalties.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:26.120
You cannot block someone from minting only one NFT or force someone to mint only one

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.080
NFT.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.800
You can create hurdles.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:34.960
You can make it, you can encumber them with other tasks to pull it off.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:40.200
But as long as we're celebrating decentralization, you can't prevent it in a fully decentralized

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200
manner.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:45.760
And to us, at our box in general, we believe in the fact that an NFT is a sovereign fair

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:51.040
asset and something that we do not have any say in once it's minted.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:55.560
And so we hope that people will continue to perpetuate the royalty conversation as a cultural

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:59.080
norm in support of artists and support of creators.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.920
And what we're going to do is we're going to, instead of trying to punish people for

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:06.480
acting in a way that doesn't feel right to us, we're going to reward people.

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:12.320
And how that looks, I don't know, maybe in a far distant future, I, as snowflake, do a

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:19.720
drop and allow this people that have participated in the royalty convention or the cultural

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.120
standard and don't allow people that don't.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:23.120
I don't know.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.120
I'm not saying I'm going to do that.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.720
It's just because of the beauty of the transparency, it's like, you know, we can fight decentralization

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:29.160
or we can totally embrace it.

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.000
There's a beautiful transparency.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:35.440
And that transparency is something that will enable us as a platform to reward the people

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.000
that are perpetuating this cultural standard that has really changed so many different

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.000
people's lives.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.440
Whoa, that's quite an answer.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.440
Sorry.

01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:47.400
It's just top of mind.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.200
I also don't want to get into a Twitter debate with like thousands of people that feel so

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:52.440
strongly about this.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:58.640
And I, you know, I really don't think it's wrong to impose creator royalties at the

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.120
smart contract level.

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:06.360
I just don't, I just, you know, a lot of times it's posed as, you know, in support of the

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360
artist.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.680
But I think long term, it's actually maybe detrimental.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.280
And so we just don't want to perpetuate it in our blocks.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:18.240
I do love the idea that an artist is taking a stand by imposing contract level restrictions.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:19.960
I think they're sending a strong signal.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.720
It's a very important signal.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:25.640
And I think that that should exist and should continue to exist.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:30.040
But for a platform that is relying on fully on decentralization of algorithms stored

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:36.040
on chain, it feels like the wrong move for us at our blocks to impose that kind of stuff.

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:40.160
And it feels like we've already learned our lesson with a one per wallet limit and we

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.240
will continue to embrace decentralization as much as possible.

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:51.080
So I have a question that is a, it's kind of the same question.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:56.400
Though it might seem like there's two different things.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:04.520
PFP projects to some greater or lesser degree have managed to create some level of community

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.760
around the tokens of the project.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:22.360
One of X seem like they could do that in somehow a similar way in a way that just pure one

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:31.440
of ones might not because there's like a natural community there.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:40.040
And the, but I do think most generative artists have treated, you know, one of one of X is

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:44.800
very new and interesting and onshade and amazing and differentiated.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:49.240
But most I think of the artworks artists have treated, okay, you've got a piece of my art.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.240
You have a piece of my art.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.240
That's fine.

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:59.800
I don't know that there has been a ton of innovation thinking about do we want to do

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.040
more with my thousand holders of whatever.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:07.400
Hazers take something in the news this week, right?

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.360
It still feels a little bit unidirectional from the artists to the collector.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.160
I think relevant to this question and it's not the same question.

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.040
It's a different question, but it's kind of the same question.

01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.320
You don't see a ton of CC zero projects because the logic of a CC zero project, I think tends

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:31.640
to be that well, there'll be a broader engagement within and outside the community to bring

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.960
this lore into the public sphere, the global digital commons, et cetera.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.360
And I think one of those kind of come from the same place.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.160
To be honest, that it's still a fairly traditional.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:47.120
I've made a piece of art and you've bought it and I hope you display it nicely.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.960
And it kind of stops there.

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:58.600
But my question is, and noting that this is still all very unknown and un clarified even

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.560
in the PFP space, but could you imagine some version of these techniques that we're seeing

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:12.440
in the PFP space somehow applied to a generative art collection?

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:16.520
So I imagine a lot with the Chrome's Google and I think that Chrome's Google might be

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:24.520
one of the more hybrid in the fact that it's a larger edition and it is often regarded

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.720
as representing something or representing a community.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:33.120
And lately a lot of people are saying that it kind of represents NFTs in a way which

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:40.760
I would never put that cloak on just because I would want to be so whatever.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:47.880
But I think that, okay, well first of all, it's your first question.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.640
It does feel a little unidirectional for a couple of reasons.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:54.160
Number one, it's all very new.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.440
So we're just getting started here.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.320
Also artists creating art for the sake of art itself have generally just made art for

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.320
the sake of art itself.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.720
That's what they have done.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:14.360
It is the ones that are thinking about the secondary implications that are really going

01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.600
to blow people's minds.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.760
And so I agree in some cases that it feels unidirectional, but I also don't necessarily

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.480
think that is a problem.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.720
I think some artists, and this, man, this goes to the CC0 debate, the licensing debate,

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:35.400
it's kind of like people should be held accountable for what they set out to do and following

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:38.760
through with anything that they promised to set out to do.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:44.400
People should not be held accountable for a fantasy of what someone thinks somebody should

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.320
do because that's what they think is the right thing to do.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:52.360
And so if an artist sets out to release an artwork, and it's really good artwork, the

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.640
people buy it, and the artist doesn't reward that community, other than actually being

01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:03.560
in the discord and talking about their art, which I think is actually like a very beautiful

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:06.240
utility that's built into specifically art block artworks.

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:09.240
And not all artists stick around, but a lot of them do, especially when they have a great

01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:10.720
reception of their art.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.560
They're on Twitter, they engage.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:22.520
What other, I mean, I can't text or get on discord with Damien Hirst, let's say, or other

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:28.120
major artists at will, whereas in this space, part of the utility is just the artist being

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.120
present.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:37.600
I think that as artists form their careers, and they realize that there's an opportunity

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:47.360
in this space to develop a slightly different career path than the traditional artist does.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:53.280
If you apply the concepts of creativity that are required to make beautiful works of art,

01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:00.160
and you then zoom out and realize that this entire movement is in and of itself a really

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:07.680
interesting conceptual performance artwork.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:14.000
I think when you start seeing artists apply creativity to the concept, to the community,

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:23.960
to the, like, just experience, we're going to be blown away, and we're going to be really

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:27.080
rewarded for having been a collector of that artist.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.880
And not all artists are going to do that, and that's okay.

01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:33.120
A lot of artists are still in shock for the amount of money that they made on their artwork.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:36.440
A lot of artists didn't want to make that much money on their artwork, especially last

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.080
year when things were crazy.

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.200
Like there's some serious mental health concerns that we address all the time internally at

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.160
art blocks for the team, for the artists, even for the collectors, all of them because

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.760
of the insanity of the space.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.680
But ultimately, I don't think artists or people should ever be held accountable to do anything

01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.640
with their artwork beyond what they originally set out to do.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:13:03.240
And if they do, it should be celebrated and appreciated as, like, icing on the cake.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:13.560
And as an example, I definitely am incredibly terrified of Fogo and speculation, and somebody

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:17.440
texted me yesterday and told me, Skrillex had all time high, and part of me wants to celebrate,

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:20.720
and part of me literally just wants to go hide under a rock, because the more people pay

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.120
for these things, the more entitled that they will get.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.000
So right now, I think it's still reasonable, and art blocks is just hitting milestone after

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.960
milestone, and people feel that things are happening, and I guess they attribute some

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.640
of the success of art blocks to the success of the Chromie Squiggles, and vice versa.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.120
But then things slow down.

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.120
And it's completely predictable.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:46.520
It's as predictable as the sun rising, that if the price of the Chromie Squiggle starts to

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:52.200
drop, people will start saying, and this happened earlier, I remember when punks, I

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:56.240
mean, when apes rose dramatically, and someone's like, what's interesting?

01:13:56.240 --> 01:14:01.720
Skrillex and apes, and someone's response on Twitter was, apes know how to market, and

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.560
I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to market.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:07.160
I'm not going to go out and market this squiggle.

01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:13.280
All the things that are happening, to me, feel very organic.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:18.400
I just, you know, I would like in the future to do really nice things for Skrillex holders.

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.320
I don't feel that it's appropriate for me to do that until the entire collection just

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:23.120
mentioned out for what it's worth.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.880
And I definitely don't want to like suggest that I'm going to do that because I'm fully

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.000
cognizant of what that could potentially do for the value of the Chromie Squiggles.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.320
If I said anyone with a Chromie Squiggle is going to be able to mint an artwork of my next year,

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:42.520
which is absolutely not what I'm doing to be clear, it could potentially increase the

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.680
value of the Chromie Squiggle.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:49.160
And that is not a good reason for the value of the Chromie Squiggle to go up if it's something

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.840
that I've created to be a work of art for the Seagorn itself.

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:59.720
It's okay to have platforms like Proof and V-Friends promise future value in terms of

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:01.280
utility of air drops.

01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:07.400
That's okay because they have the resources to perpetuate that, to continue to do that.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:11.560
Not a lot of people can, but I fully believe that, you know, the Kevin Rose's and Gary

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:19.880
V's of this world can continue to delight their communities with things over time.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.120
But the art that's created for the Seagorn itself, like it doesn't feel like it should

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.040
be required to do that.

01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.040
But you and I both know that in the event that an artist were to do something delightful

01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.520
like that, it would be welcomed and received and celebrated and appreciated.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:43.320
And generally, as artists, we like to do things that make people happy.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:44.320
I do, at least.

01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:46.120
Like, I'm literally, that's what I do.

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:49.760
I like to try to do whatever I can to make people smile and make people happy.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:53.680
And so the opportunities will come in the future to delight the people that are supporters

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.680
of my work.

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:58.560
And I would like to do that.

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.880
But the moment someone starts forcing me to do that or say that I owe them something is

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:09.080
detrimental to my desire as an artist to do that.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:13.560
And I think this is a big problem with the CryptoPunks community and why eventually the

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:16.240
larval labs team sold the IP.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:20.160
It's like, you know, you create this thing and then the world tells you what to do with

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.800
your baby.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:26.280
And if you don't want to do it, the world tells you that you're an idiot or that you're stupid

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:32.160
or that you're wrong or that you're, you know, extract whatever they might want to say.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:36.280
And that wasn't the original intention of the artwork.

01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:40.520
So I don't think that anybody owes anybody anything other than what they promised when

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:42.160
they set out to do stuff.

01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.320
We've been very, very careful at our blogs and I'm very careful with my artwork in particular

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.320
to never promise anybody any future value.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:54.600
You know, the friendship-based project that we just released is an example of value for

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.680
our blogs collectors.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.920
But it's not intended to be some speculative thing.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.800
But if it has value one day, that's great.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:01.800
That's fantastic.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.600
But we never promised it to anybody.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.120
We never made anybody buy an art box artwork in order to live deemed or to receive this

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.120
air drop.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.680
We delighted people with these really nice things that recognize people's participation

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.080
in this space.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:17.960
I think it's only been two years for art box artists.

01:17:17.960 --> 01:17:21.920
I think of all of the art box artists, not that many have quit their job, but the ones

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:26.000
that have quit their jobs will find ways to delight the people that have collected their

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.000
work.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.120
If anything, to make them want to be repeat customers of that work.

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:33.360
And so I think those opportunities just haven't been explored yet.

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:36.080
It feels like we've been doing this for a couple of decades, but it's only been a year

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.560
and a half to years.

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:43.280
And I think we need to give people a little bit of space and time to kind of really think

01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.280
about.

01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:47.200
I think a lot of the artists that released art on our blogs literally have no idea what's

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.480
about to happen to them.

01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:51.600
And oftentimes they talk about that moment when they unpause the project and how their

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:56.840
life has changed ever since, not just financially, but also pressure, but also community.

01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:02.120
They have like fans and we should let humans take a moment to absorb everything that's

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.120
happening.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:09.640
I'll be the first to say that I personally have not, I can't stress this enough, I have

01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:16.520
not been able to take a moment and reflect and absorb and understand everything that's

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:20.280
happening.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:25.560
We're humans and we need time to understand and it's going to take a long time to understand

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.160
exactly what happens.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:32.040
And once the people that want to continue in this space understand what those implications

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:38.480
are, I'm pretty confident it will stop feeling so unidirectional and it'll start feeling

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.400
a lot more dynamic.

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.560
And in the meantime, you know, again, like no one's forcing anyone to buy anything, but

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.640
damn, like I've collected a bunch of art blogs, I think they're beautiful works of

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.520
genital art and buying art for the sake of art itself feels like the right thing to do.

01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:53.720
And if it goes up in value, would they great?

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.920
And if it doesn't, you know, I have to build 20 houses at this point just to show what

01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:03.080
genital art collection or, you know, just build a big metaverse and show it all there.

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.120
So anyways, I'm kind of rambling there, but I just think that there's a certain amount

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.840
of entitlement in the space and holding anybody accountable for anything beyond what they

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:15.120
set out to do feels wrong to me.

01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:18.200
But I'm someone that's pretty laissez-faire and I believe that, you know, people should

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.800
do what they want with their bodies and people should just, you know, as long as they're doing

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.800
good, they should be allowed to make their own decisions.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.840
Okay.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:36.040
My last question is this because I know we've delayed you to your next meeting and I want

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:37.040
to do that.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:43.920
My last question is what question should I have asked you, but I didn't.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920
Ooh.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:51.920
Oh, man, you've asked some good ones.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:56.040
Some very pertinent ones.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.440
Yeah.

01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.760
You didn't ask me who my favorite art blocks artist is, which is something I'm very grateful

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:04.760
for.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.240
I don't know if you can get that question and have to like pick a child, like my favorite

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.240
child.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.240
Yeah, that's it.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:13.240
I don't know.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.040
I think you nailed it.

01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040
Okay.

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.720
Well, thank you so much for joining us.

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.920
We very much appreciate the time.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.960
The insight, I will say I can't.

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:37.200
I couldn't be more excited about the future of generative art, both in the net, both

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:43.400
as art, but then I think in other digital objects that will become generative.

01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:45.960
And then maybe as you say in the long run, we'll figure out how we do this in the physical

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.960
world as well.

01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:52.520
But in the meantime, for sure, for virtual goods, this will absolutely happen.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.160
And I mean, one mental model I have, I think it's, it makes the world a more beautiful

01:20:58.160 --> 01:20:59.160
place.

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:00.160
Absolutely.

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:05.080
And that just so literally makes the world a more beautiful place, a more unique and diverse

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:10.880
and, you know, just dynamic, dynamic world.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:14.600
And I can't wait to see everybody wearing friendship bracelets next time I see you.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:16.120
All right, sir.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:17.680
Thank you so much.

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:20.640
Thank you so much for having me.

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:25.440
I appreciate it.

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.040
Hello.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:30.840
Hi, hi.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:32.800
Hi.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.400
Good morning, good evening.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.880
Good morning to you, I guess.

01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:40.320
Good evening here in Europe.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:45.400
Thank you very much for this amazing discussion you've had with 6'5 to 9", with just what's

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.360
that and it was really brilliant.

01:21:49.360 --> 01:22:00.040
As you might know, we ask our guests if they can to spend a few more minutes with us taking

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:01.520
questions from our students.

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.080
So thank you very much for being here for that.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:13.640
Just a note for the people that are listening to us now either on the OM or YouTube.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:19.480
As always, please post your questions either in the OM chat or on Twitter using the hashtag

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.640
NFTQNA.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:30.320
Please don't post live questions on YouTube because we're not monitoring that chat.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:35.720
So let me start off with a number of questions from the students already.

01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:43.840
Some of them are quite practical, let's say, regarding how our blocks operates.

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:51.200
But rather start with the discussion you just had with, I mean, we just heard the discussion

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.240
that you've had with 6'5 to 9", regarding royalties.

01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:01.960
I know that you sort of had the... yeah, it's a hot topic for everyone.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.880
I see lots of discussions in the chat while you were discussing with 6'5 to 9".

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:13.480
So I know you advocated for a more, let's say, less effort or kind of cultural norm approach

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:21.200
to how this thing is going to be resolved instead of, let's say, imposing restrictions

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:23.640
on smart contracts.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:29.000
But I'd like to ask you, in the decentralized world and especially in the original Bitcoin

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:37.760
communities and everything, there was this mode of code is low and that rules should

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:42.600
be embedded in smart contracts and be respected by everyone because otherwise it's going to

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600
be clear.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:49.720
So how do you feel regarding this?

01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:58.760
Can we trust the collective to come up with a unified homogeneous like, resolved to this

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:06.240
question or should we at some point agree on what should happen and make it on the contract

01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:07.240
level?

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:13.720
Well, number one, I just want people to understand that this will never actually be resolved.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:18.240
This will never be something that is just stamped, done, finished, move on.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:27.400
Number two, I do believe that code should be law, but only when the code can be law.

01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:34.440
And so we embrace decentralization, we embrace the sovereignty of owning these things in

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.440
a way that really didn't exist before you.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:38.360
I mean, we couldn't own digital assets before.

01:24:38.360 --> 01:24:39.360
We can't.

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:48.040
We can provably own the digital asset, but we can't provably force anyone to pay a

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.800
royalty.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.600
You can't block someone from operating without paying a royalty.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.720
You can hamper their efforts.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.800
You can make it difficult.

01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:03.400
You can make it complicated, but you can't block it unless you get really restrictive

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.040
and you start actually putting restrictions on the ability to transfer an NFT with permission.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:14.520
So there is a world where you can actually guarantee royalties, but you'd have to restrict

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.760
the ability to transfer.

01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:18.000
And so I'll give you an example.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.960
Last year I created this kind of, I worked with a consultant created this crazy level

01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:30.520
of security, cold storage, two week delay for all of my R-blocks NFTs.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:36.800
And then I transferred 2,400 R-blocks NFTs to this wallet.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:43.840
And it would feel pretty weird to me if there was some mechanism required for me to have

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.480
approval in order for me to transfer.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:47.840
I wasn't selling them.

01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:51.480
No royalty should be paid when you transfer from one wallet to the other.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:57.560
But you have to transfer your assets every now and then imagine someone gets hacked,

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.560
compromised.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.520
And you're watching stuff happening and I guess you need approval that even the hacker

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.520
can't steal your NFTs.

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:08.000
I guess that's maybe that's a good thing right there.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.040
But yeah, I mean, ultimately I don't know that unless you go to those levels of restrictions,

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.400
which what happens if the approver loses their keys?

01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.960
Are you no longer able to transfer your NFT again?

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:26.040
You know, there's a lot of things that make me uncomfortable with that level of control.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:31.600
And if you don't go to that level of control, then code is not law.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.400
And unfortunately if code is not law, I believe that we're encouraging people to act in a

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:40.120
way that will prove that code is not law.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:45.040
Because that's generally how society likes to be both good people and bad people.

01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.160
They like to show and prove that their position is valid.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:57.920
And that's one position that seems very easy to prove that you can get around these restrictions

01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.160
at any point.

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:05.000
And there's a lot of arguments that it's hard to get around the restrictions and it is.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:10.680
It's actually really kind of annoying to try to figure out how to get through, how to wrap an NFT.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:15.720
But it only gets easier as people build tools to make it easier.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.680
And over time, my opinion is that, you know, there's this thought that like, you know,

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.280
our royalty is going to zero.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:27.000
I don't actually think or I can't tell you with certainty that I'm correct.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:28.720
But I think there's actually two paths.

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:35.280
I think that there's a path that royalties go to zero because people try to enforce royalties

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:39.480
at the smart contract level in a way that's completely impossible to enforce unless we

01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.240
restrict transfer ship.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:47.160
And then there's the other path where royalties go to zero because of the cultural, you know,

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.520
because we believe that we should reward people that operate in good behavior and then everybody

01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:53.640
just becomes a bad, you know, actor, I guess.

01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:57.200
I don't think that people that don't pay royalties are bad humans.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.200
By the way, I just, everybody has their motives for being in the space, right?

01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.320
And that's what we need to understand.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:08.640
But I think for someone to stand up and say, this is the way for royalties not to go to

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.640
zero.

01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:18.520
And the other way, the potential culturally sensitive, non-restrictive, you know, positive

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:20.200
reinforcement way is the wrong way.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:27.440
I feel like that's actually a pretty bold statement to make also.

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:31.360
And I don't, again, there's no solution here.

01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.520
And I think it's just more of like, let's see how it goes.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:41.400
We've been told that art blocks, artworks consistently have a higher percentage of sales

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.960
that include a royalty than a lot of others.

01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:49.720
And I think that this narrative that we've pushed so hard, I mean, to the point of dying

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:56.000
on a hill of buy the art for the sake of art itself, like support the artists, participate

01:28:56.000 --> 01:29:03.720
in this new thing of collecting art and understanding art and whatever, that seems to have an implication

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:08.720
towards people's desire to want to continue to support the artists.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:14.680
And I guess the last thing I'd say is if somebody wants to sell a Chromie Squiggle and

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:20.920
do not pay, like just so adamant about not paying a Chromie Squiggle royalty, not sending

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:29.240
me fees or not sending art block their fees, like, I just can't imagine, you know, reaching

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:31.000
out and be like, you're an asshole.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.400
It's just, it is what it is.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.880
Like we just need to kind of embrace it and work through it.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:36.880
I agree.

01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:38.640
Very related question.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.080
I think you sort of answered it, but I'm going to ask it anyway.

01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:48.120
Aside from what you think is fair or desired, what do you think will eventually happen?

01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:52.280
Where is the royalties narrative converging to?

01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:53.280
I think that's interesting.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:59.280
I can't remember if I mentioned in the interview before, but a lot of royalties that I receive

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:01.680
and art blocks receives, because this is really interesting, right?

01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.080
We have two parties here.

01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:06.880
We have two interested parties and some people would make an argument that the creator fees

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.720
are more important than the platform fees.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.280
And obviously, we want to support the creators.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.360
Also, people want upgrades and updates to our blocks and they want us to grow the platform,

01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.040
make it bigger and grow the team and give you more features.

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:23.800
And so, you know, we also have to be cognizant of the fact that these, you know, the expansion

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:30.160
of the platform sometimes requires revenue.

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:37.080
I think that given that a lot of collectors sometimes will purchase a Squiggle from a person

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:38.920
that doesn't want to pay royalties.

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.080
And the purchaser takes it upon themselves to reach out to me to request the information

01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:49.560
to send the royalties is a demonstration of this being a completely unenforceable cultural

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:55.160
norm where the creator and the collector are creating a long-term relationship that

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.880
is going to be mutually beneficial.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:07.840
That collector is making sure that, you know, as I release new work, maybe I'm going to

01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:08.840
ask them for feedback.

01:31:08.840 --> 01:31:11.680
I mean, this is actually a pertinent example.

01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.720
There's a collecting group that reached out to semi-royalties for a Squiggle they recently

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:21.600
purchased and I was like, by the way, I'm working on this project for Mexico City, for

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.840
Bright Moments, you know, I'd love to get your feedback on it.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.160
And they got a bit of an early view on it and they got to give me a little bit of feedback.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:29.600
Like, some people don't give a shit about that and that's fine.

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:35.560
So like, if you don't care about that kind of relationship, then no big deal.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:40.800
Oftentimes, we are angry at the traditional art world for being so restrictive and gating

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:43.120
and like only certain people get access.

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:50.160
But, you know, I've said this before, like, if you're rewarding people for being a good

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:54.400
customer, you know, at the traditional art gallery, if you're rewarding someone for being

01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:58.240
a thoughtful, meaningful collector that gives you feedback and advice and goes out of their

01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:03.880
way to like, send you royalties, even when the seller didn't want to.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:09.440
Do you think that it would make any sense for me to completely ignore those people and

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:15.200
instead release an artwork that's available for anybody to mint?

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:19.640
It feels like if I was that person that was going out of my way to pay the royalties,

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:25.760
if I was going out of that way, out of my way to give feedback and I was not given an

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:32.120
opportunity to kind of have early access to a piece or at least an early raffle to a piece,

01:32:32.120 --> 01:32:35.120
I would feel a little bit let down and betrayed.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.600
And so I just think people need to be aware of that.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:45.360
Like, I will never release another 10K PFP-type level artwork, you know, and there's a lot

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:50.240
more Squiggle owners than there are potential artworks that I can have in the future.

01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:58.080
And I think it's very reasonable for me to want to reward the people that are trading

01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:05.520
my Squiggles and paying royalties, not punish the people that don't, but reward the people

01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:06.600
that are.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:11.240
And I think that creators have a lot of power here in that sense.

01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.920
And the only time will tell how this all plays up.

01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:19.840
But I really think that this is something that's going to be a pretty impactful part.

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:24.880
It's going to be 30% less now that everything's kind of going to shit on these marketplaces,

01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.800
but it's still going to be part of the narrative.

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:33.120
At least for our blocks, it will continue to be the theme of supporting our artists.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.800
Yeah.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.040
Okay.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:42.960
So moving on to the more practical questions, but still related to the reality, I guess.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:49.200
So I have one student asking, if there are any CC0 work looks projects at the moment.

01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:58.160
I'm asking if someone could make derivatives of Squiggles if they're a non-holder.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.200
So CC0, we do, we have a few.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.360
And I've been very public about my stance on CC0.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.680
I think it's very, something very intriguing.

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:08.000
And I think it's wonderful that the world is exploring it.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:11.600
Obviously, I don't have the guts encouraged to release something CC0, but that doesn't

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:13.680
mean that it's wrong.

01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:18.520
I'd say up there with my favorites, there's a project called Supermental.

01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:27.040
And then I believe, is it, I'll go rhythms, but I'll go beats by Han and Ichael Estaniel

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:28.440
are also released to CC0.

01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:31.960
And I'm sure there's a multitude more out there.

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:36.120
It's a really interesting concept, since this is a university conversation, I'd like to

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.880
get a little bit of to show here.

01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.200
At Art Blocks, we do all these exhibitions.

01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:45.840
And we like to ask A, the artist, of course, their permission to exhibit their work, but

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.840
it'd be we like to ask the collector for their permission to exhibit the work.

01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:52.720
And there's just too many artworks for us not to do that, right?

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.640
Like if someone collector says, I don't want to show it, well, we can always show another

01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.240
person's work.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:07.440
And a very smart artist came back to me one time with the CC0 release and said, well,

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.560
why are you asking collectors for permission to show the work at CC0?

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:12.320
You have this permission, right?

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:14.960
And I thought that was a really interesting point.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:20.280
And I actually very much defend it and understand it.

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:26.560
The idea that CC0 is stripping potentially permission from the artist from displaying

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:29.720
their work, I mean, but then also from the collector, I think it's fascinating.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:33.480
And so I think we still believe it very strongly that with Art Blocks, it's like whether it's

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:36.280
CC0 or not, like somebody is the owner of that artwork.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.920
And we'd love to get permission.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.880
We'd like to get a blessing that that artwork is going to appear.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.480
So it's leading to some really interesting things.

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:47.920
Because if Art Blocks were to ever make prints and we wanted a token gate, prints, obviously

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.600
just the way infinite objects, token gates, Squiggles, would we token gate CC0?

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:54.600
Because why would we?

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:55.600
Right?

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.600
You don't have to own it.

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.840
So anyways, I think it's going to be really fun to explore what CC0 means in the world

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:02.840
of art.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.320
Obviously, in the world of PFPs, it has some really interesting impacts and implications.

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:11.200
And then in the world of art for art itself, I think it's going to be a really fun next

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.840
a couple of years as we explore what all that means.

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:18.800
Regarding the Chromie Squiggle, that's a little bit more complex.

01:36:18.800 --> 01:36:20.640
So there is a license.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:22.440
It's called the NFT license.

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:26.160
And I've been working with an attorney on expanding the NFT license.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.160
And I'm way overdue.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.160
I mean, it's in my backpack.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:31.080
I'm ready to release it.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.760
Just have some tiny little stuff that gets in the way.

01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.720
If you don't own it, no.

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:44.160
The NFT license says that if you own the NFT, you can commercialize the light, the lightliness

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:48.480
of the NFT of the Chromie Squiggle for up to $100,000 a year without asking me any kind

01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.800
of permission.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:54.440
There are things that happen if you exceed $100,000 in revenue a year.

01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.800
So that gets a little bit complex.

01:36:55.800 --> 01:37:01.080
And that's why it's really important to reach out and kind of be in touch with the creator

01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.320
in advance of what you're doing.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:07.520
Because if the project exceeds $100,000, then there are licensing agreements that need

01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:08.600
to come into place.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:13.320
The NFT license that we're releasing is trying to be a little bit more innovative in saying,

01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:19.600
look, if you release a project, you get your $100,000 a year max end of the story.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:24.640
If you reach out to me in advance and clear with me what you're working on, now, to be

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.680
clear, you don't have to clear anything with me.

01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:32.120
You can go make shwarma, Squiggle, whatever you want to do.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:37.000
But if you start exceeding that cap, I can and will, if you're making something that

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:41.800
makes me uncomfortable, like maybe Squiggle underwear or something, say, okay, you are

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:45.560
no longer allowed to continue making this product.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:49.280
With the updated Squiggle license, what I'm doing to try to encourage people to reach

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:54.640
out and give me their ideas of what they're working on so that I can give them in advance

01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:57.600
the yes, even when you exceed the license.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:03.520
We're expanding the value, the revenue to $250,000 a year instead of $100,000 a year

01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.280
for anyone that's willing to reach out in advance and clear what they're working on,

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:13.480
not for the first $250,000 but for what happens after you exceed that.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:17.480
If you don't own a Chromie Squiggle, the only thing that you can really do is if you

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:22.760
have a website and you make something for people that own Chromie Squiggles, then you could

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:28.120
potentially help people that own a Chromie Squiggle make something that they want to

01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:30.080
make.

01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:33.960
That's not super clear in the license and so what we did is say, okay, yeah, you can

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:39.680
do this, but number one, you can't advertise it as Chromie Squiggles by Snowfro.

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:47.080
It cannot help you generate more revenue by utilizing the brand and you have to token

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.080
get it.

01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:50.960
In other words, you have to agree in advance that any products that you make for anybody

01:38:50.960 --> 01:38:55.680
that owns a Chromie Squiggle that they are the rightful owner of that Chromie Squiggle

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:56.680
before you make it.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:58.400
Hello, can you hear me?

01:38:58.400 --> 01:38:59.400
Yes.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.400
Did I lose you?

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:04.400
Hello?

01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:06.400
Uh oh.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.400
Oh, okay, you can hear me.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:20.240
Yeah, I can hear you now.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:21.400
I think we were cut off.

01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:28.320
I lost a few when you were saying what happens if you are a nonholder and what the updated

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:32.200
license clarifies about this situation.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.280
If you're a nonholder, you cannot exploit any specific Chromium Squiggles, but you can

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.240
help other people exploit their own.

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:46.880
In other words, you can have a website that sells merch that allows someone that owns

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:54.120
a Chromie Squiggle to make their own Chromie Squiggle on that merch.

01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.000
There's just some rules on how you can imply that.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.400
But the Squiggle is not CC0.

01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:01.400
It is a licensed item.

01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:06.800
And part of the value proposition I think of the NFT is owning it gives you some permissions

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.800
and some rights.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:13.560
So if you don't own a Chromie Squiggle, ideally you're not out there making merch or doing

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.760
anything specific with luck.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:20.000
And at the very least, if you're doing something with a Chromie Squiggle, because if you go

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.200
make 20 hats, you're not going to hear from me, but you should at the very least get permission

01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:29.320
from the person that owns that Chromie Squiggle, or at least a blessing or a head nod.

01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:32.600
Because really, this, again, a lot of these things are cultural.

01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:35.120
None of these things matter until there's a lawsuit involved.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:40.200
I can't imagine really what it would be like for me to sue someone over making a bunch

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.600
of shirts or a bunch of hats.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:47.280
I mean, we would maybe ask for a takedown if they're doing something that is egregious.

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:49.960
I don't want Squiggles printed on bad quality stuff.

01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:53.120
I don't want crappy merch with them.

01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:57.400
But if you're doing good stuff, if you're making good things, I'm excited to see more

01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.560
Chromie Squiggles out in the world and more power to you.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.560
Super.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:10.640
And that's to be clear, the $250,000 rule that we mentioned, is this an update to the old

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.040
$100,000 limit, or is it just the case of-

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.080
We haven't updated license.

01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:20.520
No, so we haven't updated license and the license is addressing what it looks like for

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:24.560
museums and exhibition centers to acquire the NFT.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.120
Just a little bit of wording in there because that's happening a little bit more and more.

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:36.600
And also, we're trying to give people an incentive to reach out to me and let me know what you're

01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:38.320
doing with your squiggles.

01:41:38.320 --> 01:41:45.720
So you create Chromie Squiggle boxers and all of a sudden, and you sell $100,000 worth of

01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:47.440
boxers, fine, no big deal.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:52.200
All of a sudden, they become like Nike wants to license the Chromie Squiggle.

01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.160
And all of a sudden, it's like a million dollar thing.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:58.160
I probably won't want Chromie Squiggle boxers to exist at that scale.

01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:03.680
And so I would be able to tell you, initially, hey, feel free to operate within the license.

01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.240
But if you exceed that, we're going to put a stop to it.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:10.040
Like, it definitely don't want a global brand of Chromie Squiggle underwear to exist.

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:11.840
And that's kind of what that license is saying.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:16.040
It's kind of like saying, hey, look, as an entrepreneur, what does it take for you to

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.840
make a $100,000 in revenue on a hat?

01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.560
Like, that's a lot of hats.

01:42:20.560 --> 01:42:24.800
And so as an entrepreneur, a lot of us just small scale, we want to just have fun.

01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:25.800
We want to make stuff.

01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:28.280
We want to see what we can do.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.160
And that's what that license is there to do, is to let people tinker and have fun and not

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.320
have to ask questions unless you're getting serious.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:39.200
And if you're getting serious, then we want to know and we want to be involved in the

01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:40.200
process.

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.200
Okay.

01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:47.080
I think we have at least a few artists among our students because I have one, two, three

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:54.400
questions asking more or less, how can an artist be eligible to be included in an art

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:57.000
blocks collection in the future?

01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:00.000
And they put a collection inside that.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.440
Well, number one absolutely has to be generated algorithmically, period.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:10.800
Like, there's nothing we can do at our blogs to host any artwork that already exists.

01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.080
In fact, the magic of art blocks is that the artwork does not exist until it's purchased.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:22.280
So if you're looking at a piece of art, it's already not compatible with that straightforward.

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:25.680
Number two, you need to be able to write an algorithm and that algorithm needs to be written

01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:31.680
in pure JavaScript or a few libraries that are compatible with JavaScript.

01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.440
The majority of projects released in our blocks are pure JavaScript, P5JS or 3JS with a couple

01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:40.440
variants out there.

01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.440
The project needs to be already established and ready to go when you apply.

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:48.800
A lot of people early on would apply with an idea and then be disappointed to know that

01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:50.680
we don't have coders at art blocks.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:55.280
I think it's in fact like a conflict of interest for art blocks to support an artist on how

01:43:55.280 --> 01:43:59.760
to create their code to then be screened and then potentially curated on the platform.

01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:01.640
It just doesn't feel right.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:07.200
And then also a lot of times people reach out asking for help coordinating with the coder

01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:10.800
and that has led to some kind of awkward situations.

01:44:10.800 --> 01:44:12.480
So we really don't do that either.

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.560
Really, when you're applying to art blocks, you need to come with an algorithm ready to

01:44:16.560 --> 01:44:18.200
release on the platform.

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:22.920
And so then it's submitted and there's two layers of screening, screening one, which

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:27.560
accepts about 15% of the artworks that are submitted to art blocks.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.560
1515.

01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:29.560
1515.

01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:36.800
Yeah, it's a reflection of us studying very carefully the market share that we have.

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:44.200
Like the participants in our community compared to the amount of work that was coming in,

01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:45.200
so being submitted.

01:44:45.200 --> 01:44:50.680
At some points we get 200 applications a week and we release six artworks a week at most

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.440
and in fact often less.

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.120
So 15% of them get through and once it gets through, that means it will be released on

01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.480
our blocks and it'll be released on our blocks in one of two categories.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:02.360
It'll either be released in our blocks curated or our box presents.

01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:06.160
So once the artwork gets through and into our box, it goes through a second round and

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:13.520
this is where we actually have a formal, more academic board of curators that decide not

01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.800
which projects are great because we already think the project is great if we're releasing

01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.320
it on our blocks, but which projects are pushing the boundaries, which projects are kind of

01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:27.520
making us even internally rethink the way that we think about generative art or what

01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:30.760
can be done, what's possible with generative art.

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:35.560
And those projects get tagged as curated and released on a slower schedule once every

01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:37.480
other week we release a curated project.

01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:44.720
So at this point, unless the market expands significantly, we're releasing roughly 24

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:49.280
curated projects a year.

01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:52.720
And yeah, that's kind of what we have.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:54.360
We have a new category called explorations.

01:45:54.360 --> 01:46:02.320
It's pretty fun where our blocks is actually getting to explore things that we've been

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:06.560
thinking about for a long time, we just released a friendship bracelet project last week where

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:11.280
these are ideas that I've had for years about what it means to own something, what the difference

01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:17.640
is between a digital and a physical that's connected and potentially has the ability to

01:46:17.640 --> 01:46:22.200
lose value when they're separated versus something that's ephemeral that has an almost intangible

01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:25.200
value to it but is still meaningful.

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:32.160
Things like that, our blocks consumed in the example of the friendship bracelets by itself

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:40.040
our blocks consumed me entirely to the point where I was unable to tinker and really get

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:44.400
behind again, what is this technology, what's the power of this technology.

01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:49.000
And so if I would have had to release that project on my own, which in fact, when I first

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.320
approached Alexi Andre on that project, it was almost six months ago, maybe eight months,

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:58.200
maybe a year ago, I don't know, with the intention of releasing it as I could just separate collaborative

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.680
work between me and Alexi Andre.

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:05.880
It may never have happened but getting the weight of our blocks behind to help tell the

01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:14.560
story and explain what's happening with these physical ephemeral physical objects really

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.560
made things happen.

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.960
So that's the third category called explorations and then of course we have some collaborations

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:23.720
like what we're collaborating with, pace and pace gallery, one of the biggest galleries

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:27.600
in the world, they bring their own artists to the platform and they release artwork there

01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:28.600
as well.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600
Great.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.040
I've got two follow up questions on that.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:39.680
So the first one is if the artwork is not known until it's purchased, how do artists

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:46.400
and the curators board test the output before the artworks are minted, how do you know if

01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.240
the mints are likely to be beautiful as a collection, how do this happen?

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240
That's a good question.

01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.480
So the final edition size is going to be, let's say, an edition of 100.

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:59.160
The final exact edition size is unknown.

01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:04.600
I mean, the final outputs of the final edition sizes are unknown but the algorithm exists

01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.280
and the algorithm can be run.

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.680
So you can press play on the algorithm and see an example output.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:16.400
These example outputs demonstrate the variability of an algorithm and that algorithm could have

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.680
millions, billions of possible outputs.

01:48:20.680 --> 01:48:26.680
What's special about our blocks is that we're forcing the artist to pre-curate the algorithm

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:30.240
to make sure that they stand behind and are excited about anything that could potentially

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:37.160
come out of that mentor and then also to sign off on a very compact final output set.

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:40.920
So if the algorithm can handle millions of outputs, they're setting that as an edition

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:47.200
of 1,000 or 10,000 and then they're locking that and saying the only artworks that represent

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:52.040
this body of work, the final body of work are the ones that were created during the mint

01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:57.480
but you can press refresh on a browser and refresh over and over all the artworks.

01:48:57.480 --> 01:49:02.840
So effectively you simulate the output and you simulate the outputs.

01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:08.400
A related question is, are all art blocks projects minted in the same way with a common

01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:14.000
standard required and how much does it cost usually to go through the whole process?

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:19.840
Well, we are all over the place on how we made the most standard is a Dutch auction.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:25.360
We use a Dutch auction as a method for there to be a little bit of price discovery and

01:49:25.360 --> 01:49:32.440
also to ensure that a strong collector is given the opportunity to collect the work because

01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:37.680
even though it be at a higher price, if they want the artwork, they can get the artwork

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:39.720
before their second gas work.

01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:44.800
It lessens the gas works a little bit, not as much as we'd like.

01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:46.960
Artworks can be released at a fixed price.

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:52.040
We discourage it, especially recently things have heated up a little bit more for art blocks

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:56.640
and so the fixed price auctions are being bought.

01:49:56.640 --> 01:50:01.360
It's really funny to look back now at how strongly the community pushed back on the

01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:07.240
Dutch auction and really wanted us to leave things at fixed price because it made it possible

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:11.680
for the most part for people to be able to flip more.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:17.680
Right now that we're seeing what a sophisticated bot can do, literally consume an entire collection,

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.720
we realize, and that's what we were trying to avoid with the Dutch auction, is that we

01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:24.720
realize that if you don't have price discovery in place and one or two people can completely

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:30.840
ruin your ability as a collector to attain that work or to have the minting experience.

01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:35.000
To me, I still think one of the most important things about art blocks and one of the things

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.480
that will continue to define us, especially as people will explore alternative minting

01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:43.680
methods is that moment of surprise when you mint something and you don't know what you're

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:44.680
going to get.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:49.800
Okay, I've got many, many questions but I'll try to respect your time because I know

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:55.560
you're very busy so I'm trying to pick up a last one.

01:50:55.560 --> 01:50:59.120
We have time for a few more.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:00.840
I mean, I haven't until 9.30.

01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.720
I'll ask two then.

01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:06.360
So the first one is, are you concerned about supply versus demand issues?

01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:11.280
Is there an internal discussion in what looks about market conditions and the supply being

01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.440
issued for its collection?

01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:20.160
Yeah, we are constantly having internal discussions.

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.960
Am I concerned?

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:24.400
No, I mean, this is the thing.

01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:32.440
We often say, like, at our blocks, we are in a river that is moving very quickly through

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:37.560
rapids with no paddles.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:44.800
Supply feels excessive when things slow down and then things pick up and we can't have

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:48.640
anything in stock and then everything else, then all of this, like when there's nothing

01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:53.800
left to mint on our blocks, prices settle higher on the Dutch auction because there's

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.240
nothing to buy anymore.

01:51:55.240 --> 01:52:03.040
And there's no right or wrong there, there's not like a, it's just, it's very difficult

01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:06.200
to control or to manage what that looks like.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:11.560
And so I think it's naive to think that anybody would be able to react quickly enough.

01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:15.960
Yes, art blocks could be a little bit more authoritarian and make decisions on behalf

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:21.240
of the artist, but you have to understand, for example, an artist determines their minting

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:26.080
style for their work, sometimes six to eight weeks before the release.

01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:31.360
So you know, something for.1 ETH today, if ETH were to go to 10,000, all of a sudden

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:36.320
it's like $1,000 for the artwork and we can adjust those things, but you'll see that based

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:42.520
on the transparency of the space, you know, if we have it listed for.1 ETH for five weeks,

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:50.120
and then the week before we make this decision that ETH is just so high that it can't, you

01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:55.400
can't afford that piece, then the artist is in a really bad spot because they lower the

01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:58.600
price and then the community gets upset because we changed the price, etc.

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:06.360
So it, I think that there's an opportunity there to study the market and be as tight

01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:13.440
as we can of the market, but understand also that it's naive to think that we can actually

01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:18.080
control anything in the market.

01:53:18.080 --> 01:53:20.640
This is as much as we can't control the price of Ethereum.

01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:24.480
Just as, I mean, what we can do, what we do have a goal for it, our blocks, let's just

01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:28.440
make this very clear, our goal at our blocks is to increase the number of people that

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.280
enjoy our work.

01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:35.720
And that's not to pump our bags, that's because we believe that we have something that is

01:53:35.720 --> 01:53:42.320
going to be relevant way outside of the 400,000 wallets that currently operate within the NFT

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.320
ecosystem.

01:53:43.320 --> 01:53:49.960
If you understand that and you understand there's 400,000 people that have an NFT or

01:53:49.960 --> 01:53:54.840
that are active in the MTF space and there's 200,000 our blocks of artworks, if that wallet

01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:58.160
count increases dramatically, there may not be enough art for everybody.

01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:01.680
And all of a sudden we're at a deficit and all of a sudden prices start going up.

01:54:01.680 --> 01:54:08.960
We're not doing it for that reason, but we are trying to grow awareness of generative

01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:13.840
art, grow awareness of NFT digital art, scarcity, et cetera.

01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:18.880
And so it's just kind of an interesting balance and we're working through all of it.

01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:20.760
Okay, final question.

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:21.960
I like this very much.

01:54:21.960 --> 01:54:23.720
I could have asked this myself.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.880
So art blocks is a platform, but a lot of people see art blocks as an art brand.

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:31.120
How do you see that?

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:37.120
Is art blocks more like a museum or is it more like a launchpad?

01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:41.600
I don't know that trying to compartmentalize art blocks right now really makes a lot of

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:42.600
sense.

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:49.240
Like for example, art blocks started as an open platform for anybody that can create

01:54:49.240 --> 01:54:53.940
an algorithm to put code on chain and really if you could code a square pixel onto the

01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:58.600
screen and make it change with every mint, like we were happy to have you.

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:00.240
And that has changed dramatically, right?

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:04.960
Like there's just more demand for slots for releases than they are than there is demand

01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:10.520
for art blocks art works.

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.960
What happened when we started screening is if you really think about it, we started

01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.960
following a little bit more of a gallery model.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.840
And that was never the intention of art blocks, right?

01:55:19.840 --> 01:55:24.280
So in fact, you know, we started this exhibition center in Marfa, Texas, which is kind of in

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:27.040
the middle of nowhere, but it's this beautiful place out west actually.

01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:28.320
I'm not to fly out there.

01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.160
And part of the drive of this exhibition center was that there was nothing for sale.

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:35.960
In fact, that's what's kind of cool about art blocks.

01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.240
There's really nothing for sale.

01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:40.440
The only way to buy stuff is to go out on the website and mint stuff or you get something

01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:43.560
on the secondary market, but you would never walk into an art blocks exhibition center

01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:48.720
and be like, see a price tag next to an artwork that's on the wall because there's no need

01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.040
for the exhibition center for that artwork to change hands.

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:56.000
That's what the beauty is of decentralized exchanges.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.600
And I think that there's something really important about being an exhibition center

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.520
and not having something to sell.

01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:06.160
So, you know, the gallery has to sell art.

01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.240
We have to sell art.

01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:11.960
So maybe we are a gallery in that sense, but long term, what I'd like art blocks to be

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:21.640
is like this place where artists become discovered because you know that the next ringer's,

01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:30.200
Fidenza, you know, archetype is sitting out there in the head of a 13 year old that will

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:35.160
learn to maybe even be inspired to learn creative coding and get involved with this because

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:39.480
of the beauty of the things that are coming out of not just our blocks, but like FX hash

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.800
and all the other wonderful generative art platforms that are out there and they're going

01:56:42.800 --> 01:56:43.800
to be inspired by it.

01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:47.400
And that person in three or four years will refine this beautiful algorithm and be released

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:54.600
and blow everybody's minds like, you know, we don't want to have to chase.

01:56:54.600 --> 01:56:59.240
We want to host the best generative art from the best gender artists in the world.

01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:05.760
But we also want to make sure that we create a wonderful home to release the best gender

01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:06.760
of art.

01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:12.400
And so we don't know what the future of our blocks looks like in terms of a category.

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:18.400
We do know that NFTs have been incredibly disruptive, not just from a financial perspective, but

01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.840
from like an understanding of things perspective.

01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:26.520
NFTs have elevated global awareness and appreciation for digital art.

01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:28.640
Forget generative art for just one second.

01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:33.720
Like digital art has been something that creators have been making for years and years and years

01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:35.280
decades.

01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:40.120
And yeah, it's had recognition, but not nearly to the level of like, you know, oil on canvas

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:41.280
and sculpture.

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:46.960
And I think we're seeing this beautiful thing where digital art is having a renaissance.

01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:52.800
Generative art is part of that is like, you know, sharing that moment with digital art

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:54.200
as a whole.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:58:01.240
And we don't know what it looks like when digital art gets to that level of appreciation

01:58:01.240 --> 01:58:04.960
and acceptance as sculpture and oil on canvas.

01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:13.960
But what we do know is that people that own this art are incredibly proud to own the art.

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:17.560
They're incredibly vocal about their ownership of the art.

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.960
In some cases people might be pumping their bags.

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:22.560
In some cases, you see this on Twitter all the time.

01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:30.000
I've seen people transformed from pumping their bags to saying meaningful deep reflection

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:33.800
things that come out of their mind as they look at artwork or as they see this artist's

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:35.080
career expand.

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:37.440
So we're just it's just changing.

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:39.560
Everything's changing so fast.

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:42.960
There's no way to like compartmentalize this right now.

01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:47.560
We just need to do our best to support artists to support collectors to support our team.

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:48.840
You know this is a bear market.

01:58:48.840 --> 01:58:54.760
It's really a weird time and you see people, major companies laying people off left and

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:55.760
right.

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:00.240
You see a lot of crypto organizations faltering and you realize like there's a lot

01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:06.400
of things here that need to happen for art blocks to be an adult company like not just

01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.960
this crypto startup, but like a real company that operates in the real world with real

01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.520
impact.

01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:18.800
And we're we're not going to shoot ourselves in the foot by trying to make any decisions

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:24.280
right now as to what we are as long as we just continue doing everything that we can

01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.200
to host the best narrative art for the best artists in the world.

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:32.600
And yeah, pushing that envelope forward.

01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:36.960
Oh, no, I lost you.

01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:39.040
I can't hear you.

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.040
Sorry.

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:41.040
I wasn't.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:44.840
So I was just saying that this was fascinating.

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:47.640
I really enjoyed your discussion with 6529.

01:59:47.640 --> 01:59:51.920
I really enjoyed this session and I'm sure our students did too.

01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:54.080
So thank you very much for being here.

01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:57.320
Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Snowfro.

01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:58.320
Thank you.

01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.640
Thank you so much for having me.

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:01.840
Thanks for following the course, everybody.

02:00:01.840 --> 02:00:03.800
This is pretty revolutionary in and of itself.

02:00:03.800 --> 02:00:06.240
So congratulations to everyone that's there listening.

02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:07.240
It's cool.

02:00:07.240 --> 02:00:08.240
Thank you.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:11.040
Bye bye.
