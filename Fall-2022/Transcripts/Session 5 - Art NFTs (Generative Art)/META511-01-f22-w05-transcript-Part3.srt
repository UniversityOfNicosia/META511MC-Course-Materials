00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,320
Hello and good evening.

2
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,040
Thank you everyone for joining us for this conversation with three of the leading artists

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,240
in the NFT space about generative art.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
My name is Anika.

5
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
I'm the moderator.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm a writer.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:41,720
Yeah, I started by writing about social media and art and ended up with NFTs.

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,480
And yeah, we have three artists here with us tonight.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
Helena, Matt, I, Xcels.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,640
I, all of you are very familiar with the names, the faces and their work.

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, as just mentioned prior, there are three of the leading artists in this space.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,520
They have created work before NFTs.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,600
They created NFTs during the hype or created generative art before the hype.

14
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,280
They lived through the hype and now they're still here.

15
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,560
So I'm very honored that all three of us are with us tonight.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,440
And the first thing I would like to speak with you about because I sit in a gyro space

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,880
right now, which we open in December.

18
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,400
It's one of the main streets in Berlin.

19
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,080
It's a collaboration with VIRS.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,680
We named a generative abstraction and it's quite interesting because a lot of people

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,520
just walk by and come in and the show is titled generative abstraction.

22
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,040
And in your, I mean, for this talk, it just says generative artists.

23
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,120
And yeah, when people come in here, it's basically people who are not familiar really with NFTs

24
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,000
and what generative art is.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,040
So how do you explain to people who are not part of the NFT space what you actually do?

26
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Who would like to start?

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
I could start.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,040
Okay, Matt, go ahead.

29
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:15,800
Yeah, it's a funny thing to explain because I'll answer this in the context of a couple

30
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,240
of years ago before everything sort of changed a little bit with NFTs and blockchain and

31
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
crypto and everything.

32
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,200
But even then it was very difficult to explain because first you kind of have to explain

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,520
that you're creating art with a computer and then you have to explain you're creating

34
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,240
art with code quite often.

35
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,360
And then people tend to be like, how do you make art with code and then you have to kind

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,240
of explain how you can use code to draw lines or to make shapes or sounds or something.

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,960
And it becomes this like 20 minute long discussion just to get to the basics of it.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,720
So sometimes nowadays I'll quite often just say artist or I'll just say digital artist

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:10,760
or computer artist because generative art is sort of a can of worms for a lot of discussions.

40
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,400
And more recently with crypto and NFT, it's also changed again.

41
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:21,520
It's sometimes depending on who you're chatting with, if they are familiar with NFTs and crypto

42
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,320
and you say you're a generative artist, no matter whether you do or do not engage with

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,120
NFTs, sometimes their first reaction is, oh, all you do is NFTs or is that like what

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,880
you do now?

45
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,240
And there's a whole world of generative art outside of that as well.

46
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:48,280
So it's sort of, it has been a tricky thing to sort of wrap up in a short conversational

47
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,400
small talk sort of way.

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,440
And it's even more complicated now I would say.

49
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,200
But when you do go into this with some people that are not familiar, they quite often they're

50
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,000
really sort of stunned or they're like surprised by it.

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,320
A lot of people, they know what code is and they know what some of these kind of ideas

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,800
are and they can put it together once somebody explains it to them and they can say, well,

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,600
that's kind of cool.

54
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Yeah.

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:19,520
I bet there's more kind of words.

56
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,560
As soon as you mentioned the word NFTs and everyone's like, oh, there's still a thing

57
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I thought they are dead.

58
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Then you have the next 30 minute conversation going.

59
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Thank you.

60
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,080
Who would like to speak next?

61
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,040
Hitzel or Helena?

62
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Yeah, I can add a little bit because I'm sort of on the GSN territory because I was

63
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,400
lumped, well, still lumped with AI art, which is another kind of warm.

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,840
But I consider myself more and more generative artists this day because like Matt said, I

65
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,440
mean, at the end of the day, like people who work with the code who write their own code

66
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,800
who in case of AI make their own data sets or tweak their own models, that basically

67
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,160
makes us kind of like generative slash computational artists.

68
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,480
And that's the category I like to put myself in.

69
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:30,240
I think something interesting has happened with AI in recent months with like mid-journey

70
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,040
and Dolly and stuff is that the definition of like an AI artist that works with AI has

71
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,160
also sort of been shifted in this public perception.

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah, the territory of AI art was claimed by the prompt base AI, but that's not the

73
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,240
kind of like story.

74
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah.

75
00:05:51,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Yeah, my case, I think is tiny bit more complicated when it comes to explaining why the art with

76
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,880
computers, there's nobody does it in my country.

77
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,440
I'm like one of the only ones like I can count five artists that works with computers to

78
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
create art in my country.

79
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:26,360
And this is like a tiny town where only three million people and I've gone to a few talks

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,120
and I think people can get that this is another tool.

81
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:40,720
I've tried my best to simplify the terms and just demonstrate that I can create with

82
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:50,080
emotion and with sticks and stones and generative art or the medium which is social signer in

83
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,720
my case.

84
00:06:51,720 --> 00:07:02,720
It's just another way for me to find a way to express just like others do with dance

85
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,640
and music, which is more predominant and kind of one.

86
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:27,080
I like to say that I like to replicate or simulate what's around me using math and using

87
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:36,240
just in general like geometry or the errors that you can find in code create something

88
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:49,080
different just to say I found to express what is generative art and what I do.

89
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Thank you.

90
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,160
We had the conversation more often that you said in your country that's very few artists

91
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,240
who actually work with code and in the NFT space.

92
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,440
This question goes again to all three of us.

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,320
How did you or when did you know you would like to become an artist or that you are an

94
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:15,560
artist and then how did you get to the part ways that working with code?

95
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:24,200
Well, I started with photography back when I was living in Toronto.

96
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,640
I was there doing different jobs like working in as a dot walker.

97
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,520
I work in a pixel place and in Shisha Varr like so many places.

98
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,000
But I really love just going for a walk and taking photos of buildings or like how the

99
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,920
lights will come through like structures and even from the trees.

100
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:58,800
I think I've always been in love with being fascinated with how light goes into tiny places

101
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
and where you can imagine.

102
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,320
I started looking for programs to study.

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
I went through architectural technology.

104
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,880
I was really interested in urban planning partly because my partner at the time was studying

105
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:27,160
that and I used to sneak in to her classes and being really just about fixing issues that

106
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,960
can help people live in a better way like with landscape design or you know all of this

107
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,800
like subjects that this career includes.

108
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:49,040
That career was really expensive so I changed to I try to find other ways to learn about

109
00:09:49,040 --> 00:10:00,920
computer and design, designing plans and like buildings and I look for programs in this

110
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:09,320
online courses and I found computer science and I just I couldn't stop reading about it

111
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,480
and learning how colors can contain information.

112
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,360
And that information can be used to create other things including the tools that we used

113
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,480
to make art.

114
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
So I was really inspired.

115
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:41,240
I was just really trying to become someone else and being able to come back to my country

116
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,800
with something.

117
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:52,640
So it was a mix of photography, architecture, love and like just practice.

118
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:01,600
I used to read a lot even if I wasn't taking the course because they were still really

119
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,240
expensive.

120
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:13,600
I haven't finished school but I think I taught myself how to do things and how to manage

121
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
them.

122
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:23,120
I think what made me fall in love with it the most was the lack of control I had over what

123
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,680
I was doing.

124
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:34,080
I used to imagine like cities within like all of this patterns that were like at first glance

125
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,840
you think it's like nothing is rubbish but if you look at it with imagination like you

126
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,680
can see tiny nations or cities and were like just something else.

127
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:56,040
So I felt like oh okay so this is like this is my thing like seeing things through abstraction.

128
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,280
So that's part of like how I started.

129
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Thank you for sharing your story.

130
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:10,640
I would like to share the story next with us.

131
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:18,280
I've been a professional software developer for a long time but also more lighted in art

132
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:26,120
and with like computational art I started accidentally in a sense that at work I was

133
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:33,000
doing some stuff with neural networks and then I decided to try it with my own art.

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,320
So I was lucky enough that I had like heaps of digital photographs from my food styling

135
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:50,720
moonlighting so I used them to kind of train networks, neural networks from scratch and

136
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,400
like Excel said I mean it's kind of fascinating when from something like photography you get

137
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:05,360
into something else and actually like I pivoted to the artist's career more than five years

138
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:13,680
ago because I was totally fascinated by the how AI and neural network can elevate your

139
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,080
artistic voice in a sense.

140
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:33,640
I never got it with the analog art to be honest.

141
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,800
Sorry I just wanted to ask one question.

142
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,400
Did you just say you're not good with analog art?

143
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:47,320
No, it's not like I'm good or not good but it's just like too mainstream to average.

144
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:54,000
I wanted, I mean I like to do like unique interesting stuff and like in watercolor you

145
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,400
basically it's like hard to do it.

146
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:04,040
So I mean I hit the artistic book at some point and AI actually helped me to kind of like

147
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,280
break through.

148
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,960
Okay, thank you sorry for interrupting.

149
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:21,240
I just was curious because sometimes if people come by and they don't know about NFTs and

150
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,840
then the question is always like yeah do they have a background in like physical art or

151
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,160
did they start straight away with code because it's so hard for people who are not familiar

152
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,320
with artists using the digital space to imagine that you start out with code.

153
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,320
That's also why I ask you how did you get started as an artist.

154
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,800
Many artists say, many artists say and that's always my first question in interview.

155
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,120
When did you know you are an artist or would you like to become an artist?

156
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,440
Any artist say I love drawing as a kid and that's what I like to do in my life.

157
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,240
I mean I was good at drawing but I was like not thinking I would want to become an artist

158
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,640
so I thought maybe that's different for artists and that's maybe why I'm not an artist because

159
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,560
I didn't think that as a kid but I don't know.

160
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,000
Matt?

161
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,440
I mean when I was a kid I loved drawing but I don't know if I had the sole vision of like

162
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,800
I'm going to be an artist in my life kind of thing but also I think part of that was just

163
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,480
you know you're not really quite often.

164
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,880
It's not always seen as like something that you could do like you know people are like

165
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,600
okay here's the list of possible jobs that you should look into and very rarely is digital

166
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
artists using code ever on there.

167
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,240
So I think one of the things like for me at least here's my sort of little thing is I

168
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:53,280
think it was around 2014 or so that I started to learn about these kind of ideas of generative

169
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,280
art.

170
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:01,200
I think at the time was like really familiar with the whole sort of history of things but

171
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,840
I was just starting to use code for something that was more artistic than what I had done

172
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,720
before and I really like kind of fell in love with that.

173
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:18,680
I just wanted to use the skills I was learning with code and JavaScript and graphics programming

174
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:27,200
and apply those to just making art because before that I had this kind of winding path

175
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:34,600
where in university I studied film and media thinking you know really something to do with

176
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,800
film would be really interesting but it kind of I came to realize it's not really an easy

177
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,000
career.

178
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,440
It's a lot of struggling, it's a lot of just brutal hours and I didn't really want to go

179
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,440
through some of that and at the end of it I felt like a lot of the work I was learning

180
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:03,200
to do in film was not always kind of you know my own and so I like doing these little projects

181
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,800
even at university I was just doing code and I was like doing little games and little graphical

182
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,080
toys and things like that with either Java at the time or sometimes using flash using

183
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:22,120
ActionScript and yeah I guess it wasn't until that point in 2014 after having worked with

184
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,000
code for you know doing web development type thing, web design type things I started to

185
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,560
realize like I could actually use code to just make art and it wasn't really a clear

186
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,720
path at the moment but like I was starting to think about it and then over the course

187
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,280
of several years I just continued to try and move towards that but really it wasn't until

188
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:50,000
probably a few years ago that I started calling myself an artist and saying you know when

189
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,240
people ask me what I'm doing or if I'm going to some event and they're like you have to

190
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,200
put your job title in the badge or something like that it's like that's when I was finally

191
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,640
going to be okay this is what I want to do in life I just want to make art with code and

192
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,720
so I can start to put that on the event badge that says matilary artist and it's funny how

193
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,080
a light switches when you tell people that and when you tell yourself that you just sort

194
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,920
of you fall into it a bit more naturally so that was sort of yeah that was a turning

195
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:30,440
point I don't know the timing but a few years ago and since then I've just been now like

196
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,280
getting more and more like getting you know more and more entrenched into that sort of

197
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:44,200
idea of just making art and thankfully because of the NFT and crypto space it's really become

198
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,960
you know something where we a lot of artists we don't need to as much rely on some of the

199
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:57,040
you know web development web design type work that we were really focused on a lot in the

200
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:04,440
past now a lot of us can just make art and focus on that so yeah it's been an interesting

201
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,080
journey there.

202
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:16,880
And has your approach to making art changed due to NFTs I mean you've just mentioned it

203
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,840
NFTs have been life-changing for many artists because prior many of the artists like who

204
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,880
we know today and are really big in the NFT space and have creative work that's historically

205
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,320
relevant they have prior work is at agencies or have been doing web development or yeah

206
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,760
just had to have a job that helped them pay their rent and now there's NFTs and they're

207
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,920
sold by a marketplaces or platforms and even if it's called an exhibition in most cases

208
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:55,760
you know your work is mostly going to be seen on a website or on a smartphone so has that

209
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
change from what you've done prior creating work and the next step because with bright

210
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:09,400
moments or art blocks or yeah we now see many exhibitions happening so is that a difference

211
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,280
if you know okay you create a work that's mainly going to be seen online to okay I'm

212
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,720
creating work maybe immersive for an exhibition space is that a approach to you?

213
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:27,400
Yeah I think it's changed a lot of things in just the ways that I think we are all sort

214
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:34,480
of thinking about work a little bit so like even something like FX hash and I think a

215
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,520
platform like FX hash has sort of affected the way that a lot of generative artists are approaching

216
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,240
their work there's this sort of you know constant chatter about long-form generative art whereas

217
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,640
most of us were not really chatting about that or thinking about that type of workflow

218
00:20:53,640 --> 00:21:01,200
where you spend months and months and months on a single script and that's your project

219
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,400
like a lot of us would have just been doing more like sketching with code and we would

220
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,720
have just been sort of sketching posting on Twitter posting on Instagram and then doing

221
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,040
a whole new sketch and not really doing anything with our work except you'd be posted and

222
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:22,200
then it just disappears and you know after it gets a few likes the next day it's kind

223
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,200
of gone and you're kind of forced to do more and like bring more content to these feeds

224
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,640
like Twitter or Instagram and that's kind of your you know way that's like what you're

225
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,120
forced to do in this sort of you know pre NFT type of generative artists posting on the

226
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,280
web posting on social media that's how at least I was feeling and I think some others

227
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,400
might have felt similar whereas now there's this kind of different workflow that exists

228
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,840
where we can really work towards a singular sort of vision or a singular idea or concept

229
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,680
or project and we cracked that and we build that out and at the end of it I mean it's

230
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,040
not you know guaranteed that it's going to do well or anything like that but at the

231
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,120
end of it there is something that you can release to the world that is more than just

232
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,480
a Twitter post that you know will get you 20 likes or something it might be an FX hash

233
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,800
post that gets you 20 Tezos but that's I mean 20 Tezos is not much but it's hell of a lot

234
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:32,200
better than just 20 likes and it's the kind of it's a different mindset there is like

235
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:38,560
instead of just posting for the social media for it to be disappeared you're posting on

236
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,920
these blockchains that are kind of permanent in a way and a lot of the work that you know

237
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:51,680
we have minted so far even many months later it's still being it's still very relevant

238
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,840
like it's it's amazing to see how that's changed as well like I don't really see some

239
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:06,600
of the you know pre-2021 generative harp really coming up over and over again in discussions

240
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:11,960
and things except for maybe like the really historical things whereas things that have

241
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:19,240
been minted there's this like kind of constant sharing of them and constant like revival

242
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,240
of them it's there's something to do with maybe the stewardship of them people want

243
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,640
to share what they've you know purchased and things like that whereas you know nobody's

244
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,680
re-sharing my like Twitter post from five years ago so it's just it's an interesting

245
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:43,800
new way of putting out this digital art in the world in a way that you know we were sort

246
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,400
of doing when whenever we would make a print or something like that we would put that that

247
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,640
thing out into the world and we would like give it to somebody and they would hold it

248
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,080
and cherish it and maybe share it with others but you know that's a physical way of distributing

249
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,480
work and now with NFTs we have this more digital or like digitally native way of distributing

250
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,040
work which is just ties a little bit more elegantly than saying oh the only way I can distribute

251
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,520
my work is as print which doesn't really make sense if you're a completely digital artist

252
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,320
it feels weird to force digital artists to work with a physical medium if they don't

253
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,560
want to kind of thing or if they don't feel it suits the work.

254
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:33,240
Thank you one quick thing for attendees you can ask your questions to the artists via

255
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,680
the hashtag on Twitter NFT Q&A or you can ask questions via discourse discourse we're

256
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,720
all happy to answer your questions.

257
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,040
I'll show you back I don't know if you've heard the question I guess you had a website

258
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
issues.

259
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,880
Yeah I just dropped for a second I think you have an idea of like the question but could

260
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,880
you repeat so the question was because Matt prior mentioned that his life has changed

261
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,920
or for many artists through NFTs because prior many of you worked at agencies or web developers

262
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:18,040
and then I was like and has creating work changed for you you first then started creating

263
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:25,520
work to be seen and shared and sold on marketplaces and platforms and now after the pandemic

264
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,080
we see more and more exhibitions happening immersive shows has it also now changed your

265
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,320
way of making art when you approach a project do you do it differently when you know okay

266
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,520
it's going to mainly live online or it's going to be in an exhibition and maybe even going

267
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
to be immersive.

268
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:59,240
I definitely have changed my life completely so where do I begin I think like every day

269
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:07,040
I wake up around 5 a.m. and I think I start I open up my program so once I was using

270
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:15,600
the day before I create something but before we had another motivation like Matt was saying

271
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,040
that before we're just sharing online and we didn't know what to do with all that work

272
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:28,280
and people were reacting to it and that was it but now we are able to create more time

273
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:40,960
and space to be creative by generating enough income to have all the space to experiment

274
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:49,720
to create projects to have the opportunity to be in galleries and now museums and I feel

275
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,920
that that's not only that wasn't my dream before I wasn't dreaming on being in a museum

276
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:01,640
when I started to interact with art it was like that's impossible I wasn't even thinking

277
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,480
about selling it I didn't even create it like print works or anything like that I was just

278
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:17,040
sharing online because I don't know I just wanted to get like an open diary a way to

279
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:25,880
express another language and that has been my way ever since I started with this in

280
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:38,720
2015. I also see it as a this is like a game an online game where a lot of people like

281
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,360
came into the launch of the game and like it was like the first few months of hype but

282
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:56,800
this existed before all of this hype like people were working on programs and on platforms

283
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:10,800
and ways to archive not only art but anything like any data on Shane and I think like the

284
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:21,440
game was on beta and then it switched to like a massive audience and this game has rewards

285
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:29,400
and items and people that love to collect things and put them in their house like if

286
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:34,560
and I think most people that are still in this are people that like games and that like

287
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:44,360
the the way it works like you create a community you walk around the server or the town and

288
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:53,240
you start just like what's what's new in it what's the new update but there's people

289
00:28:53,240 --> 00:29:04,080
that are not in the game obviously those are that are refused to or not acknowledge but

290
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,720
to take the time to understand what happens in this game and there's some others that

291
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:19,800
are front end and they want to keep growing the space or what I would call like the server

292
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:28,000
where we live we're still a really small community in a sense.

293
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:40,080
So I think that's what keeps me not only motivated but it's more open to understanding

294
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:50,160
the dynamics so many things have changed if you notice like there's artists that have

295
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:59,960
more opportunities than others and I'm hopeful that by institutions or like the museums that

296
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,520
are approaching us or universities creating this venue is where we can talk about this

297
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:16,320
as a similar class it will attract more people into it and it will become more natural not

298
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:25,360
just an exclusive game where only a few have access to it.

299
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:37,760
That's the way like it had changed my family's life to like in real life I was just depending

300
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,480
on my mom and my brother for a long time because my mind could only focus on art and

301
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
I wasn't doing anything else.

302
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,960
I did work for a long time in tech support and you know so were hardware issues but I

303
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,460
never used a computer to create art and when I started doing it I couldn't stop and I

304
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:06,960
thanks to my family I was able to have the time to do this so yeah NFTs and the opportunities

305
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,680
that it opened up changed everything for me I always say it I'm always trying to like

306
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:21,320
come back and show gratitude because I didn't do it alone I wouldn't be here if it wasn't

307
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:34,680
for other people that are really interested in this and that wants to keep it going.

308
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:40,440
Thank you that's great to hear that NFTs really helped support you and your family

309
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,240
and yeah I think that's actually the best that could happen and I find it really interesting

310
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,880
that you said well you didn't even think about being in a museum and now institutions

311
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,080
approach you and I think that's very beautiful.

312
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,480
Helena how about you?

313
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:07,280
It's in terms of how NFT kind of changed my life I think like from the artistic perspective

314
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:15,200
it's mostly because I could stop being bucketed in the straight eye artist bucket I became

315
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,560
more kind of like digital artist and what it started very fruitful period in my art

316
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:31,240
making which I call post again is more post the I.R. where I kind of like could mix various

317
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:38,560
kind of like styles and things and people kind of responded to it and nobody kind of

318
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,600
required when I see the quite over 10 FTS nobody required for me making straight the

319
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,280
eye art so it kind of gave me like freedom and to kind of break through and to new angles

320
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:59,600
in my creativity so because from the money perspective to be honest I would have made

321
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:07,000
more money being a software consulting can be continuing to do this stuff so but yeah

322
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,520
I mean like Kickshail said when you start to making art you basically it's very hard

323
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:19,160
to switch back and forth I did it but but it's like for a long time but it's really

324
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:28,200
kind of hard to do but these days you basically kind of think about stuff is like stuff you

325
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,240
making new projects pretty much all the time and it helps when you have like several streams

326
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,000
because I'm not only like an artist I do a lot of like physical work like books and

327
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
stuff and I think it's very helpful like for artists not to be sort of like straight

328
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:56,080
and if it is all because I mean I think at least like in my case you need to have few

329
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,640
projects because maybe you failed in one but you will succeed in another one like selling

330
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:09,920
the books or making the books so it keeps you busy and keeps your creativity diversified

331
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:17,040
in a sense so because yeah I think like again I mean people can call themselves so whatever

332
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:23,800
but calling yourself and then the tea artist I think it's kind of limiting being an artist

333
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:31,160
and like make art try different things like stick with certain stuff but yeah I mean it

334
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:37,880
really kind of helpful to think this way and as you've just mentioned you work with AI

335
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:43,280
and I think over the past let's say six months we have seen a lot happening when it comes

336
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:51,480
to AI and artists or even non-artists using AI do you feel threatened by new technology

337
00:34:51,480 --> 00:35:00,920
no I mean new technology kind of like I am using this technology and in a sense I think

338
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:09,880
like being a devil's advocate or kind of like contrarian I feel kind of like working with

339
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,720
GANS it's almost like working with obsolete technology and I welcome it because the at

340
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:27,000
the end of the day you need to do whatever kind of like makes you happy which makes interesting

341
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,400
things I mean technology is just like the tool I mean people you can use prompt based

342
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,160
AI you can use GANS you can use whatever like deep dream I mean as long as you kind of

343
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:47,000
create stuff that satisfies you and satisfies your audience that's what it is and artists

344
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,440
is basically a very kind of like loose definition if you call yourself the artist you're the

345
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
artist.

346
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:07,320
I mean what I'm oh sorry no go ahead I just wanted you know at the beginning of like

347
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:26,200
the wave of generative art that's saying I think it was 10,000,000,000,000 till 20,000

348
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,480
exploded but I think at the beginning people were doing a lot of perling noise circles

349
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:37,400
like it was just you can tell like they were just using repurposing someone else's like

350
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:44,280
projects and I think it's the same with AI like at the beginning you see a lot of like

351
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,480
really beautiful art but if you still if you see the same over and over again you can start

352
00:36:51,480 --> 00:37:04,680
like realizing that like what's actually something that's out of the box that's different that

353
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,080
comes from an artist's mind you start curating that so I don't think we should be afraid

354
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:20,800
of like all this wave of new artists that use AI to create art like just like have to find

355
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:28,360
artists like Helena like create things that are really unique and comes from a very personal

356
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:35,200
place and like math and like many others so it's just about curation we're always going

357
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,560
to need curation no matter what comes new.

358
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:50,320
I mean also especially the three of you you all have found your voice and a signature

359
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,120
style might be the wrong word but I mean looking at your work it's quite clear it's coming

360
00:37:55,120 --> 00:38:03,240
from you and I just got questions from the audience and one of the questions I always

361
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,720
also ask myself because I find it generous out I find really interesting I find it fascinating

362
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,520
like what Leander Hadswig and Richard Nadler have done for example with the Richter piece

363
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:20,320
you know that it's live running and I think yeah many people who started start collecting

364
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,040
or many younger artists who work with I don't know traditional medium think about well what

365
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:34,880
is a good way if you would like to start work with code or become generative artist and

366
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,400
I asked other artists to question myself well would I have a chance to learn coding these

367
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,280
day and someone like Travis Smalley the artist was doing the pixer rock set it took him like

368
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,960
five years and he basically taught himself how to code and some artists say to me it's

369
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,160
totally impossible don't even try it so what's your answer if someone says well how could

370
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,800
I get started even if I'm just interested in learning how to code and don't have the

371
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,840
goal of becoming an artist.

372
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:13,800
You might get easier soon with all the chat GPT and AI tools like GitHub co-pilot and

373
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:22,240
things I think as those things continue to develop it will become easier and easier to

374
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,800
use code for creating things and at a certain point it will maybe change where you know

375
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,160
the next wave of generative artists won't be really writing code by hand so much maybe

376
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:47,680
not maybe I don't know but maybe they'll be you know pulling on these AI systems to basically

377
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,160
help them synthesize maybe synthesize images but maybe also synthesize programs or some

378
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:03,360
sort of state machines or systems that then are used to drive some kind of our work but

379
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:10,360
I guess yeah to answer the question very simple other than using AI systems and hoping they

380
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:17,400
all continue to improve another way is just to do really simple things and I think simple

381
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,280
things are kind of under appreciated because there's this kind of constant drive to focus

382
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,200
on just the visual aesthetic and visual complexity and detail and things like that but I mean

383
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,680
simple things are kind of beautiful as well like Elsworth Kelly type shapes or of course

384
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,920
you know I'm always referencing solo it because the work is very simple and it's actually

385
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,960
something that is quite good for people that are kind of new to this to learn because

386
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,600
it's not like okay you need to implement like a crazy cellular autonomous type thing it's

387
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:01,000
something simpler and I know it's like the classic everyone talks about solo it type

388
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:09,080
thing but it is you know when you're using something as simple as a line or okay I have

389
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:14,600
a rectangle to draw because I don't want to spend five years learning how to code these

390
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:23,000
complex structures you know that's a source of inspiration so that's just my approach

391
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:30,520
to getting people interested in this and getting people to begin with this but I also recognize

392
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,880
that there's more than just solo it and then I know that's like a maybe contentious topic

393
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:47,440
because it's such an overused reference in this space but yeah yeah and then if kind

394
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,440
of like this a graphical geometrical stuff doesn't fascinate you or them maybe there

395
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,600
is no reason to learn I mean it's like I think it's a certain class of people who gets attracted

396
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:07,520
to generative art and like for me for example I came to know like processing and the cases

397
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:16,680
work back in 2010 but it didn't stick I mean I tried I could do stuff but because I was

398
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:21,800
a like professional social development it didn't work for me so that's why I kind of

399
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,080
like who found my game in the eye which is another kind of like mathematical approach

400
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:33,880
to art making or engineering so again find what you are for me and it's like there is

401
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:40,960
no kind of requirement to do the generative art right if you go to the agency yeah just

402
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,000
to follow up on that I mean there's others that are you know they like you're saying

403
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,800
they're not into the geometric and maybe they're not also into the AI and so they end

404
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,840
up going down a different path of like doing something analog but maybe leaving some sort

405
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:02,440
of generative system into it whether it's a computational or not or maybe they're doing

406
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,520
something you know with physical computing or with installation I think it's all sort

407
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:14,600
of it's very all tied together and you might end up finding that you prefer one of these

408
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:21,560
things over the other rather than just doing the sort of you know visual I don't know what

409
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,480
have we defined these things but like the visual geometric abstraction type generative

410
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:34,440
art as opposed to other areas that could also be described as generative art or computational

411
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,080
art algorithmic art or whatever.

412
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:49,960
Yeah for example I always wanted to create a game but and like something more complicated

413
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:58,680
than it's a team and imagine that in a few years we can or less than that we can create

414
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,840
like games on our own without the need of having like different kind of developers or

415
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,080
a big team or a big company to do so.

416
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,400
So those are the dreams.

417
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:20,840
I think with technology like this we can we can dream more like instead of being negative

418
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:28,080
negative about it we can think of way how to use it for good not just to you know just

419
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,960
to make quick money or copy others or being cool but there's so much more you can do

420
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:45,760
with it like research and like other fields will like exponentially get faster like instead

421
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:53,520
of years of like studying into like let's say a molecule like it will take less than

422
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,240
that and like there's so much so many uses for a side of art.

423
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,720
So yeah I'm pro. What is what would you say as an artist when you look at generative projects

424
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:12,400
of yourself and of other artists but it's what is a good project for you an interesting

425
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,080
project for you from yourself you continue working on and then actually publish and yeah

426
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,960
I guess that's the question.

427
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:26,080
What is good generative art after you when it comes to your own art and then to what

428
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:34,080
you collect or like our inspired by.

429
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,560
I guess that's a tricky one right.

430
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:44,760
There's I mean there's so many things where you see something and you just there's just

431
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,600
some some attachment to it and it's very personal and you can't always explain why you like

432
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:58,160
something and then there's other things where you might realize sort of that there's a lot

433
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:06,320
of work that's gone into something but it might not speak to you and it's I think it's

434
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:13,520
one of these tricky questions where it's like I don't know if I or anyone else is in

435
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:18,920
a position to be like that is not art or that is good art or that is bad art or or whatever

436
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:28,320
because I think it's just this it doesn't really seem to be a very effective thing and

437
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:35,360
I know that people become art critics and they some some art critics will just spend

438
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:44,560
a lot of their time focused on that question but it I don't know it's hard to say what's

439
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:51,600
good maybe attending exhibitions is a good way and also kind of like looking maybe for

440
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:57,440
clubs because I think like when two artists come together there is always something I

441
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,080
mean almost certain something interesting comes up like exactly Berman and this creville

442
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:10,600
each cover or myself with me three not to kind of like with myself on the shoulders

443
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:16,360
as so I think I like collapse like especially for independent artists is like really interesting

444
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,800
projects to look at.

445
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,160
So I think I missed your question.

446
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,080
I'll ask it again.

447
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,280
My question was what is good generative art for you?

448
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:34,640
How do you know what are criteria quality criteria when you look at other artists work

449
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,360
and when you look at your own work when do you know well this is a project you continue

450
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,400
working on yeah what is good for you what is interesting for you?

451
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Oh the next one issues again.

452
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:56,200
Well we wait I could actually expand on that and I can just duck out when she's back but

453
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:04,080
for me I mean it's changed a lot in the last five years maybe I'll just I'll let okay

454
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,720
she's going in the notes so I'll just answer.

455
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,360
But for me it's changed a lot in the last five years because originally when I was learning

456
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:20,080
about generative art and and getting familiar with some of the sort of make ways of upcoming

457
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:27,320
things in generative art I was really looking up to sometimes like the very technical stuff

458
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:34,000
and I was like wow that's incredibly complex and like the way that this has been coded

459
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:41,320
is incredibly complex and I think nowadays I'm sort of more looking up to like the conceptual

460
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:49,960
stuff or the things that you know bring in outside maybe analog or bring in you know

461
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,440
sort of story or bring in these these things outside of just the complexity of code or

462
00:48:54,440 --> 00:49:00,240
or the way that the sort of project was visually assembled and things like that so I don't

463
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,880
know that's just one comment.

464
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,880
Thank you.

465
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:19,480
I trust that having heard the question or was that a her cut off right or not?

466
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:26,160
Well I think people know that I was creating art online for a long time like in different

467
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,200
pages and my own page.

468
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:38,280
I just haven't a specific, not a specific but I just know what I like and I get obsessed

469
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,280
with it.

470
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,760
Like Matt says like sometimes when you are so obsessed or so into your own art you don't

471
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:55,920
really look into judging others like it just let it exist because like there's you know

472
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,680
different kind of trees out there.

473
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:09,240
So it's but when it comes to curating I think a theory of colors is very important like

474
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:15,040
the way you combine certain things, palettes, there's many generative artists that have

475
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:25,880
created like resources like palettes, color palettes for others to use and sometimes that's

476
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:33,400
you can see it around a lot like the same tones and colors and many many works but there's

477
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:40,680
art is that finds a way to create it like use it in a different way even if it's the

478
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:44,040
same palette that someone else shared.

479
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:50,720
I think that's been the center of generative art for a long time too like we all share

480
00:50:50,720 --> 00:51:01,880
techniques and ways to do certain things and sometimes we find each other doing similar

481
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:08,520
works because it's all comes from algorithm and that just exists.

482
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:11,400
It's not something that someone invented.

483
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:22,000
So someone did discover and well math has its way to exist in like different forms in

484
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,880
nature and then in what we create.

485
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:36,240
So I think finding something that is different is the difficult part of all this like just

486
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:54,920
being able to trace back to everything you've seen before and understand.

487
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,520
We lost Ixrels again.

488
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:08,520
Yeah, I think we all agree that 16 minutes is how long we would like.

489
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,800
Oh, she's back.

490
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,440
We hear you again and see you again for it.

491
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:16,800
Oh, no.

492
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,800
Connection issues.

493
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, so my last question would be because we said 16 minutes.

494
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,880
There's also questions from the audience.

495
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,200
The future of generative art and AI art.

496
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,240
I mean right now as all three of you also mentioned, we see a lot of sales but it seems

497
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,440
like a smaller community.

498
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,440
I think it feels like we all know each other.

499
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:51,280
Just maybe from Twitter or Discord or many of us have met at this point in time I think.

500
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,760
Yeah, and how do you see the future of the space and of generative art?

501
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,360
I mean we've seen the topic and I'm about at MoMA right now.

502
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:59,080
Oh, there she is.

503
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Back again.

504
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,080
Hi.

505
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:02,880
Another try and then our last question.

506
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,280
I don't know if it's the internet or a server.

507
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:11,200
A string yard.

508
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,040
But yeah, where was I?

509
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:29,160
I think as I was saying, you'll have this certain unique taste for art.

510
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:38,360
For example, being at like really light colors, recently warm colors.

511
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:42,000
Before I was very into black and white only.

512
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,560
But at the same time I will create the same piece in different colors.

513
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,440
But I wouldn't show it.

514
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:59,520
Because I had this pattern of following same tones when I create a grid on my gallery,

515
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:04,200
which has been my Instagram page for a long time.

516
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:10,360
But yeah, it's just a matter of taste to discern and to turn out the art.

517
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:19,720
The other day I saw this meme about how perfect and adult art was like a lava lamp.

518
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:31,320
I just don't understand how you can reduce someone's creativity to just being part of

519
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,920
a room or entertainment.

520
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,480
There's so much more to it and so much work that goes behind.

521
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,520
But it's just the same with the internet.

522
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:48,280
You can find a lot of meaning in patterns that other people don't see or don't know

523
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:53,840
how to use them to say something.

524
00:54:53,840 --> 00:55:03,480
I use the wave of the ocean, even photography or video or kinetic lines to express a lot.

525
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:14,040
So yeah, I think the way to generate the art is for the curator to actually fall in love

526
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:22,560
with what they're looking at and not just use as another object or another art to fill

527
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:28,600
up a gallery or whatever tasks they need to do.

528
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:34,760
For me, when you do everything with love, you can create a lot of magic.

529
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,560
When you don't do it, then you realize, oh, I was like automatic.

530
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,000
I was just acting like a robot.

531
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,960
Which surprisingly is something I try not to do.

532
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:54,880
I try to deep program myself all the time, one way or the other.

533
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,080
We lost our grandmother, I think her son is close to finish.

534
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,400
Great job.

535
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,720
Would you like to add something?

536
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Oh, no.

537
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,240
She's saying she's just like an end of sentence.

538
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,240
Yeah.

539
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:13,160
I mean, she comes back for answering the last question because she also just mentioned

540
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,600
graphic anadol and yeah.

541
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:19,400
I mean, I think it's excellent for the piece base and for everyone of us to see graphic

542
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,200
anadol and normal.

543
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,960
And yeah, one of the attendees asked the question, where do we see the future of generative

544
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:33,520
art and I've just said prior, all of you also mentioned it sort of like it feels like

545
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,240
a small space because we somehow all know each other.

546
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,360
We have met in person or we know each other through Twitter or Discord.

547
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,080
So what's your prediction for the future?

548
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:44,400
Now, graphic anadol at MoMA.

549
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,440
I know that it's less speaking with a lot of institutions.

550
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,960
A lot of institutions have approached her.

551
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:58,160
And institution and then just collected the two NFTs from Leander Hatzog and Richard Nautla.

552
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,000
Gerhard and Richard are now in a museum collection.

553
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,840
So we see more and more NFTs going in.

554
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,520
Yeah, what's your prediction for the future?

555
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:16,920
Or what needs to happen that we see the future you hope for this space?

556
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,920
I could start, I guess.

557
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,960
I think there's sort of two questions and two answers here.

558
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
One of them is like, what's the future of NFTs?

559
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,920
And one of them is like, what's the future of generative art?

560
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,720
And I think they'll be both intertwined and linked in different ways.

561
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,960
But they'll also have different futures.

562
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:44,080
So the future, I think, of generative art is just sort of the continuation of it, except

563
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:49,520
expanding since like, you know, whatever the 60s or whenever we can say that it started

564
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,240
and just continuing to grow and expand in the public consciousness and hopefully grow

565
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:01,000
and expand in sort of the collections of the world in a way so that now we're starting

566
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:11,040
to see those artists be sort of acquired and be highlighted and be displayed.

567
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:18,480
But it's now beginning to happen over the course of the last couple of decades or something

568
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:19,720
like that.

569
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,760
And it will probably just continue to grow and there will be more and more interest in

570
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,160
maybe in 20 years.

571
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:32,920
It will be very common that a museum is going to be filled with digital art, which even

572
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,080
now it's still not exactly common.

573
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:43,480
You go to most of the world class museums or galleries and they're still not primarily

574
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:49,480
digital art, even though, you know, I think in as time goes on, we're living these sort

575
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:58,240
of very digital lives and we do have a lot of digital outputs and sometimes the ratio

576
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:04,320
of things don't really in current galleries don't really reflect the reality.

577
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:07,360
So that's one thing is just that it's going to continue to expand and grow and there'll

578
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,280
be different takes on a different ways of exploring that.

579
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:19,120
But then also I think with NFTs specifically, I think it will continue to like shift very,

580
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,120
very drastically.

581
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:24,960
I think the NFTs that we're seeing right now are like one type.

582
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,760
So like the reffic anodele in MoMA.

583
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:35,160
I think we will probably also continue to see museums and galleries, I mean, not that they

584
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:42,200
haven't already, but they will continue to have this focus on using the blockchain and

585
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:48,240
using these systems as like artistic mediums.

586
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:56,160
So I mean, the work of Ray and Myers or Deathbeef, I think those kind of artists will, you know,

587
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:02,960
be highlighted more and there will be more and more interest in building systems that

588
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:11,200
are using these kind of tools and using these kind of technologies.

589
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,400
Whereas sometimes there's a lot, there has been a lot of like mainstream focus and I

590
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:23,280
would count MoMA sort of as this mainstream sort of focus as well as like the NFT as an

591
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:28,800
image for the NFT as like a, as a gift for NFT animation or something.

592
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:32,800
But I don't think that's really the realistic future of NFTs.

593
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:35,520
I think they will be expanded to much more.

594
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,560
And I think it'll be pretty common that a lot of artists that work with digital and even

595
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:45,400
a lot of artists that work with physical will be distributing their work through these mechanisms,

596
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,160
even if they don't, you know, explicitly call them NFTs.

597
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:54,680
So just say I'm releasing some work and it's an auction, like right now I couldn't imagine

598
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:57,520
setting up my own auction with fiat.

599
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:02,000
I think it would be a disastrous nightmare where I was setting up an auction with crypto

600
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,120
is actually kind of makes sense.

601
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:08,920
Like you can have a Dutch auction with crypto and thousands of millions of people can participate

602
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:14,080
in it and you don't need to go to a single place like Christie's.

603
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:18,840
You can, you know, build these systems without going to Christie's or without going to Saudi

604
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,840
ways.

605
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,720
And you can direct how much percentage you want from the auction.

606
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,440
You don't need to subscribe to a 50% cut or something like that.

607
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:32,960
So I think it will just continue to grow and expand basically.

608
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:44,200
Helena, it's largest asked for your future prediction.

609
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,160
I think you're like in sync with Matt with what Matt said.

610
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:53,480
And honestly, I don't care much about being in museum or not being in museum.

611
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,520
I mean, I enjoy like the NFT gave artists the freedom to sell their stuff, to be shown

612
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,880
without kind of like institutions.

613
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:06,800
I haven't been to sort of this or anything, but kind of like, I don't feel miserable

614
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,800
because of this.

615
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:13,360
I mean, I kind of like create my own story.

616
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,600
So that's NFT again.

617
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,480
It's like about freedom and that's what I kind of like about it.

618
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,960
And I hope it continues like this.

619
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:33,040
I mean, we have enough kind of like tooling and infrastructure to make it happen with

620
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:36,680
independent collectors, with independent artists.

621
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:38,120
And that's the beauty of it.

622
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:42,840
I don't want to be in centralized honestly.

623
01:02:42,840 --> 01:03:00,320
You know, from my perspective, I think it's an honor to be recognized by entities that

624
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:08,360
have been around for a long, long time and have managed to stay relevant.

625
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:22,360
We lost I excels again.

626
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:28,360
You're back.

627
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,360
Beautiful.

628
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:36,920
So before I'm misunderstood, what I'm trying to say is that NFT is definitely or like blockchain

629
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,600
art is a revolution.

630
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,840
It's a way for us to create our own museums.

631
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:51,520
Like we are actually moving up to long ago about how it was called like, but also Tranquilidad

632
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:58,040
Agasso program sale, which means for your tranquility, do your own museum.

633
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:05,920
For some people, being a museum is not about just the recognition that it's about preserving.

634
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,760
I will literally just disappear if my art disappears.

635
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,360
I don't think I could stand that.

636
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:27,200
And if we keep it in an unstable place, like it's a web browser or Instagram, like it certainly

637
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,920
carries that risk.

638
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:36,960
I think one of my biggest goals is to preserve myself through time regardless if I'm here

639
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,040
or not.

640
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:48,560
So that's one of the reasons why I enjoy or I respect the fact that museums are paying

641
01:04:48,560 --> 01:05:02,360
attention to this.

642
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,360
We lost her again.

643
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,880
That's what a few seconds and then, no, she's back.

644
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,880
She's always coming back.

645
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,480
That's the good thing we know by now.

646
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,480
It's very reliable.

647
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,760
I shall be coming back.

648
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,480
Or maybe not this time around.

649
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,200
I mean, the good thing is you all know where to find us on Twitter and on Discord.

650
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:33,120

651

653
