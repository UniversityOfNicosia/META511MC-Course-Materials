1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,720


2
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,560


3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,960


4
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:44,600

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,960

6
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,160
This is session eight of the course.

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:02,120
We're going to talk about what is the metaverse, what is a metaverse, what are metaverses,

8
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:07,400
and I can give you the exciting conclusion from now we're not going to know the answer.

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,120
I don't know the answer, I don't think anyone else knows the answer.

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,960
So what we are going to do today is, I think ask the questions more than conclude on the

11
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
answers.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
I also want to say something about scheduling which George and I agreed on earlier today,

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,160
but we need to announce it online.

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:34,960
We have a lot of guests and it's been hard to get the sessions out and get all the guests

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,880
here so we're going to extend the course and particularly the time for the guests into

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,880
January.

17
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,240
We'll do the sessions on time and we'll do the guest, some of them now and some of them

18
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,200
in January so we can fit everyone in because it's just to get everyone's schedules

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,840
coordinated but we will go through as planned.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,160
And so as with other sessions, this is a session where we will get some concepts in

21
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:12,640
place and we are then going to talk about then we're going to talk about some of these topics

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,440
with some of the guests.

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:28,680
So let me, I only have two titles for this session, Metaverse frameworks and Metaverses

24
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,600
with a question mark and we'll talk about what these might be.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:45,840
So, it's clear that there is now much more interest in Metaverse than there has been

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
historically.

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,400
This is the Google Trends data from 2004 and basically it's a flat line on the floor

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,320
until basically last year.

29
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:06,640
And some interest picked up, then Facebook announced changing their name, etc.

30
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:17,400
interest shot up and has now pulled off a little bit, but at hugely higher levels than

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
we were before.

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:28,760
And so I think it is fair to say that it is a topic that has now attracted a lot of interest.

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
It is a topic that has attracted interest from civilians.

34
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,480
I mean, it's interesting because I think some of us, you know, people with a more sci-fi

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,960
type orientation have considered the Metaverse to be kind of an obvious thing for forever.

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,040
I mean, decades.

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,160
But you can see from the Google Search data that this has absolutely not been the case

38
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
in general.

39
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:08,080
You know, civilian interest in the Metaverse is maybe 12 to 18 months old.

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,560
It's a great,

41
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:25,160
so we're going to have a Metaverse and the interesting thing is, I think as many people

42
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:31,960
as have written or spoken about the Metaverse as many people have written as one of those,

43
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
that's how many definitions are the Metaverse

44
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:38,400
and it's very interesting because I mean, I don't think any of them are right, but also

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,960
I don't think any of them are wrong.

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,000
And I want to go through these aren't you going to read these

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,040
because I think these are very interesting because they give you a sense of the different

48
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,040
ways people are thinking about.

49
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Some people are just hugely aspirational, very non-specific,

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,360
it's not a big shock that McKinsey's in that bucket.

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,360
But you know, the Metaverse seems to be whatever people's imaginations dream it to

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
be. The verge,

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,480
it's partially a dream for the future of the Internet.

54
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,200
JPMorgan, the seamless conversion of our physical and digital lives

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,880
and I mean, I think all of these are true, but they don't really give you much to, you

56
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,440
know, hang your hat on.

57
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,200
Then there's folks who get much more specific

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,560
so we'll see you on that bit.

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,600
In a time 3D social medium where people can create and engage in shared experiences as

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,280
equal participants in an economy of societal impact.

61
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,960
Matthew Ball, who has written a lot about the Metaverse, a massively scaled and interoperable

62
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,040
network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds, which can be experienced synchronously and

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:05,800
persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,640
and with continuity of data.

65
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:18,280
I think a definition like this is actually what most people, most civilians think of

66
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,280
here.

67
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:28,120
I think most civilians, when you tell the Metaverse, they're like, it's a 3D world and I probably

68
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,560
have to put VR goggles and I'm not sure how interesting this is

69
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
and anyway, it's not something I want to do

70
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,680
and a lot of people are like that.

71
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,560
And then there's these, I'd say more conceptual definitions where I'd put these conceptual

72
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,760
definitions of like the Metaverse is already kind of here.

73
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,200
You know, the Metaverse is not 3D or 2D or even necessarily graphical,

74
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,840
It's about the inexorable dematerialization of physical space, distance and objects, John

75
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Radoffin.

76
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I like this one, to be honest.

77
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,760
This is probably closer to my view,

78
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,720
we'll come to that in a moment.

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,080
And then, Sean Purney, "The Metaverse is the moment in time where our digital life is worth

80
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,720
more than our physical life."

81
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:30,520
I have to admit, if I was an outsider and I read all these things, it sounds like a word

82
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,240
salad, to be honest.

83
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,520
It doesn't sound very practical, it doesn't sound very real, it doesn't sound very here.

84
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,360
We'll see how we think about this in a few more slides.

85
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:52,000
Now in this section, I'm going to present three different Metaverse frameworks, how

86
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
do I figure out a Metaverse?

87
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,600
Two of which I stole from UNIC and one of which is my own.

88
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,200
And so I'll do the UNIC ones that honor first and then I'll share mine.

89
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,440
As usual, I don't think any of them are right and I don't think any of them are wrong.

90
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,880
So, the Unichroto reported about the Metaverse for the European Union Blockchain Observatory

91
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:24,720
and formed, and the team came up with a three-part framework.

92
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,200
The first part is that it has universal impact.

93
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,400
That a Metaverse, like other broadly adopted technologies and the internet, mobile phones

94
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,440
and what have you, are universal in nature.

95
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,000
They go across norms, disciplines, cultures, barriers.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Some things you might think about is that some more specialized games, Metaverse, et cetera,

97
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,640
might fail this first test of universality.

98
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,800
The second test is persistence.

99
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,320
I actually think this is important.

100
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,680
So, here there's a you know, a cohesive and shared experience is created in your world.

101
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:20,800
I think the mental model here is you leave and you come back and it's still there.

102
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
It's not a firm rule.

103
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:33,800
And the fire is adaptability, here defined as users can immerse themselves in a limited

104
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,800
or significant way according to their individual needs.

105
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,280
It's a reasonable framework to be honest.

106
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,920
It's simple, it's straightforward, it's fairly conceptual.

107
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Let's put it as one mental model.

108
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Then we have a second framework that I call the "Giaglis Framework",

109
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,360
George came up with it,

110
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
he doesn't actually call it the Giaglis Framework.

111
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,600
So, he's probably going to yell at me that I called it that in the presentation,

112
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:14,760
but since he's the one who told it to me, I have put his name on it.

113
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:23,080
And here is has six characteristics across two dimensions.

114
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:28,920
And the dimensions one is technological in nature, one is governance in nature,

115
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,640
and I think this is really interesting too.

116
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:35,040
This is kind of more specific and more future looking, I think.

117
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,880
And here the technology properties are photorealism, immersive as in persistence and what I call

118
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,160
is the governance property, data ownership, openness and censorship resistance.

119
00:10:49,160 --> 00:11:05,160
And his view of this is not that more photorealism is good and less photorealism is bad or more

120
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:17,920
photorealism is more Metaverse and less photorealism is less Metaverse and this applies for all of these variables or all these parameters,

121
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,720
it's just a way to classify them.

122
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,360
It's a way to say this Metaverse is photorealistic,

123
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,840
this Metaverse is

124
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,840
not photorealistic.

125
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:35,960
And so, you start thinking about these as sliders or spectrums.

126
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,400
So one spectrum is a photorealism,

127
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:45,640
are we trying to replicate the visual model of the real world?

128
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:52,680
Or as many games or social media or other possible universes don't look like the real

129
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,000
world, at all?

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,040
The second is immersiveness.

131
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:08,440
How much are you in this world versus not in?

132
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
What's the degree?

133
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,360
You know, email is partially immersive.

134
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
I sit at my laptop,

135
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I do things,

136
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:24,320
I have my email client open, I go in and out,

137
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
it pings me,

138
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,320
This harasses a little bit.

139
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,320


140
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,320
I'm never totally out,

141
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm never totally in.

142
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,440
If you're playing some first person shooter VR game with VR goggles, I'm only pretty

143
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,440
immersed.

144
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
You're not.

145
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,000
You're not also.

146
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,600
I can reply to emails and cook pasta.

147
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,680
I can't play a VR game and cook pasta, right?

148
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,760
So it's a level of immersiveness.

149
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,360
Again, not that immersive is good or bad.

150
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,360
It's just a slider.

151
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,720
Persistence and here,

152
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,560
George has a different definition of persistence than my earlier definition of persistence,

153
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,640
which may end up right or

154
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
wrong.

155
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:14,720
Is it always on?

156
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,520
Does it follow you?

157
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
Things to imagine.

158
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,520
I'd say you had a virtual pet, right?

159
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,520
It comes with you.

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
It's there,

161
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:29,800
it's persistent, which is somehow similar to, you can leave and come back and it's still

162
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,960
there, that version of persistent, but it's a little bit different framework on.

163
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,240
And then the governance properties are interesting.

164
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,680
These are the types of topics that are exciting to me,

165
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,840
we'll talk about them a few slides down as well.

166
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:54,080
You know, data ownership, can users own the assets in the virtual world and can they

167
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,720
take them out of the metaverse to another virtual world?

168
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,520
It's interesting even hearing this definition.

169
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,560
Someone might ask, what's the metaverse and what's the virtual world and why are they

170
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
different?

171
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:16,000
We'll come to this question of is metaverse singular and metaverse plural.

172
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Openness can developers or in my view, I think individuals, it doesn't have to be developers,

173
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:32,720
Minecraft is, you don't need to be a developer to build things in Minecraft.

174
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,440
And is the virtual world open to developers to create spaces, experiences, objects, applications?

175
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,240
Is it customizable?

176
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:50,480
And then the censorship resistance, so the degree to which users can be prohibited from

177
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,160
accessing the virtual world restricted in their experiences or kicked off the metaverse

178
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,800
by some centralized authority who owns or controls the world.

179
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Yeah, this is my personal obsession,

180
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,720
arguably, I think today basically no metaverse is censorship resistant, and

181
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,280
there's always a counterparty that is controlling it.

182
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:25,240
I think this is an interesting and more practical framework for classifying metaverses or potential

183
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,240
metaverses.

184
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:33,600
And I think it's something that I don't assign work to anyone, but it could be, you could have this

185
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,800
grid and put different metaverses in this grid and see where they fall out.

186
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:50,080
Because I'm not advanced, I have a simpler definition of the metaverse, which is my framework

187
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,360
on it, which is just one sentence.

188
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:03,200
And my definition is, it is the internet with better visualization and persistent digital

189
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,600
objects.

190
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:23,320
And this is a quite different approach because I've kind of defined my way out of the singular

191
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:31,320
or plural metaverse question and there's a reason for this.

192
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:41,240
And I think my framework is going to be more relevant in the longer term.

193
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,440
I think the other framework is great for today, but I think it's more relevant in the longer

194
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
term.

195
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,920
Why do I think that?

196
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Imagine any type of world where we have all these, let's call them "metaverse experiences".

197
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,280
They're persistent, they're immersive, they may be photo realistic.

198
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,440
They follow us around.

199
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,000
They're probably AI enabled in many ways.

200
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,160
There'll be multiple things, it won't just be one thing, I don't think it'll just be

201
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,440
one metaverse and that metaverse is going to be Minecraft, right?

202
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:28,280
Well, imagine that's the case and it's not today, it's 10 years from now or 15 years from

203
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,440
now, or 20 years from now, it doesn't really matter when you pick.

204
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:42,280
I don't think in that world we will have the metaverse and separately, the internet.

205
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,880
I don't think you'll say, "oh, today I'm going to go use the internet and then later today

206
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,640
I'm going to go use the metaverse".

207
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:00,880
I think they're going to become the same thing, just like there was a time, maybe still true

208
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:09,320
today, that like, mobile apps was a different thing, mobile was a different thing than desktop.

209
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:16,640
I'm sure the phone factor is different, but I basically use more or less all the same

210
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:25,440
applications on the desktop and on my phone and, I don't know if that's like some separate

211
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,440
ecosystem.

212
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,000
Or here's another way to think about it.

213
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,440
Let's say you're in one of these, for argument's sake, three dimensional spaces.

214
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:45,480
It isn't going to be the case that if you want to have extended conversations or chats

215
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:50,360
with people in those spaces, you're going to leave them and go to some other chats

216
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,280
offer.

217
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,520
My guess is no, today the user experience, the user interface for having chats in these

218
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,680
three spaces is kind of wonky.

219
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:11,000
That's why I was still use Twitter and Discord and WhatsApp and Telegram and all these other

220
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
things, right?

221
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,720
But the idea that again, a decade from now, we have this kind of persistent immersive

222
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:30,000
environment and yet in order to chat to someone, in order to chat to someone, you have to

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,800
leave it, and go somewhere else,

224
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
makes no sense to me.

225
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,040
If you're still, if it's a decade from now and you still have to leave the quote/unquote

226
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:49,000
"metaverse" for me to send a DM to George, well, I mean, I don't think that metaverse will

227
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
be very effective.

228
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Is that okay?

229
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Well, okay, fine.

230
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We'll have you.

231
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What about other things?

232
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Email?

233
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,760
You know, I'm sure we'll have email a decade from now

234
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,680
but why can't I answer my email in that environment?

235
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:07,880
It's just a form factor, a UX UI for reading my email,

236
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,240
why can't I read my email in a private room?

237
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,400
Why do I have to read it in the interface that it has now?

238
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Well, sure,

239
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Okay,

240
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,880
but what about an old studio computer?

241
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,640
I watch a movie,

242
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Okay,

243
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,360
You can watch a movie in a three-year environment.

244
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,680
I want to work on Excel.

245
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:43,000
And in fact, you know, you could have, I assume by that point, you'll have much more screen

246
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
space to work with,

247
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,200
you might have many Excels out there.

248
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:58,200
So I just, I will be surprised if in the long run you go and spend a lot of time and some

249
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,240
type of immersive environment and then you leave it to do all the other stuff you do

250
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
now that's less immersive.

251
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:14,160
To put it differently, I think the immersive environment can subsume the non-emersive environment.

252
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,120
But I don't think the other way around works.

253
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,840
You can have a 2D chat box in a 3D space.

254
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,240
It's kind of hard to have a 3D space with a 2D chat box.

255
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:35,600
And so if you believe in this, I just don't see any way it's not going to be like this

256
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,440
then, the internet goes away.

257
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,680
Now it doesn't go away,

258
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,840
it's all right there.

259
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,560
It's been the plumbing of how we communicate in a distance for many decades.

260
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:57,360
But the idea that the internet and the metaverse are separate spaces, I think eventually ends.

261
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,880
It's an open question I'm willing to concede,

262
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,240
but I don't know when; is it in 10 years?

263
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,240
Is it in 7?

264
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Is it in 23?

265
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:17,040
But pick any arbitrary, arbitrary future point, 100 years from now.

266
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,320
We have human brain interfaces.

267
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
We don't even have physical devices.

268
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,440
You're thinking about something and you're seeing it in front of you directly through

269
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,440
your neurons.

270
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,040
Are you really going to separately go use the internet somewhere else?

271
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,040
I don't think so.

272
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
I think they merge.

273
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
And then they merge.

274
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,800
It's just the internet that they merge.

275
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
The metaverse is anyway running today on the internet.

276
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:49,240
The metaverse space we're talking about is running on the internet.

277
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,640
But what's the second pillar with better visualization?

278
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:07,920
And this concept of better visualization is one that is a consistent theme in the internet

279
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,160
since the day it started.

280
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,920
It used to be touch-based.

281
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
Then we got some pictures.

282
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,600
Then we got really lousy video.

283
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,240
An old enough term for when video was lousy on the internet.

284
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:31,160
And today you can watch an HD movie on the internet.

285
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:40,480
You can do a zoom and you have free global video conferencing on your laptop or even

286
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,480
on your phone.

287
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,480
Global video teleconference used to be a big company feature 15 years ago.

288
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,760
You went to a special conference room to do that.

289
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,480
And that's showing no sign of stopping.

290
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,480
What I think is going to be the transition now is 3D visualization, the browser, the

291
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,280
probably what is on the next side,

292
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:13,280
and then augmented and virtual reality belong to them where they'll be together.

293
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:21,000
I think once the devices get sufficiently functional, you'll have something like a pair

294
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
of sunglasses.

295
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,400
Those pair of sunglasses will be mostly an awkward to reality.

296
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,160
You'll also see the world around you, but also have digital objects there.

297
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,200
See your fiddens on your wall or you'll have your Phoenix all spreadsheets floating around,

298
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,720
but they'll have the ability to pop into virtual reality and hide the world around you.

299
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,160
And that's going to come.

300
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,440
It's not there yet.

301
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,600
I know of no specific person,

302
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,200
I'm sure there's some of the world's lessons, but I don't know any of them who wears a virtual

303
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,200
reality headset all day.

304
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,200
And there's a lot of excitement about the upcoming Apple augmented reality.

305
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,720
I'd say maybe this will be a step forward and this is not going to work right every

306
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,720
day.

307
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,680
Every year we'll have a step forward where the devices will get more functional, more practical,

308
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:17,120
and we will see this level of forwardness.

309
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,040
I don't think we're there yet.

310
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,160
I don't think it's like next year we're all going to be wearing AR and VR models.

311
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:39,360
And then for persistence, I think of it about the digital objects.

312
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,160
My mental models that will have persistent digital objects.

313
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
Now what's a digital object?

314
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
It'll be anything, right?

315
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,200
It could be a piece of art.

316
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,280
It could be an avatar.

317
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,040
It could be a wearable.

318
00:25:54,040 --> 00:26:01,840
It could be a specific three dimensional space in which you do something.

319
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,640
It could be a piece of "land".

320
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,840
The land is different than a space, right?

321
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,160
Land implies that there's some type of property that is surrounded by

322
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,760
other property and you own a specific property.

323
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,600
A space doesn't need to be the same as land, right?

324
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,880
You can have a space that's not tied to some property grid.

325
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:40,960
And my view of persistence is that they are there, when you come back.

326
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
Now, where that open metaverse stuff?

327
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,720
Well, it's not in the stuff initially.

328
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,160
But to me as a definition, you could imagine closed metaverses fulfilling these conditions.

329
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,120
And I think for the question over here, what's a metaverse?

330
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
That's fair.

331
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:05,400
There's going to be closed metaverses and they might even win or partially win.

332
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:13,840
So I don't think we can say that the definition of a metaverse by definition means it's open.

333
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,400
It might be closed.

334
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,040
We can think about what are the characteristics that make it open.

335
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,880
But it's not like it's a short thing, but it's going to be open.

336
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:32,240
But for me, these three things are the three main ones.

337
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
They cover all scenarios.

338
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,480
That is a less useful framework than say George's for classifying different metaverses

339
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,480
on different dimensions.

340
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:51,200
But it also, I think, is it covers almost any possible inconsolable manner.

341
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,880
I want to show an example here because I think people often, you say VR and AR, and this

342
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,880
all cannot make sense.

343
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,480
There is a 3D visualization browser.

344
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
What do you mean?

345
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:10,160
And this is a very silly example, but I think it illustrates the point.

346
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,720
These are both screen grabs from the browser.

347
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:24,760
And on the left is the website over the museum of modern art, a mobile that has the inventory

348
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,760
of everything at the moment.

349
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,520
That is perfectly fine and functional
350
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,680
and you can search by artist and you get this list of artwork.

351
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:42,960
And on the right is the generative gallery of the 6529 museum, also running in

352
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
the browser

353
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,120
but one of them is 3D.

354
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:55,880
And I think, over time, quite a few usage cases will migrate from the visualization on

355
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,240
the left to the visualization on the right.

356
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,920
Now, some things might stay on the visualization on the left for speed and ease of use

357
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:11,920
and certainly we are not particularly ready to go to the right because they are still

358
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,920
all of them are wonky.

359
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:26,040
Even, do I think, oh, which is where this is on the right, is ready for prime time,

360
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,200
retail, consumer use?

361
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:34,480
That's okay, it's still early. Over the course of the next few years,

362
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:42,320
we'll sort out how to make these spaces functional and fast and performant

363
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:47,320
and people will figure out what is the model for moving around these spaces.

364
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,160
Everyone now knows the model for working on the web.

365
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,120
But it took a long time to sort that out.

366
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,560
But I do think there are many usage cases where looking at something with this more expressive

367
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
visualization has got to make sense.

368
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,840
And as I was saying, you can put goggles on and go into VR into that gallery.

369
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,840
Yeah, that's true.

370
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,840
It can.

371
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,080
But VR is there now.

372
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,240
And so it's not, actually, don't think it's the rendering that's hugely the problem

373
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
right now.

374
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,240
I think it's the devices.

375
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,680
Yes, that gallery, we can see it in VR

376
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
and I've seen it once in VR.

377
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,120
And every other time I went, I just went to the browser because I wasn't going to go

378
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,440
get VR goggles and put them on just to go and insert something.

379
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,840
So until that becomes easier, I think it's going to be mostly, most of the screen time

380
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,040
is going to be in the browser not in VR and 3D on your browser or your computer, not

381
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
in VR, we will get there in time,

382
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
but not yet.

383
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:07,840
Anybody definition raises a question, which is a general question of, is metaverse a

384
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,840
singular or plural word?

385
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840


386
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,840


387
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,840

388
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:25,840
And I'll say as always, I don't know.

389
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:34,800
Nobody knows.

390
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:54,840
But I will throw out a concept about how potentially, we can resolve it.

391
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:03,560
And maybe the concept, which I think matters more, my definition is all unbiased, I think.

392
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:11,760
My concept is that today they are plural and that some sufficiently far off time in the

393
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,720
future, it's singular.

394
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,720
Why are they plural today?

395
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:27,600
Well, because today, metaverse spaces are a small fraction of the internet

396
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:37,120
and so you kind of need the word to distinguish them from a regular website or a regular mobile

397
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,120
application.

398
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,520
It's very clear that not every website is a metaverse, right?

399
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,360
And not every mobile application is a metaverse.

400
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:57,440
And there is obviously more than one competing for this idea of being a metaverse.

401
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,960
So I think today, it's sensibly a plural topic.

402
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:15,520
If this is correct, but in the long run, the internet won't really be a different thing,

403
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:24,160
I think in the long run, it's not going to make as much sense that they are plural, I

404
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
think.

405
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,680
I think the whole thing is going to just be metaverse.

406
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,520
The way to think about it is, I don't know, imagine a kid growing up in 2040.

407
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:45,000
You know, if you have spent any time around young kids today and you're a little bit older, like

408
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:54,200
I am, it's a little bit disconcerting that they look at the TV as kind of being a subset

409
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,800
of an iPad or something, right?

410
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:02,520
A TV is a poorly functioning iPad,

411
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:13,240
you can't do things on demand and, you know, I mean, linear TV, right?

412
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,840
And then, you know, with smart TVs, you end up getting the YouTube and Netflix and whatever

413
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
applications on them

414
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,920
and so, they just become an iPad.

415
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:32,040
The linear TV part of the TV is close to irrelevant.

416
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,680
And that's weird,

417
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:42,120
if you remember, like I remember, when TV was one thing and streaming video was something

418
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:53,680
else, so you turn on TV and you watch on NBC, the Thanksgiving Day Parade, it's on NBC or it's

419
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,680
on CBS, however

420
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,720
tomorrow you'll turn on network TV and you'll watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

421
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:05,280
And then you'd go to your computer, to the internet, and watch a YouTube video.

422
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:15,800
And those were very distinct things and there were whole reports about internet video and

423
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,680
video on demand and over the top video and I think those reports still exist, right?

424
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:30,480
And if I look at older people, there's the most you watch a linear TV and you're going

425
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,720
to get a little bit on their iPad or what have you and they're still very distinct.

426
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:47,080
But if someone doesn't have the history and is starting you, the idea of telerestrials

427
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:54,680
or cable or linear TV is absurd and irrelevant and stupid, right?

428
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,000
It's all video and they're just different screens.

429
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:09,840
I think very abstractly, very conceptually, that's how it's going to be.

430
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,400
You know, once these metaverse spaces are performant and simple to use and in any case,

431
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,840
I believe it's going to be easy to go from one to another, even in the closed case.

432
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,720
I think it is going to be easy to go from one to another.

433
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:40,600
Then someone who does not have the prior experience of a pre-metaverse internet, I think it's

434
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:45,200
just going to be the one thing that you go and do things.

435
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I'm not specific applications there, right?

436
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,200
And yeah, maybe the one by then is not going to be metaverse, right?

437
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,360
Maybe there'll be something else.

438
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,440
But I do think it's going to be unified in the end.

439
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:02,720
I don't think it's going to be a bunch of different ones.

440
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:10,240
Now, just conceptually here, we're not going to get into so much details on each one

441
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,880
of these, but where were what might be the earliest metaverse?

442
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,920
You know, multi-user versions were text-based and they had characters and you interacted

443
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,920
with people.

444
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,920
Immersive?

445
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:42,160
Anyway, now on George's framework, not in the slightest but photo-realistic, but not

446
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
necessarily relevant

447
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:49,880
so we started here, right?

448
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,080
And then we got some graphics.

449
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:56,520
And shared, shared version, right?

450
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,520
But then we got some better graphics.

451
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,520
And a little bit more of a virtual world, right?

452
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:06,320
This is all very early

453
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
work.

454
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:19,960
But I'm not sure they are conceptually different from us bouncing around and essential and

455
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,840
or all know whatever now.

456
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
How are they conceptually different?

457
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:30,600
Is anything different other than the graphics are better?

458
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,440
Is anything different other than the graphics are better,

459
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,400
well, maybe now we have NFTs, which is a very specific topic, but for the metaverse aspect,

460
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:49,200
I think the fundamental principles were already there in this year.

461
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:59,360
And then I think the very obvious, you know, we come decades ahead.

462
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:07,480
I think there's an excellent case that the massively multiplayer online role playing

463
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,480
games are in the concept of plural metaverses, they're metaverses.

464
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:25,440
A bit older, you enter a specific node, you have a specific role or character or avatar.

465
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:36,200
There's persistence in some of these there are economies.

466
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:44,280
I would credit them with being a metaverse research.

467
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,000
Even our social layer metaverses have been doing it for a long time.

468
00:39:49,000 --> 00:40:00,520
Second life, very famously, got a lot of traction trying to build a metaverse in the

469
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
2000s,

470
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,520
it's been at least 10 years.

471
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:12,520
I'm going to have to check exactly when it started.

472
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:22,040
But it's been the same concepts as well there

473
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:32,400
and a lot of the things we're seeing now with the blockchain based social virtual worlds

474
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,040
existed then IBM is going to open a campus in Second Life.

475
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,160
Some universities can open a campus in Second Life.

476
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,440
Some retail stores are going to open a store in Second Life.

477
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,360
We went through that cycle

478
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:56,360
and it didn't totally quite stick with Second Life.

479
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,960
Second Life is still up and running

480
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,520
but it didn't take over the world the way.

481
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,440
some people might have thought that it would.

482
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,640
Here's another one.

483
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,600
I ask myself this.

484
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:22,480
Is NFT, Twitter and Discord a metaverse?

485
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,080
Are those avatars or persistent digital objects?

486
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:39,880
The world itself is persistent, my Twitter feed is persistent, my Discord feed is persistent.

487
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:51,240
I come into them and I see the same type of people, characters, etc.

488
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,920
There's definitely an economy.

489
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:08,040
There is in fact a self-soverign economy because that economy primarily runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

490
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm thinking back to George's six factors.

491
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,720
It's not photo-realistic.

492
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:28,400
But OK maybe I'll it a little bit.

493
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:34,360
Is NFT, Twitter and Discord and OpenSea and Oncyber and on-central and in some is this

494
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
a metaverse?

495
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,000
Sort of, I think.

496
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,400
Is it fully polished and integrated?

497
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,400
No.

498
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,680
Is it a metaverse?

499
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I think.

500
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I think it is.

501
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:59,880
And it's weird because here there's not one platform.

502
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:13,600
Here what is to some degree serving as the unifying link is it there?

503
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:20,680
And is it fully integrated that I signed Punk 6529 on Twitter and I signed Punk 6529

504
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
on Discord?

505
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
Why don't I sign on Discord?

506
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I could.

507
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I guess.

508
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Do it cloud-land.

509
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Do I Oncyber and on?

510
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,880
Yeah, I do.

511
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:40,640
And so, it feels to me that this is one a relatively more decentralized metaverse or relatively

512
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:47,680
where the layer that ties people together imperfectly today.

513
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:56,480
And with a lot of noise, not full signal, a lot of noise, is the Ethereum option?

514
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,560
What's some other examples?

515
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
What can I go?

516
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,560
Okay.

517
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I'm just a parent.

518
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,560
Does it have some metaverse characteristic?

519
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Yeah, it's persistent.

520
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
Is there a community?

521
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,560
Yeah.

522
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Is it a game?

523
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
I don't know

524
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:13,560
ask this question in a couple of seconds.

525
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:24,680
Where is the line between any multiplayer game, and I also need this for the massively

526
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:32,040
multiplayer online games, and Pokemon Go?

527
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,080
Are the games or are the metaverse?

528
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,440
I don't know.

529
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:40,520
Is every game a metaverse?

530
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:45,480
Does that just mean all games are metaverses?

531
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,640
It feels like it diminishes the term of it.

532
00:44:52,640 --> 00:45:02,640
Also I feel like it diminishes the concept of metaverses, plural.

533
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:15,160
Because you can't, there's no obvious stopping point on the point on when it's no longer a metaverse.

534
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:28,640
So it's why my mental model often goes to someday it's just going to be metaverse singular.

535
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:38,000
And then you don't have to have these highly theoretical discussions of is this a game, or

536
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,000
is this a metaverse?

537
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Is this a virtual world?

538
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Is this a metaverse?

539
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,920
Is this social media or is it a metaverse?

540
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:52,480
Seems unhelpful, not particularly clear.

541
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,120
And things that are unhelpful, frameworks are unhelpful and not particularly clear and don't

542
00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:04,480
drive any particular changes in behavior possibly might be not perfectly fine-tuned to the

543
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,280
environment.

544
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,960
Then we have the ones in our spaces, you know, the central and crypto console, some in other

545
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:24,720
side, all of these that tend to be NFT based for the land assets.

546
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:32,920
We do tend to have a centralized rendering delivery system.

547
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:40,280
We'll talk about that in the very last session of the course.

548
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,320
Here's my game slide.

549
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,520
Is it a game or is it a metaverse?

550
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,840
It doesn't matter.

551
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,840
Right?

552
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:54,840
Does that mean none of these things matter?

553
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,120
Instead of fighting what exactly is or isn't a metaverse,

554
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,920
if you go to the generic definition that it is, the internet with better visualization

555
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,840
and persistent digital objects starts to get interesting.

556
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:17,680
You sidestep all these questions.

557
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,360
Let's talk about openness for a second.

558
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,920
We'll talk about a lot more in session 12.

559
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,280
That's why I haven't got into great detail here

560
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:37,560
but I think it is useful to at least touch upon it a little bit.

561
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,440
All of these are versions of openness.

562
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,600
Some of them more open than others, I think.

563
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,160
Let's start at the top.

564
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,160
Interoperability.

565
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:55,240
All of the big closed metaverses are going to talk about this.

566
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,240
Why?

567
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:03,320
Because partially for PR reasons, regulators like interoperability, and so

568
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:10,560
nobody is going to come say, I don't want to be interoperable with others.

569
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,880
There are also cases where interoperability helps the big guys because they can absorb

570
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,880
other users.

571
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:29,280
And so expect from the big closed platforms, none of them are going to say that they're

572
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
closed.

573
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:39,360
What they're going to say is "we are absolutely in favor of interoperability".

574
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:46,160
That interoperability, of course, is going to be driven through closed systems and some

575
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,200
interaction models with closed systems.

576
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:57,040
And usually what happens in this case is there's a game to make it easy to come into

577
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:08,840
your world or application or what have you, and make it hard or inconvenient to leave.

578
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:21,480
This is usually how people deal with interoperability.

579
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,840
Let's say that is the absolute bottom layer of openness.

580
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:37,040
Let's say the next layer, which is where most of the activity today is in the space.

581
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,920
This is like a kind of five step model.

582
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:47,760
A lot of people say, yeah, no, all your digital objects.

583
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:54,040
Your land in, fill-in-the-bank is an NFT.

584
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,040
We can't take it from you.

585
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,880
So that's good.

586
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,320
It's certainly better and from my opinion, better than the alternative.

587
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:11,040
But also, this usually comes with a bunch of terms and conditions.

588
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:16,080
If you want to play this object in our world, you got to do these things or we can kick

589
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:21,520
you out, which is different than saying, you know, Bitcoin.

590
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,040
Bitcoin does not come with terms and conditions like Bitcoin.

591
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:32,720
No one can kick you out of the Bitcoin world.

592
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,720
Next topic.

593
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,720
Governance models.

594
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,720
Is someone in charge?

595
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:43,640
Some of the metaverse NFT/metaverse platforms, games, etc.

596
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,520
It's very clear there's a company in charge.

597
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:53,680
They make the decisions and you play as a customer in effect.

598
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:04,080
Some others have some form of partially decentralized governments where different districts can

599
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:13,320
make decisions for themselves, but they do still, I think, fall within broader top-level

600
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,960
governments.

601
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:17,960
Next topic, what's the client?

602
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:22,880
You know, what's the client and what's the server, do the client and the server go together?

603
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:28,040
You know, some folks are trying to do open the Web3 types of servers, what we need in

604
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,040
the browser.

605
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,880
There's a some downsides, you know, that infrastructure is more developed to doing it

606
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,280
with one of the gaming platforms

607
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:43,880
but browsers are more open

608
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:46,880
as a endpoint.

609
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,880
I think nobody has right now, there's multiple rendering environments.

610
00:51:53,880 --> 00:52:04,400
Like on all these, you have to go, even the ones who have open clients and ownership of

611
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:16,480
digital objects as NFTs, there's still a form of interoperability as opposed to being

612
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,480
fully decentralized and open

613
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,480
and if it's fully decentralized and open, again, the rental model is Bitcoin; anyone can run

614
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:32,480
a Bitcoin client, anyone can run a Bitcoin miner, you don't have to go to Bitcoin.com to

615
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
do something.

616
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:45,440
Today, every one of the platforms, you have to go to a platform-name.com or.io to run

617
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
a Bitcoin miner.

618
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,440
It is a point of centralization.

619
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,440
It's a point of not censorship-resistant.

620
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,440
Everything we've got in the whole sale, I can't get one, but you can take them and rebuild

621
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,440
them somewhere else, and yeah, that's fine.

622
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,440
But that's some more interoperability.

623
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,440
It's the last...

624
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,440
What I'd like to see, or I'd like to get to it, is I might not get to, which is why I'm

625
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,440
not saying all of these things yet, because it's not.

626
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,440
I hope to get them.

627
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,440
It's not today.

628
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,440
So, is that anyone can do any of these things?

629
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,440
Like the Internet.

630
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:29,440
There is not one place you can have a website.

631
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:37,440
Even if it's on popular website, confidential systems, WordPress, there's not one place

632
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,440
where you can run WordPress.

633
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,440
You can host your site on WordPress.org.

634
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:53,440
But if you also download WordPress Self-Reserving chosen, you can run the WordPress software

635
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:54,440
by yourself.

636
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,440
You don't need anyone's permission to do this.

637
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:04,440
There is no global governance governing one WordPress site.

638
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,440
There's not one company that owns all the WordPress sites.

639
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,440
It's all right.

640
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,440
And this is, I guess, metaverse is going to be exactly WordPress? No, but it's a useful

641
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,440
example to think about.

642
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,440
Are there centralized companies that are built on top of WordPress? Sure

643
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,440
Are some of them variable?

644
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
Sure.

645
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,440
Is WordPress centralized?

646
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,440
No, it's not.

647
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
It's open.

648
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,440
It's decentralized.

649
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:37,440
So, I think these are things we'll talk about more in four weeks, but I do want to, like,

650
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,440
introduce them to the discussion.

651
00:54:40,440 --> 00:55:04,440
Now, let me pause there because I'm on one hour and three minutes.

652
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:12,440
So, we'll switch to questions.

653
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:20,440
But I do think the three big takeaways, I would say, the is a new found interest in the

654
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
metaverse.

655
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:28,440
Anyways, multiple potential frameworks on what THE metaverse or A metaverse is,

656
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,440
and there's multiple different candidates over the years of things that could have been

657
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,440
or might have been metaverses.

658
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,440
And I think all of these are works in progress and a space where I think it's going to evolve

659
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,440
very quickly.

660
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,440
In five, ten, fifteen, twenty years, we're going to have a different framework on these

661
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,440
topics.

662
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:55,440
So, let me open up my chat so I can see

663
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:02,440
and then I'll switch to questions.

664
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,440

665
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,440

666
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,440

667
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,440

668
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:46,440

669
00:56:46,440 --> 00:57:04,440

670
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Okay.

671
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,440
First question.

672
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,440
"Why doesn't your definition include decentralized platforms?

673
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
It's so important."

674
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
Yeah, I agree.

675
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:22,440
I'm running around, tweeting all day long about the open metaverse.

676
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,440
But I need to be in touch and honest in this presentation because it is perfectly possible

677
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:36,440
that the open metaverse doesn't happen.

678
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:44,440
I hope that's not the case.

679
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:49,440
I'm spending an infinite amount of time hoping it does happen.

680
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,440
But the metaverse could exist

681
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,440
that is closed.

682
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,440
And I think it would still be a metaverse.

683
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,440
It would be a closed metaverse.

684
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,440
I'd be less happy about it, but there is no reason why it couldn't exist


685
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,440
So, me, as 6529 believe in open metaverse.

686
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:18,440
Me as someone running your presentation on what a metaverse is, I don't think it is by definition

687
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,440
decentralized.

688
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,440
An open metaverse might be.

689
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
Right?

690
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:26,440
That's why I added the slide on open.

691
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:33,440
"The Giaglis Framework seems to bridge metaverse with a Web3 ethos.

692
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
Is that the intention?

693
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Because not all visions of the metaverse do this."

694
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,440
Yeah, now I noticed that when I read it.

695
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,440
George is a crypto person, has been for a very long time.

696
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,440
And so,

697
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I am not surprised that there is a Web3 ethos embedded in his metaverse framework.

698
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:04,440
And I think a lot of people who do not come from this Web3/Crypto aspect 

699
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:19,440
do not include those parameters at all

700
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,440
So, I'm glad he has included them.

701
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:36,440
Does the 6529 framework believe they will be connected?

702
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,440
Well, I hope so.

703
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,440
I hope the basis, I'm parking this until week 12

704
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,440
because week 12, I'm going to be a little bit more personal.

705
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,440
And a week eight, I'm trying to be a little bit more neutral

706
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,440
I guess.

707
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:58,440
My view is that we

708
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,440
have a mechanism to make them interoperable.

709
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:06,440
and that mechanism is a kind of tease.

710
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:15,440
And instead of having some large organizations decide on interoperability standards,

711
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,440
but fundamentally work in closed

712
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,440
environments.

713
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,440


714
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,440
NFTs are fundamentally open environment

715
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,440
and then people can build on top of them

716
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:40,440
but I want to talk about that in the week 12.

717
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,440
There were heading away from.

718
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,440
An objective understanding of the situation to my personal belief

719
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,440
on what would be better.

720
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,440
"What is the overlap between the concepts of metaverse and cryptocurrency?"

721
01:00:55,440 --> 01:01:01,440
Well, if you want a

722
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,440
closed metaverse, you don't need any.

723
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,440
You can run a close metaverse where

724
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,440
people own the game objects, but in

725
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,440
Epic's database, people can pay for them with credits in

726
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,440
Epic's database.

727
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,440


728
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:28,440

729
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,440
A lot of companies are going to do that, to be honest.

730
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,440
So,

731
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,440
if you want an open

732
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,440
metaverse

733
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:46,440
with not one party in charge with not one person's database in charge.

734
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Well, then you need something that's on a database and that's really a blockchain and specifically a public blockchain, which is what we call a cryptocurrency or crypto asset.

735
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:02,440
So, that is a good question.

736
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:08,440
I thought there was a social aspect to the metaverse versus just the 3D space, but it wasn't included in the definitions.

737
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:11,440
This is a very good point

738
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,440
and we need to think about it.

739
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,440
That needs to get on the slide somewhere.

740
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:22,440
Yeah, for sure

741
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:23,440
there's a social aspect

742
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,440
and it's kind of implicitly there

743
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,440
and it should be made explicitly there,

744
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:34,440
I mean, one mental model that I sometimes have 

745
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,440
are

746
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:43,440
metaverses just social networks

747
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,440
with just different visualizations.

748
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,440
But overall, those are social networks.

749
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:58,440
I don't know.

750
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,440
But we need to put a slide in there, which says this

751
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,440
explicitly.

752
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:17,440
High risk that large companies get to set the rules for metaverse, is that a threat or a possibility in your opinion. Yes, in fact, the whole reason 6529 exists is that I think that

753
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:19,440
that is a very high risk.

754
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,440
I think that is the default case.

755
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,440
I think the default case is that

756
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:32,440
metaverses will become like Web2, they will be centralized in 5, 10, 15, 20 companies

757
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:34,440
and I think that's about outcome,

758
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:45,440
and that's my personal opinion. I don't think that's an objective view about the metaverse someone might have. Someone from Meta might think it's better not to be that way.

759
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,440
I mean, to be that way, but,

760
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,440
for sure I think it's worse.

761
01:03:51,440 --> 01:04:03,440
"Do you believe in a future of the concept of land and gravity in metaverse? To me, they seem like artificial limitations of limit the entry barrier as people are familiar with

762
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,440
these concepts."

763
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:15,440
Well, I mean,

764
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:23,440
I hear this fairly often.

765
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:33,440
From people who are

766
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,440
very deep into the space.

767
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,440
And as hell these things are just total skill morphism.

768
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,440
They're limitations.

769
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,440
We don't need to stick to the land concept.

770
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:50,440
We don't need to stick to the human scale concept.

771
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:58,440
And I appreciate that in theory

772
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,440
now, without a counter argument

773
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,440
which is the following.

774
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,440
The counter argument is,

775
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:14,440
almost we've been making video games for several decades now

776
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:20,440
a,nd those video games

777
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:22,440
have been

778
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:25,440
overwhelmingly

779
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,440


780
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:46,440
skeuomorphic with land and gravity and things of that nature.

781
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:59,440
I think there is something to that,

782
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:07,440
I don't think it's accidental

783
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:17,440
that almost all games match these types of models. I don't think it's an accident.

784
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:22,440
I also have

785
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:28,440
seen attempts to make hugely conceptual spaces

786
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:31,440
and every attempt I've seen so far,

787
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:34,440
has been kind of junk.

788
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:37,440
Now, maybe the space is really good, but the problem is like

789
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,440
our mental models are stuck on

790
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,440
things looking a little bit like the real world.

791
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,440
Maybe.

792
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,440
But it's kind of six and one and a half dozen of the other.

793
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,440
It's.

794
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,440


795
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:02,440
I have yet to see one where it works.

796
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,440
So in theory,

797
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,440
yes, these are official limitations and we can do whatever we want,

798
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,440
and practice,

799
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,440
whatever we want.

800
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,440
So far has ended up looking

801
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,440
kind of like the real world.

802
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,440
Now, not exactly like the real world but,

803
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,440
there's gravity in home, for example, but not a lot of gravity,

804
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,440
you can jump really high.

805
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:27,440
So

806
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,440
to prove it otherwise,

807
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:37,440
I would expect most things will somehow correlate with real world 

808
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,440
concepts.

809
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,440
"Thoughts on digital twins using the metaverse."

810
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,440
So digital twins are a digital representation of something in the

811
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:45,440
physical world,

812
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,440
and they came out of the world of like

813
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:51,440
high end equipment manufacturing and so on.

814
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:55,440
And so you have like a turbine and you make a physical copy of the turbine and

815
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,440
you put on the physical turbine sensors

816
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,440
and those sensors feed data to the digital twin

817
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,440
and so you can watch and monitor,

818
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,440
the

819
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,440
turbine

820
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,440
during

821
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,440
In the digital world.

822
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:14,440
And you know

823
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,440
say, oh, look, there's

824
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,440
data is coming out of line,

825
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,440
the turbines are not behaving normally,

826
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:22,440
let's go fix it in the physical world before it breaks.

827
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:23,440
Now there's other use cases too

828
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:27,440
I think in time you'll have cities where you'll see full in some

829
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,440
cities, there are cities with digital twins, but they'll get better where

830
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,440
you'll say, look, we're monitoring traffic flows and pollution and waste

831
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,440
water and disease spread.

832
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:41,440
Absolutely is going to exist

833
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:46,440
I think for

834
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,440
kind of boring

835
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:54,440
I'm sorry, not boring, what is the word I'm looking for.

836
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,440
Institutional use.

837
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,440
Not like hanging out fun social use actually think digital twins are going

838
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,440
to be very important

839
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,440
because they will give us

840
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,440
a viable

841
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,440
model

842
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,440
to improve the real world and monitor the real world better.

843
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:15,440
So I'm fairly bullish on these as a concept

844
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:18,440
I can't an architecture.

845
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:20,440
How do we protect these from being copied?

846
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:25,440
I don't think it's easy to be honest.

847
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,440
Just like anything else on the Internet,

848
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,440
how do you protect them from being copied?

849
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,440
Not that easily.

850
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,440
So what do you have to aim for?

851
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,440
Well, the same,

852
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:40,440
I mean, it's a version of right click.

853
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:48,440
And so you're going to have to have some concept of

854
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,440
providence

855
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:55,440
for that

856
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,440

857
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:01,440
not to be a big issue.

858
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:05,440
But I do think like, if you make a cool looking building somewhere

859
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,440
might someone copy it somewhere else?

860
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,440
yeah, I think that one comes.

861
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:15,440
I don't see it obviously for it not to happen

862
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,440
so I think given what we've learned from NFTs,

863
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,440
if

864
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:27,440
X copy makes some cool X copy building

865
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:31,440
and there are 1000 tokens of that X copy building

866
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,440
and 

867
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,440
you own one of those,

868
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,440
that's going to be different

869
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:47,440
and more valuable than someone who just right clicked saved your X copy building.

870
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:56,440
So I suspect we're going to have to use the same frameworks and mental models that we use for digital art for digital buildings.

871
01:10:56,440 --> 01:10:58,440
I don't see any other

872
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:01,440
way around it.

873
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:09,440
You want provenance and tokenization

874
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:15,440
to manage this topic.

875
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,440
There's a question that I don't have about the slightest idea what it means

876
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,440
or how to answer it but I'm going to read it because it's amuzing.

877
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:28,440
"Is a metaverse a way of function with multiple potentials with collapsing one through observation?

878
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,440
I think quantum computers will drastically change the metaverse definitions."

879
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:38,440
I kind of understand the words

880
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,440
and sort of the concepts behind this

881
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,440
I just don't have any idea how to answer this question.

882
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:47,440
So I didn't think it would be hard to read it for everyone

883
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:52,440
in case it's helpful for anyone else.

884
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,440
"What's the best book you've read about constructs?"

885
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,440
I mean the classic book on this right is Snow Crash,

886
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,440
everyone starts there.

887
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:09,440
Actually I think a book that people don't think of as directly being a metaverse book.

888
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:12,440
It is kind of a metaverse book.

889
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:22,440
A mixed reality metaverse book is the series of

890
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:32,440
Demon and Freedom.

891
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,440
So,

892
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:42,440
it's interesting because it's basically a gaming platform.

893
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:47,440
Like wild and started.

894
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:50,440
Impacting behavior in the real world,

895
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:55,440
and it is a form of metaverse,

896
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:59,440
I think.

897
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,440
A kind of an abstract form of metaverse like some of these ones we're talking about

898
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:09,440
so I threw it out there not because it's...

899
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,440
it's not a classic book of the genre

900
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,440
but I think there's a mental model that you could view it there and I find it's interesting.

901
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,440
"Aren't you afraid that the metaverse will become a trap?  

902
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,440
A.I. and robotics throw us from offices

903
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,440
there'll be nothing to do.

904
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,440
The metaverse can be such a golden cage to socialize and entertain us."

905
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,440
Well, I mean

906
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:38,440
I'm not sure I believe the premises of this question.

907
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:45,440
But, if A.I. and robotics start doing all the work for us,

908
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:50,440
we probably will hang out in the metaverse more.

909
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:54,440
I know this question is written with a value judgment in it.

910
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,440
But,

911
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,440
maybe the value judgment is opposite.

912
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:02,440
Maybe if the machines do all of our

913
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:04,440
work for us

914
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:09,440
we can be the people focused on

915
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,440
self development and self expression.

916
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,440
I'm a little skeptical of how that will play out.

917
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,440
It hasn't played out and I'm

918
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:23,440
actually not sure it's super healthy for humans not to have challenges

919
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,440
so I don't know if it's going to play out that way.

920
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:35,440
But yeah, I mean conceivably in the world that the A.I.s are good enough to do all our work,

921
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:40,440
but not good enough to get rid of us,

922
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:44,440
will we keep ourselves, or to frame it differently,

923
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,440
keep ourselves more occupied with social activities from people around the world?

924
01:14:49,440 --> 01:14:51,440
Sure.

925
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,440
Is that metaverse a golden cage?

926
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:54,440
Maybe

927
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,440
but like

928
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,440
I don't know if there's any more of a golden cage than Twitter is today.

929
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:03,440
And some people say, oh, putters not.

930
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,440
It's taking people away from real life.

931
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:15,440

932
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:25,440

933
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:30,440
Do you see our visual one largely the same as we come up on a year of their deal?

934
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,440
Yeah

935
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:32,440
more or less exactly the same

936
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,440
I'll talk about it more in week 12

937
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:39,440
and I want to make the session more general.

938
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,440
Okay, I think we're an hour and a half.

939
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,440
Let's wrap it here.

940
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:49,440
Thank you as always for joining.

941
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:52,440
We'll make the announcements in a little bit about

942
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,440
regional and course logistics a little bit so we can start getting the guests back and coming.

943
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,440
There's just an awful lot going on and the teams are doing a great job

944
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,440
working on things.

945
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:09,440
So we're just going to give ourselves a little bit more breathing room to get everything done.

946
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,440
Can anyone build them on the other?

947
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:12,440
You need to.

948
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,440
Can anyone can use a space and put NFT's in it.

949
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,440
If you want to design spaces, you do need some

950
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:22,440
experience and 3D modeling, but if you have that, yes, you can do that.

951
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,440
All right, everyone.

952
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Thank you so much as always.

953
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:30,440
And I'll see you back on Twitter.

954
01:16:30,440 --> 01:16:34,440
Sure.
