00:00.000 --> 00:21.720


00:21.720 --> 00:24.560


00:24.560 --> 00:29.960


00:29.960 --> 00:44.600

00:44.600 --> 00:49.960

00:49.960 --> 00:54.160
This is session eight of the course.

00:54.160 --> 01:02.120
We're going to talk about what is the metaverse, what is a metaverse, what are metaverses,

01:02.120 --> 01:07.400
and I can give you the exciting conclusion from now we're not going to know the answer.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.120
I don't know the answer, I don't think anyone else knows the answer.

01:11.120 --> 01:17.960
So what we are going to do today is, I think ask the questions more than conclude on the

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
answers.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.880
I also want to say something about scheduling which George and I agreed on earlier today,

01:24.880 --> 01:27.160
but we need to announce it online.

01:27.160 --> 01:34.960
We have a lot of guests and it's been hard to get the sessions out and get all the guests

01:34.960 --> 01:40.880
here so we're going to extend the course and particularly the time for the guests into

01:40.880 --> 01:41.880
January.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.240
We'll do the sessions on time and we'll do the guest, some of them now and some of them

01:45.240 --> 01:51.200
in January so we can fit everyone in because it's just to get everyone's schedules

01:51.200 --> 01:55.840
coordinated but we will go through as planned.

01:55.840 --> 02:02.160
And so as with other sessions, this is a session where we will get some concepts in

02:02.160 --> 02:12.640
place and we are then going to talk about then we're going to talk about some of these topics

02:12.640 --> 02:17.440
with some of the guests.

02:17.440 --> 02:28.680
So let me, I only have two titles for this session, Metaverse frameworks and Metaverses

02:28.680 --> 02:36.600
with a question mark and we'll talk about what these might be.

02:36.600 --> 02:45.840
So, it's clear that there is now much more interest in Metaverse than there has been

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
historically.

02:46.840 --> 02:55.400
This is the Google Trends data from 2004 and basically it's a flat line on the floor

02:55.400 --> 02:58.320
until basically last year.

02:58.320 --> 03:06.640
And some interest picked up, then Facebook announced changing their name, etc.

03:06.640 --> 03:17.400
interest shot up and has now pulled off a little bit, but at hugely higher levels than

03:17.400 --> 03:18.920
we were before.

03:18.920 --> 03:28.760
And so I think it is fair to say that it is a topic that has now attracted a lot of interest.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.760
It is a topic that has attracted interest from civilians.

03:32.760 --> 03:40.480
I mean, it's interesting because I think some of us, you know, people with a more sci-fi

03:40.480 --> 03:47.960
type orientation have considered the Metaverse to be kind of an obvious thing for forever.

03:47.960 --> 03:51.040
I mean, decades.

03:51.040 --> 03:58.160
But you can see from the Google Search data that this has absolutely not been the case

03:58.160 --> 03:59.160
in general.

03:59.160 --> 04:08.080
You know, civilian interest in the Metaverse is maybe 12 to 18 months old.

04:08.080 --> 04:09.560
It's a great,

04:09.560 --> 04:25.160
so we're going to have a Metaverse and the interesting thing is, I think as many people

04:25.160 --> 04:31.960
as have written or spoken about the Metaverse as many people have written as one of those,

04:31.960 --> 04:33.960
that's how many definitions are the Metaverse

04:33.960 --> 04:38.400
and it's very interesting because I mean, I don't think any of them are right, but also

04:38.400 --> 04:40.960
I don't think any of them are wrong.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.000
And I want to go through these aren't you going to read these

04:43.000 --> 04:47.040
because I think these are very interesting because they give you a sense of the different

04:47.040 --> 04:50.040
ways people are thinking about.

04:50.040 --> 04:56.880
Some people are just hugely aspirational, very non-specific,

04:56.880 --> 05:01.360
it's not a big shock that McKinsey's in that bucket.

05:01.360 --> 05:07.360
But you know, the Metaverse seems to be whatever people's imaginations dream it to

05:07.360 --> 05:08.360
be. The verge,

05:08.360 --> 05:12.480
it's partially a dream for the future of the Internet.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.200
JPMorgan, the seamless conversion of our physical and digital lives

05:16.200 --> 05:22.880
and I mean, I think all of these are true, but they don't really give you much to, you

05:22.880 --> 05:24.440
know, hang your hat on.

05:24.440 --> 05:28.200
Then there's folks who get much more specific

05:28.200 --> 05:32.560
so we'll see you on that bit.

05:32.560 --> 05:39.600
In a time 3D social medium where people can create and engage in shared experiences as

05:39.600 --> 05:46.280
equal participants in an economy of societal impact.

05:46.280 --> 05:51.960
Matthew Ball, who has written a lot about the Metaverse, a massively scaled and interoperable

05:51.960 --> 05:59.040
network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds, which can be experienced synchronously and

05:59.040 --> 06:05.800
persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence

06:05.800 --> 06:08.640
and with continuity of data.

06:08.640 --> 06:18.280
I think a definition like this is actually what most people, most civilians think of

06:18.280 --> 06:19.280
here.

06:19.280 --> 06:28.120
I think most civilians, when you tell the Metaverse, they're like, it's a 3D world and I probably

06:28.120 --> 06:32.560
have to put VR goggles and I'm not sure how interesting this is

06:32.560 --> 06:35.600
and anyway, it's not something I want to do

06:35.600 --> 06:38.680
and a lot of people are like that.

06:38.680 --> 06:44.560
And then there's these, I'd say more conceptual definitions where I'd put these conceptual

06:44.560 --> 06:48.760
definitions of like the Metaverse is already kind of here.

06:48.760 --> 06:54.200
You know, the Metaverse is not 3D or 2D or even necessarily graphical,

06:54.200 --> 06:59.840
It's about the inexorable dematerialization of physical space, distance and objects, John

06:59.840 --> 07:00.840
Radoffin.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.960
I like this one, to be honest.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.760
This is probably closer to my view,

07:05.760 --> 07:08.720
we'll come to that in a moment.

07:08.720 --> 07:15.080
And then, Sean Purney, "The Metaverse is the moment in time where our digital life is worth

07:15.080 --> 07:17.720
more than our physical life."

07:17.720 --> 07:30.520
I have to admit, if I was an outsider and I read all these things, it sounds like a word

07:30.520 --> 07:34.240
salad, to be honest.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.520
It doesn't sound very practical, it doesn't sound very real, it doesn't sound very here.

07:38.520 --> 07:44.360
We'll see how we think about this in a few more slides.

07:44.360 --> 07:52.000
Now in this section, I'm going to present three different Metaverse frameworks, how

07:52.000 --> 07:53.440
do I figure out a Metaverse?

07:53.440 --> 07:59.600
Two of which I stole from UNIC and one of which is my own.

07:59.600 --> 08:06.200
And so I'll do the UNIC ones that honor first and then I'll share mine.

08:06.200 --> 08:11.440
As usual, I don't think any of them are right and I don't think any of them are wrong.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.880
So, the Unichroto reported about the Metaverse for the European Union Blockchain Observatory

08:15.880 --> 08:24.720
and formed, and the team came up with a three-part framework.

08:24.720 --> 08:29.200
The first part is that it has universal impact.

08:29.200 --> 08:37.400
That a Metaverse, like other broadly adopted technologies and the internet, mobile phones

08:37.400 --> 08:41.440
and what have you, are universal in nature.

08:41.440 --> 08:45.000
They go across norms, disciplines, cultures, barriers.

08:45.000 --> 08:52.400
Some things you might think about is that some more specialized games, Metaverse, et cetera,

08:52.400 --> 08:57.640
might fail this first test of universality.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.800
The second test is persistence.

09:01.800 --> 09:07.320
I actually think this is important.

09:07.320 --> 09:13.680
So, here there's a you know, a cohesive and shared experience is created in your world.

09:13.680 --> 09:20.800
I think the mental model here is you leave and you come back and it's still there.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.600
It's not a firm rule.

09:22.600 --> 09:33.800
And the fire is adaptability, here defined as users can immerse themselves in a limited

09:33.800 --> 09:37.800
or significant way according to their individual needs.

09:37.800 --> 09:42.280
It's a reasonable framework to be honest.

09:42.280 --> 09:47.920
It's simple, it's straightforward, it's fairly conceptual.

09:47.920 --> 09:52.920
Let's put it as one mental model.

09:52.920 --> 09:57.920
Then we have a second framework that I call the "Giaglis Framework",

09:57.920 --> 09:59.360
George came up with it,

09:59.360 --> 10:03.120
he doesn't actually call it the Giaglis Framework.

10:03.120 --> 10:07.600
So, he's probably going to yell at me that I called it that in the presentation,

10:07.600 --> 10:14.760
but since he's the one who told it to me, I have put his name on it.

10:14.760 --> 10:23.080
And here is has six characteristics across two dimensions.

10:23.080 --> 10:28.920
And the dimensions one is technological in nature, one is governance in nature,

10:28.920 --> 10:31.640
and I think this is really interesting too.

10:31.640 --> 10:35.040
This is kind of more specific and more future looking, I think.

10:35.040 --> 10:42.880
And here the technology properties are photorealism, immersive as in persistence and what I call

10:42.880 --> 10:49.160
is the governance property, data ownership, openness and censorship resistance.

10:49.160 --> 11:05.160
And his view of this is not that more photorealism is good and less photorealism is bad or more

11:05.160 --> 11:17.920
photorealism is more Metaverse and less photorealism is less Metaverse and this applies for all of these variables or all these parameters,

11:17.920 --> 11:19.720
it's just a way to classify them.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.360
It's a way to say this Metaverse is photorealistic,

11:23.360 --> 11:25.840
this Metaverse is

11:25.840 --> 11:26.840
not photorealistic.

11:26.840 --> 11:35.960
And so, you start thinking about these as sliders or spectrums.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.400
So one spectrum is a photorealism,

11:38.400 --> 11:45.640
are we trying to replicate the visual model of the real world?

11:45.640 --> 11:52.680
Or as many games or social media or other possible universes don't look like the real

11:52.680 --> 11:54.000
world, at all?

11:54.000 --> 11:58.040
The second is immersiveness.

11:58.040 --> 12:08.440
How much are you in this world versus not in?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.440
What's the degree?

12:09.440 --> 12:14.360
You know, email is partially immersive.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.360
I sit at my laptop,

12:15.360 --> 12:16.360
I do things,

12:16.360 --> 12:24.320
I have my email client open, I go in and out,

12:24.320 --> 12:25.320
it pings me,

12:25.320 --> 12:26.320
This harasses a little bit.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.320


12:27.320 --> 12:28.320
I'm never totally out,

12:28.320 --> 12:30.320
I'm never totally in.

12:30.320 --> 12:35.440
If you're playing some first person shooter VR game with VR goggles, I'm only pretty

12:35.440 --> 12:36.440
immersed.

12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
You're not.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.000
You're not also.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.600
I can reply to emails and cook pasta.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.680
I can't play a VR game and cook pasta, right?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.760
So it's a level of immersiveness.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.360
Again, not that immersive is good or bad.

12:49.360 --> 12:52.360
It's just a slider.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.720
Persistence and here,

12:54.720 --> 13:00.560
George has a different definition of persistence than my earlier definition of persistence,

13:00.560 --> 13:04.640
which may end up right or

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
wrong.

13:05.640 --> 13:14.720
Is it always on?

13:14.720 --> 13:17.520
Does it follow you?

13:17.520 --> 13:18.520
Things to imagine.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.520
I'd say you had a virtual pet, right?

13:20.520 --> 13:21.520
It comes with you.

13:21.520 --> 13:22.520
It's there,

13:22.520 --> 13:29.800
it's persistent, which is somehow similar to, you can leave and come back and it's still

13:29.800 --> 13:34.960
there, that version of persistent, but it's a little bit different framework on.

13:34.960 --> 13:41.240
And then the governance properties are interesting.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.680
These are the types of topics that are exciting to me,

13:43.680 --> 13:46.840
we'll talk about them a few slides down as well.

13:46.840 --> 13:54.080
You know, data ownership, can users own the assets in the virtual world and can they

13:54.080 --> 13:57.720
take them out of the metaverse to another virtual world?

13:57.720 --> 14:02.520
It's interesting even hearing this definition.

14:02.520 --> 14:07.560
Someone might ask, what's the metaverse and what's the virtual world and why are they

14:07.560 --> 14:08.560
different?

14:08.560 --> 14:16.000
We'll come to this question of is metaverse singular and metaverse plural.

14:16.000 --> 14:22.880
Openness can developers or in my view, I think individuals, it doesn't have to be developers,

14:22.880 --> 14:32.720
Minecraft is, you don't need to be a developer to build things in Minecraft.

14:32.720 --> 14:40.440
And is the virtual world open to developers to create spaces, experiences, objects, applications?

14:40.440 --> 14:42.240
Is it customizable?

14:42.240 --> 14:50.480
And then the censorship resistance, so the degree to which users can be prohibited from

14:50.480 --> 14:55.160
accessing the virtual world restricted in their experiences or kicked off the metaverse

14:55.160 --> 14:58.800
by some centralized authority who owns or controls the world.

14:58.800 --> 15:03.600
Yeah, this is my personal obsession,

15:03.600 --> 15:10.720
arguably, I think today basically no metaverse is censorship resistant, and

15:10.720 --> 15:15.280
there's always a counterparty that is controlling it.

15:15.280 --> 15:25.240
I think this is an interesting and more practical framework for classifying metaverses or potential

15:25.240 --> 15:26.240
metaverses.

15:26.240 --> 15:33.600
And I think it's something that I don't assign work to anyone, but it could be, you could have this

15:33.600 --> 15:40.800
grid and put different metaverses in this grid and see where they fall out.

15:40.800 --> 15:50.080
Because I'm not advanced, I have a simpler definition of the metaverse, which is my framework

15:50.080 --> 15:54.360
on it, which is just one sentence.

15:54.360 --> 16:03.200
And my definition is, it is the internet with better visualization and persistent digital

16:03.200 --> 16:06.600
objects.

16:06.600 --> 16:23.320
And this is a quite different approach because I've kind of defined my way out of the singular

16:23.320 --> 16:31.320
or plural metaverse question and there's a reason for this.

16:31.320 --> 16:41.240
And I think my framework is going to be more relevant in the longer term.

16:41.240 --> 16:46.440
I think the other framework is great for today, but I think it's more relevant in the longer

16:46.440 --> 16:47.440
term.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.920
Why do I think that?

16:50.920 --> 16:59.760
Imagine any type of world where we have all these, let's call them "metaverse experiences".

16:59.760 --> 17:04.280
They're persistent, they're immersive, they may be photo realistic.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.440
They follow us around.

17:06.440 --> 17:12.000
They're probably AI enabled in many ways.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.160
There'll be multiple things, it won't just be one thing, I don't think it'll just be

17:16.160 --> 17:19.440
one metaverse and that metaverse is going to be Minecraft, right?

17:19.440 --> 17:28.280
Well, imagine that's the case and it's not today, it's 10 years from now or 15 years from

17:28.280 --> 17:32.440
now, or 20 years from now, it doesn't really matter when you pick.

17:32.440 --> 17:42.280
I don't think in that world we will have the metaverse and separately, the internet.

17:42.280 --> 17:47.880
I don't think you'll say, "oh, today I'm going to go use the internet and then later today

17:47.880 --> 17:50.640
I'm going to go use the metaverse".

17:50.640 --> 18:00.880
I think they're going to become the same thing, just like there was a time, maybe still true

18:00.880 --> 18:09.320
today, that like, mobile apps was a different thing, mobile was a different thing than desktop.

18:09.320 --> 18:16.640
I'm sure the phone factor is different, but I basically use more or less all the same

18:16.640 --> 18:25.440
applications on the desktop and on my phone and, I don't know if that's like some separate

18:25.440 --> 18:26.440
ecosystem.

18:26.440 --> 18:30.000
Or here's another way to think about it.

18:30.000 --> 18:35.440
Let's say you're in one of these, for argument's sake, three dimensional spaces.

18:35.440 --> 18:45.480
It isn't going to be the case that if you want to have extended conversations or chats

18:45.480 --> 18:50.360
with people in those spaces, you're going to leave them and go to some other chats

18:50.360 --> 18:53.280
offer.

18:53.280 --> 19:00.520
My guess is no, today the user experience, the user interface for having chats in these

19:00.520 --> 19:03.680
three spaces is kind of wonky.

19:03.680 --> 19:11.000
That's why I was still use Twitter and Discord and WhatsApp and Telegram and all these other

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
things, right?

19:12.000 --> 19:20.720
But the idea that again, a decade from now, we have this kind of persistent immersive

19:20.720 --> 19:30.000
environment and yet in order to chat to someone, in order to chat to someone, you have to

19:30.000 --> 19:34.800
leave it, and go somewhere else,

19:34.800 --> 19:35.800
makes no sense to me.

19:35.800 --> 19:41.040
If you're still, if it's a decade from now and you still have to leave the quote/unquote

19:41.040 --> 19:49.000
"metaverse" for me to send a DM to George, well, I mean, I don't think that metaverse will

19:49.000 --> 19:50.000
be very effective.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
Is that okay?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
Well, okay, fine.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
We'll have you.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.000
What about other things?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Email?

19:55.000 --> 19:57.760
You know, I'm sure we'll have email a decade from now

19:57.760 --> 20:02.680
but why can't I answer my email in that environment?

20:02.680 --> 20:07.880
It's just a form factor, a UX UI for reading my email,

20:07.880 --> 20:11.240
why can't I read my email in a private room?

20:11.240 --> 20:16.400
Why do I have to read it in the interface that it has now?

20:16.400 --> 20:17.400
Well, sure,

20:17.400 --> 20:18.400
Okay,

20:18.400 --> 20:20.880
but what about an old studio computer?

20:20.880 --> 20:23.640
I watch a movie,

20:23.640 --> 20:24.640
Okay,

20:24.640 --> 20:28.360
You can watch a movie in a three-year environment.

20:28.360 --> 20:32.680
I want to work on Excel.

20:32.680 --> 20:43.000
And in fact, you know, you could have, I assume by that point, you'll have much more screen

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
space to work with,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.200
you might have many Excels out there.

20:47.200 --> 20:58.200
So I just, I will be surprised if in the long run you go and spend a lot of time and some

20:58.200 --> 21:04.240
type of immersive environment and then you leave it to do all the other stuff you do

21:04.240 --> 21:05.240
now that's less immersive.

21:05.240 --> 21:14.160
To put it differently, I think the immersive environment can subsume the non-emersive environment.

21:14.160 --> 21:19.120
But I don't think the other way around works.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.840
You can have a 2D chat box in a 3D space.

21:22.840 --> 21:26.240
It's kind of hard to have a 3D space with a 2D chat box.

21:26.240 --> 21:35.600
And so if you believe in this, I just don't see any way it's not going to be like this

21:35.600 --> 21:41.440
then, the internet goes away.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.680
Now it doesn't go away,

21:42.680 --> 21:43.840
it's all right there.

21:43.840 --> 21:50.560
It's been the plumbing of how we communicate in a distance for many decades.

21:50.560 --> 21:57.360
But the idea that the internet and the metaverse are separate spaces, I think eventually ends.

21:57.360 --> 22:00.880
It's an open question I'm willing to concede,

22:00.880 --> 22:05.240
but I don't know when; is it in 10 years?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
Is it in 7?

22:07.240 --> 22:08.240
Is it in 23?

22:08.240 --> 22:17.040
But pick any arbitrary, arbitrary future point, 100 years from now.

22:17.040 --> 22:21.320
We have human brain interfaces.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.320
We don't even have physical devices.

22:23.320 --> 22:29.440
You're thinking about something and you're seeing it in front of you directly through

22:29.440 --> 22:30.440
your neurons.

22:30.440 --> 22:35.040
Are you really going to separately go use the internet somewhere else?

22:35.040 --> 22:37.040
I don't think so.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.040
I think they merge.

22:39.040 --> 22:40.040
And then they merge.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.800
It's just the internet that they merge.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.800
The metaverse is anyway running today on the internet.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.240
The metaverse space we're talking about is running on the internet.

22:49.240 --> 22:55.640
But what's the second pillar with better visualization?

22:55.640 --> 23:07.920
And this concept of better visualization is one that is a consistent theme in the internet

23:07.920 --> 23:09.160
since the day it started.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.920
It used to be touch-based.

23:10.920 --> 23:14.920
Then we got some pictures.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.600
Then we got really lousy video.

23:17.600 --> 23:23.240
An old enough term for when video was lousy on the internet.

23:23.240 --> 23:31.160
And today you can watch an HD movie on the internet.

23:31.160 --> 23:40.480
You can do a zoom and you have free global video conferencing on your laptop or even

23:40.480 --> 23:42.480
on your phone.

23:42.480 --> 23:48.480
Global video teleconference used to be a big company feature 15 years ago.

23:48.480 --> 23:52.760
You went to a special conference room to do that.

23:52.760 --> 23:56.480
And that's showing no sign of stopping.

23:56.480 --> 24:03.480
What I think is going to be the transition now is 3D visualization, the browser, the

24:03.480 --> 24:06.280
probably what is on the next side,

24:06.280 --> 24:13.280
and then augmented and virtual reality belong to them where they'll be together.

24:13.280 --> 24:21.000
I think once the devices get sufficiently functional, you'll have something like a pair

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
of sunglasses.

24:22.000 --> 24:26.400
Those pair of sunglasses will be mostly an awkward to reality.

24:26.400 --> 24:31.160
You'll also see the world around you, but also have digital objects there.

24:31.160 --> 24:37.200
See your fiddens on your wall or you'll have your Phoenix all spreadsheets floating around,

24:37.200 --> 24:42.720
but they'll have the ability to pop into virtual reality and hide the world around you.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.160
And that's going to come.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.440
It's not there yet.

24:48.440 --> 24:51.600
I know of no specific person,

24:51.600 --> 24:56.200
I'm sure there's some of the world's lessons, but I don't know any of them who wears a virtual

24:56.200 --> 24:57.200
reality headset all day.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.200
And there's a lot of excitement about the upcoming Apple augmented reality.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.720
I'd say maybe this will be a step forward and this is not going to work right every

25:05.720 --> 25:06.720
day.

25:06.720 --> 25:11.680
Every year we'll have a step forward where the devices will get more functional, more practical,

25:11.680 --> 25:17.120
and we will see this level of forwardness.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.040
I don't think we're there yet.

25:19.040 --> 25:24.160
I don't think it's like next year we're all going to be wearing AR and VR models.

25:24.160 --> 25:39.360
And then for persistence, I think of it about the digital objects.

25:39.360 --> 25:42.160
My mental models that will have persistent digital objects.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.160
Now what's a digital object?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.160
It'll be anything, right?

25:44.160 --> 25:47.200
It could be a piece of art.

25:47.200 --> 25:51.280
It could be an avatar.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.040
It could be a wearable.

25:54.040 --> 26:01.840
It could be a specific three dimensional space in which you do something.

26:01.840 --> 26:06.640
It could be a piece of "land".

26:06.640 --> 26:08.840
The land is different than a space, right?

26:08.840 --> 26:16.160
Land implies that there's some type of property that is surrounded by

26:16.160 --> 26:18.760
other property and you own a specific property.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.600
A space doesn't need to be the same as land, right?

26:21.600 --> 26:29.880
You can have a space that's not tied to some property grid.

26:29.880 --> 26:40.960
And my view of persistence is that they are there, when you come back.

26:40.960 --> 26:45.120
Now, where that open metaverse stuff?

26:45.120 --> 26:46.720
Well, it's not in the stuff initially.

26:46.720 --> 26:53.160
But to me as a definition, you could imagine closed metaverses fulfilling these conditions.

26:53.160 --> 26:57.120
And I think for the question over here, what's a metaverse?

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
That's fair.

26:58.120 --> 27:05.400
There's going to be closed metaverses and they might even win or partially win.

27:05.400 --> 27:13.840
So I don't think we can say that the definition of a metaverse by definition means it's open.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.400
It might be closed.

27:15.400 --> 27:20.040
We can think about what are the characteristics that make it open.

27:20.040 --> 27:23.880
But it's not like it's a short thing, but it's going to be open.

27:23.880 --> 27:32.240
But for me, these three things are the three main ones.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
They cover all scenarios.

27:34.240 --> 27:39.480
That is a less useful framework than say George's for classifying different metaverses

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
on different dimensions.

27:40.480 --> 27:51.200
But it also, I think, is it covers almost any possible inconsolable manner.

27:51.200 --> 27:58.880
I want to show an example here because I think people often, you say VR and AR, and this

27:58.880 --> 27:59.880
all cannot make sense.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.480
There is a 3D visualization browser.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.480
What do you mean?

28:03.480 --> 28:10.160
And this is a very silly example, but I think it illustrates the point.

28:10.160 --> 28:13.720
These are both screen grabs from the browser.

28:13.720 --> 28:24.760
And on the left is the website over the museum of modern art, a mobile that has the inventory

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
of everything at the moment.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.520
That is perfectly fine and functional
28:27.520 --> 28:35.680
and you can search by artist and you get this list of artwork.

28:35.680 --> 28:42.960
And on the right is the generative gallery of the 6529 museum, also running in

28:42.960 --> 28:43.960
the browser

28:43.960 --> 28:48.120
but one of them is 3D.

28:48.120 --> 28:55.880
And I think, over time, quite a few usage cases will migrate from the visualization on

28:55.880 --> 28:59.240
the left to the visualization on the right.

28:59.240 --> 29:05.920
Now, some things might stay on the visualization on the left for speed and ease of use

29:05.920 --> 29:11.920
and certainly we are not particularly ready to go to the right because they are still

29:11.920 --> 29:14.920
all of them are wonky.

29:14.920 --> 29:26.040
Even, do I think, oh, which is where this is on the right, is ready for prime time,

29:26.040 --> 29:30.200
retail, consumer use?

29:30.200 --> 29:34.480
That's okay, it's still early. Over the course of the next few years,

29:34.480 --> 29:42.320
we'll sort out how to make these spaces functional and fast and performant

29:42.320 --> 29:47.320
and people will figure out what is the model for moving around these spaces.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.160
Everyone now knows the model for working on the web.

29:51.160 --> 29:55.120
But it took a long time to sort that out.

29:55.120 --> 30:01.560
But I do think there are many usage cases where looking at something with this more expressive

30:01.560 --> 30:03.560
visualization has got to make sense.

30:03.560 --> 30:08.840
And as I was saying, you can put goggles on and go into VR into that gallery.

30:08.840 --> 30:09.840
Yeah, that's true.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.840
It can.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.080
But VR is there now.

30:13.080 --> 30:20.240
And so it's not, actually, don't think it's the rendering that's hugely the problem

30:20.240 --> 30:21.240
right now.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.240
I think it's the devices.

30:23.240 --> 30:27.680
Yes, that gallery, we can see it in VR

30:27.680 --> 30:29.680
and I've seen it once in VR.

30:29.680 --> 30:35.120
And every other time I went, I just went to the browser because I wasn't going to go

30:35.120 --> 30:39.440
get VR goggles and put them on just to go and insert something.

30:39.440 --> 30:44.840
So until that becomes easier, I think it's going to be mostly, most of the screen time

30:44.840 --> 30:52.040
is going to be in the browser not in VR and 3D on your browser or your computer, not

30:52.040 --> 30:53.040
in VR, we will get there in time,

30:53.040 --> 30:54.040
but not yet.

30:54.040 --> 31:07.840
Anybody definition raises a question, which is a general question of, is metaverse a

31:07.840 --> 31:08.840
singular or plural word?

31:08.840 --> 31:09.840


31:09.840 --> 31:10.840


31:10.840 --> 31:11.840

31:11.840 --> 31:25.840
And I'll say as always, I don't know.

31:25.840 --> 31:34.800
Nobody knows.

31:34.800 --> 31:54.840
But I will throw out a concept about how potentially, we can resolve it.

31:54.840 --> 32:03.560
And maybe the concept, which I think matters more, my definition is all unbiased, I think.

32:03.560 --> 32:11.760
My concept is that today they are plural and that some sufficiently far off time in the

32:11.760 --> 32:16.720
future, it's singular.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.720
Why are they plural today?

32:18.720 --> 32:27.600
Well, because today, metaverse spaces are a small fraction of the internet

32:27.600 --> 32:37.120
and so you kind of need the word to distinguish them from a regular website or a regular mobile

32:37.120 --> 32:38.120
application.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.520
It's very clear that not every website is a metaverse, right?

32:41.520 --> 32:45.360
And not every mobile application is a metaverse.

32:45.360 --> 32:57.440
And there is obviously more than one competing for this idea of being a metaverse.

32:57.440 --> 33:05.960
So I think today, it's sensibly a plural topic.

33:05.960 --> 33:15.520
If this is correct, but in the long run, the internet won't really be a different thing,

33:15.520 --> 33:24.160
I think in the long run, it's not going to make as much sense that they are plural, I

33:24.160 --> 33:25.160
think.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.680
I think the whole thing is going to just be metaverse.

33:27.680 --> 33:34.520
The way to think about it is, I don't know, imagine a kid growing up in 2040.

33:34.520 --> 33:45.000
You know, if you have spent any time around young kids today and you're a little bit older, like

33:45.000 --> 33:54.200
I am, it's a little bit disconcerting that they look at the TV as kind of being a subset

33:54.200 --> 33:56.800
of an iPad or something, right?

33:56.800 --> 34:02.520
A TV is a poorly functioning iPad,

34:02.520 --> 34:13.240
you can't do things on demand and, you know, I mean, linear TV, right?

34:13.240 --> 34:17.840
And then, you know, with smart TVs, you end up getting the YouTube and Netflix and whatever

34:17.840 --> 34:19.840
applications on them

34:19.840 --> 34:24.920
and so, they just become an iPad.

34:24.920 --> 34:32.040
The linear TV part of the TV is close to irrelevant.

34:32.040 --> 34:33.680
And that's weird,

34:33.680 --> 34:42.120
if you remember, like I remember, when TV was one thing and streaming video was something

34:42.120 --> 34:53.680
else, so you turn on TV and you watch on NBC, the Thanksgiving Day Parade, it's on NBC or it's

34:53.680 --> 34:54.680
on CBS, however

34:54.680 --> 34:58.720
tomorrow you'll turn on network TV and you'll watch the Thanksgiving Day Parade.

34:58.720 --> 35:05.280
And then you'd go to your computer, to the internet, and watch a YouTube video.

35:05.280 --> 35:15.800
And those were very distinct things and there were whole reports about internet video and

35:15.800 --> 35:22.680
video on demand and over the top video and I think those reports still exist, right?

35:22.680 --> 35:30.480
And if I look at older people, there's the most you watch a linear TV and you're going

35:30.480 --> 35:37.720
to get a little bit on their iPad or what have you and they're still very distinct.

35:37.720 --> 35:47.080
But if someone doesn't have the history and is starting you, the idea of telerestrials

35:47.080 --> 35:54.680
or cable or linear TV is absurd and irrelevant and stupid, right?

35:54.680 --> 36:01.000
It's all video and they're just different screens.

36:01.000 --> 36:09.840
I think very abstractly, very conceptually, that's how it's going to be.

36:09.840 --> 36:19.400
You know, once these metaverse spaces are performant and simple to use and in any case,

36:19.400 --> 36:22.840
I believe it's going to be easy to go from one to another, even in the closed case.

36:22.840 --> 36:29.720
I think it is going to be easy to go from one to another.

36:29.720 --> 36:40.600
Then someone who does not have the prior experience of a pre-metaverse internet, I think it's

36:40.600 --> 36:45.200
just going to be the one thing that you go and do things.

36:45.200 --> 36:47.200
I'm not specific applications there, right?

36:47.200 --> 36:50.200
And yeah, maybe the one by then is not going to be metaverse, right?

36:50.200 --> 36:51.360
Maybe there'll be something else.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.440
But I do think it's going to be unified in the end.

36:54.440 --> 37:02.720
I don't think it's going to be a bunch of different ones.

37:02.720 --> 37:10.240
Now, just conceptually here, we're not going to get into so much details on each one

37:10.240 --> 37:16.880
of these, but where were what might be the earliest metaverse?

37:16.880 --> 37:25.920
You know, multi-user versions were text-based and they had characters and you interacted

37:25.920 --> 37:26.920
with people.

37:26.920 --> 37:27.920
Immersive?

37:27.920 --> 37:42.160
Anyway, now on George's framework, not in the slightest but photo-realistic, but not

37:42.160 --> 37:43.160
necessarily relevant

37:43.160 --> 37:49.880
so we started here, right?

37:49.880 --> 37:53.080
And then we got some graphics.

37:53.080 --> 37:56.520
And shared, shared version, right?

37:56.520 --> 37:59.520
But then we got some better graphics.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.520
And a little bit more of a virtual world, right?

38:02.520 --> 38:06.320
This is all very early

38:06.320 --> 38:07.320
work.

38:07.320 --> 38:19.960
But I'm not sure they are conceptually different from us bouncing around and essential and

38:19.960 --> 38:21.840
or all know whatever now.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.840
How are they conceptually different?

38:23.840 --> 38:30.600
Is anything different other than the graphics are better?

38:30.600 --> 38:33.440
Is anything different other than the graphics are better,

38:33.440 --> 38:40.400
well, maybe now we have NFTs, which is a very specific topic, but for the metaverse aspect,

38:40.400 --> 38:49.200
I think the fundamental principles were already there in this year.

38:49.200 --> 38:59.360
And then I think the very obvious, you know, we come decades ahead.

38:59.360 --> 39:07.480
I think there's an excellent case that the massively multiplayer online role playing

39:07.480 --> 39:13.480
games are in the concept of plural metaverses, they're metaverses.

39:13.480 --> 39:25.440
A bit older, you enter a specific node, you have a specific role or character or avatar.

39:25.440 --> 39:36.200
There's persistence in some of these there are economies.

39:36.200 --> 39:44.280
I would credit them with being a metaverse research.

39:44.280 --> 39:49.000
Even our social layer metaverses have been doing it for a long time.

39:49.000 --> 40:00.520
Second life, very famously, got a lot of traction trying to build a metaverse in the

40:00.520 --> 40:01.520
2000s,

40:01.520 --> 40:04.520
it's been at least 10 years.

40:04.520 --> 40:12.520
I'm going to have to check exactly when it started.

40:12.520 --> 40:22.040
But it's been the same concepts as well there

40:22.040 --> 40:32.400
and a lot of the things we're seeing now with the blockchain based social virtual worlds

40:32.400 --> 40:38.040
existed then IBM is going to open a campus in Second Life.

40:38.040 --> 40:41.160
Some universities can open a campus in Second Life.

40:41.160 --> 40:47.440
Some retail stores are going to open a store in Second Life.

40:47.440 --> 40:49.360
We went through that cycle

40:49.360 --> 40:56.360
and it didn't totally quite stick with Second Life.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.960
Second Life is still up and running

40:58.960 --> 41:03.520
but it didn't take over the world the way.

41:03.520 --> 41:06.440
some people might have thought that it would.

41:06.440 --> 41:12.640
Here's another one.

41:12.640 --> 41:15.600
I ask myself this.

41:15.600 --> 41:22.480
Is NFT, Twitter and Discord a metaverse?

41:22.480 --> 41:29.080
Are those avatars or persistent digital objects?

41:29.080 --> 41:39.880
The world itself is persistent, my Twitter feed is persistent, my Discord feed is persistent.

41:39.880 --> 41:51.240
I come into them and I see the same type of people, characters, etc.

41:51.240 --> 41:56.920
There's definitely an economy.

41:56.920 --> 42:08.040
There is in fact a self-soverign economy because that economy primarily runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

42:08.040 --> 42:15.720
I'm thinking back to George's six factors.

42:15.720 --> 42:17.720
It's not photo-realistic.

42:17.720 --> 42:28.400
But OK maybe I'll it a little bit.

42:28.400 --> 42:34.360
Is NFT, Twitter and Discord and OpenSea and Oncyber and on-central and in some is this

42:34.360 --> 42:35.360
a metaverse?

42:35.360 --> 42:37.000
Sort of, I think.

42:37.000 --> 42:41.400
Is it fully polished and integrated?

42:41.400 --> 42:42.400
No.

42:42.400 --> 42:48.680
Is it a metaverse?

42:48.680 --> 42:49.680
I think.

42:49.680 --> 42:51.680
I think it is.

42:51.680 --> 42:59.880
And it's weird because here there's not one platform.

42:59.880 --> 43:13.600
Here what is to some degree serving as the unifying link is it there?

43:13.600 --> 43:20.680
And is it fully integrated that I signed Punk 6529 on Twitter and I signed Punk 6529

43:20.680 --> 43:21.680
on Discord?

43:21.680 --> 43:22.680
Why don't I sign on Discord?

43:22.680 --> 43:23.680
I could.

43:23.680 --> 43:24.680
I guess.

43:24.680 --> 43:25.680
Do it cloud-land.

43:25.680 --> 43:30.680
Do I Oncyber and on?

43:30.680 --> 43:32.880
Yeah, I do.

43:32.880 --> 43:40.640
And so, it feels to me that this is one a relatively more decentralized metaverse or relatively

43:40.640 --> 43:47.680
where the layer that ties people together imperfectly today.

43:47.680 --> 43:56.480
And with a lot of noise, not full signal, a lot of noise, is the Ethereum option?

43:56.480 --> 43:59.560
What's some other examples?

43:59.560 --> 44:01.560
What can I go?

44:01.560 --> 44:02.560
Okay.

44:02.560 --> 44:03.560
I'm just a parent.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.560
Does it have some metaverse characteristic?

44:05.560 --> 44:06.560
Yeah, it's persistent.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.560
Is there a community?

44:07.560 --> 44:08.560
Yeah.

44:08.560 --> 44:09.560
Is it a game?

44:09.560 --> 44:10.560
I don't know

44:10.560 --> 44:13.560
ask this question in a couple of seconds.

44:13.560 --> 44:24.680
Where is the line between any multiplayer game, and I also need this for the massively

44:24.680 --> 44:32.040
multiplayer online games, and Pokemon Go?

44:32.040 --> 44:34.080
Are the games or are the metaverse?

44:34.080 --> 44:36.440
I don't know.

44:36.440 --> 44:40.520
Is every game a metaverse?

44:40.520 --> 44:45.480
Does that just mean all games are metaverses?

44:45.480 --> 44:52.640
It feels like it diminishes the term of it.

44:52.640 --> 45:02.640
Also I feel like it diminishes the concept of metaverses, plural.

45:02.640 --> 45:15.160
Because you can't, there's no obvious stopping point on the point on when it's no longer a metaverse.

45:15.160 --> 45:28.640
So it's why my mental model often goes to someday it's just going to be metaverse singular.

45:28.640 --> 45:38.000
And then you don't have to have these highly theoretical discussions of is this a game, or

45:38.000 --> 45:39.000
is this a metaverse?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Is this a virtual world?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.000
Is this a metaverse?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.920
Is this social media or is it a metaverse?

45:43.920 --> 45:52.480
Seems unhelpful, not particularly clear.

45:52.480 --> 45:57.120
And things that are unhelpful, frameworks are unhelpful and not particularly clear and don't

45:57.120 --> 46:04.480
drive any particular changes in behavior possibly might be not perfectly fine-tuned to the

46:04.480 --> 46:08.280
environment.

46:08.280 --> 46:14.960
Then we have the ones in our spaces, you know, the central and crypto console, some in other

46:14.960 --> 46:24.720
side, all of these that tend to be NFT based for the land assets.

46:24.720 --> 46:32.920
We do tend to have a centralized rendering delivery system.

46:32.920 --> 46:40.280
We'll talk about that in the very last session of the course.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.320
Here's my game slide.

46:42.320 --> 46:45.520
Is it a game or is it a metaverse?

46:45.520 --> 46:46.840
It doesn't matter.

46:46.840 --> 46:47.840
Right?

46:47.840 --> 46:54.840
Does that mean none of these things matter?

46:54.840 --> 47:00.120
Instead of fighting what exactly is or isn't a metaverse,

47:00.120 --> 47:05.920
if you go to the generic definition that it is, the internet with better visualization

47:05.920 --> 47:11.840
and persistent digital objects starts to get interesting.

47:11.840 --> 47:17.680
You sidestep all these questions.

47:17.680 --> 47:20.360
Let's talk about openness for a second.

47:20.360 --> 47:23.920
We'll talk about a lot more in session 12.

47:23.920 --> 47:28.280
That's why I haven't got into great detail here

47:28.280 --> 47:37.560
but I think it is useful to at least touch upon it a little bit.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.440
All of these are versions of openness.

47:40.440 --> 47:45.600
Some of them more open than others, I think.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.160
Let's start at the top.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.160
Interoperability.

47:49.160 --> 47:55.240
All of the big closed metaverses are going to talk about this.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.240
Why?

47:56.240 --> 48:03.320
Because partially for PR reasons, regulators like interoperability, and so

48:03.320 --> 48:10.560
nobody is going to come say, I don't want to be interoperable with others.

48:10.560 --> 48:16.880
There are also cases where interoperability helps the big guys because they can absorb

48:16.880 --> 48:18.880
other users.

48:18.880 --> 48:29.280
And so expect from the big closed platforms, none of them are going to say that they're

48:29.280 --> 48:30.280
closed.

48:30.280 --> 48:39.360
What they're going to say is "we are absolutely in favor of interoperability".

48:39.360 --> 48:46.160
That interoperability, of course, is going to be driven through closed systems and some

48:46.160 --> 48:49.200
interaction models with closed systems.

48:49.200 --> 48:57.040
And usually what happens in this case is there's a game to make it easy to come into

48:57.040 --> 49:08.840
your world or application or what have you, and make it hard or inconvenient to leave.

49:08.840 --> 49:21.480
This is usually how people deal with interoperability.

49:21.480 --> 49:26.840
Let's say that is the absolute bottom layer of openness.

49:26.840 --> 49:37.040
Let's say the next layer, which is where most of the activity today is in the space.

49:37.040 --> 49:43.920
This is like a kind of five step model.

49:43.920 --> 49:47.760
A lot of people say, yeah, no, all your digital objects.

49:47.760 --> 49:54.040
Your land in, fill-in-the-bank is an NFT.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.040
We can't take it from you.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.880
So that's good.

49:57.880 --> 50:02.320
It's certainly better and from my opinion, better than the alternative.

50:02.320 --> 50:11.040
But also, this usually comes with a bunch of terms and conditions.

50:11.040 --> 50:16.080
If you want to play this object in our world, you got to do these things or we can kick

50:16.080 --> 50:21.520
you out, which is different than saying, you know, Bitcoin.

50:21.520 --> 50:27.040
Bitcoin does not come with terms and conditions like Bitcoin.

50:27.040 --> 50:32.720
No one can kick you out of the Bitcoin world.

50:32.720 --> 50:33.720
Next topic.

50:33.720 --> 50:34.720
Governance models.

50:34.720 --> 50:37.720
Is someone in charge?

50:37.720 --> 50:43.640
Some of the metaverse NFT/metaverse platforms, games, etc.

50:43.640 --> 50:47.520
It's very clear there's a company in charge.

50:47.520 --> 50:53.680
They make the decisions and you play as a customer in effect.

50:53.680 --> 51:04.080
Some others have some form of partially decentralized governments where different districts can

51:04.080 --> 51:13.320
make decisions for themselves, but they do still, I think, fall within broader top-level

51:13.320 --> 51:16.960
governments.

51:16.960 --> 51:17.960
Next topic, what's the client?

51:17.960 --> 51:22.880
You know, what's the client and what's the server, do the client and the server go together?

51:22.880 --> 51:28.040
You know, some folks are trying to do open the Web3 types of servers, what we need in

51:28.040 --> 51:29.040
the browser.

51:29.040 --> 51:32.880
There's a some downsides, you know, that infrastructure is more developed to doing it

51:32.880 --> 51:36.280
with one of the gaming platforms

51:36.280 --> 51:43.880
but browsers are more open

51:43.880 --> 51:46.880
as a endpoint.

51:46.880 --> 51:53.880
I think nobody has right now, there's multiple rendering environments.

51:53.880 --> 52:04.400
Like on all these, you have to go, even the ones who have open clients and ownership of

52:04.400 --> 52:16.480
digital objects as NFTs, there's still a form of interoperability as opposed to being

52:16.480 --> 52:19.480
fully decentralized and open

52:19.480 --> 52:23.480
and if it's fully decentralized and open, again, the rental model is Bitcoin; anyone can run

52:23.480 --> 52:32.480
a Bitcoin client, anyone can run a Bitcoin miner, you don't have to go to Bitcoin.com to

52:32.480 --> 52:34.480
do something.

52:34.480 --> 52:45.440
Today, every one of the platforms, you have to go to a platform-name.com or.io to run

52:45.440 --> 52:46.440
a Bitcoin miner.

52:46.440 --> 52:48.440
It is a point of centralization.

52:48.440 --> 52:51.440
It's a point of not censorship-resistant.

52:51.440 --> 52:56.440
Everything we've got in the whole sale, I can't get one, but you can take them and rebuild

52:56.440 --> 52:58.440
them somewhere else, and yeah, that's fine.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.440
But that's some more interoperability.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.440
It's the last...

53:03.440 --> 53:07.440
What I'd like to see, or I'd like to get to it, is I might not get to, which is why I'm

53:07.440 --> 53:10.440
not saying all of these things yet, because it's not.

53:10.440 --> 53:12.440
I hope to get them.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.440
It's not today.

53:14.440 --> 53:20.440
So, is that anyone can do any of these things?

53:20.440 --> 53:22.440
Like the Internet.

53:22.440 --> 53:29.440
There is not one place you can have a website.

53:29.440 --> 53:37.440
Even if it's on popular website, confidential systems, WordPress, there's not one place

53:37.440 --> 53:39.440
where you can run WordPress.

53:39.440 --> 53:45.440
You can host your site on WordPress.org.

53:45.440 --> 53:53.440
But if you also download WordPress Self-Reserving chosen, you can run the WordPress software

53:53.440 --> 53:54.440
by yourself.

53:54.440 --> 53:58.440
You don't need anyone's permission to do this.

53:58.440 --> 54:04.440
There is no global governance governing one WordPress site.

54:04.440 --> 54:08.440
There's not one company that owns all the WordPress sites.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.440
It's all right.

54:10.440 --> 54:15.440
And this is, I guess, metaverse is going to be exactly WordPress? No, but it's a useful

54:15.440 --> 54:16.440
example to think about.

54:16.440 --> 54:19.440
Are there centralized companies that are built on top of WordPress? Sure

54:19.440 --> 54:22.440
Are some of them variable?

54:22.440 --> 54:23.440
Sure.

54:23.440 --> 54:25.440
Is WordPress centralized?

54:25.440 --> 54:27.440
No, it's not.

54:27.440 --> 54:28.440
It's open.

54:28.440 --> 54:29.440
It's decentralized.

54:29.440 --> 54:37.440
So, I think these are things we'll talk about more in four weeks, but I do want to, like,

54:37.440 --> 54:40.440
introduce them to the discussion.

54:40.440 --> 55:04.440
Now, let me pause there because I'm on one hour and three minutes.

55:04.440 --> 55:12.440
So, we'll switch to questions.

55:12.440 --> 55:20.440
But I do think the three big takeaways, I would say, the is a new found interest in the

55:20.440 --> 55:21.440
metaverse.

55:21.440 --> 55:28.440
Anyways, multiple potential frameworks on what THE metaverse or A metaverse is,

55:28.440 --> 55:31.440
and there's multiple different candidates over the years of things that could have been

55:31.440 --> 55:34.440
or might have been metaverses.

55:34.440 --> 55:40.440
And I think all of these are works in progress and a space where I think it's going to evolve

55:40.440 --> 55:41.440
very quickly.

55:41.440 --> 55:46.440
In five, ten, fifteen, twenty years, we're going to have a different framework on these

55:46.440 --> 55:47.440
topics.

55:47.440 --> 55:55.440
So, let me open up my chat so I can see

55:55.440 --> 56:02.440
and then I'll switch to questions.

56:25.440 --> 56:28.440

56:28.440 --> 56:31.440

56:31.440 --> 56:34.440

56:34.440 --> 56:38.440

56:38.440 --> 56:46.440

56:46.440 --> 57:04.440

57:04.440 --> 57:05.440
Okay.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.440
First question.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.440
"Why doesn't your definition include decentralized platforms?

57:09.440 --> 57:11.440
It's so important."

57:11.440 --> 57:13.440
Yeah, I agree.

57:13.440 --> 57:22.440
I'm running around, tweeting all day long about the open metaverse.

57:22.440 --> 57:29.440
But I need to be in touch and honest in this presentation because it is perfectly possible

57:29.440 --> 57:36.440
that the open metaverse doesn't happen.

57:36.440 --> 57:44.440
I hope that's not the case.

57:44.440 --> 57:49.440
I'm spending an infinite amount of time hoping it does happen.

57:49.440 --> 57:53.440
But the metaverse could exist

57:53.440 --> 57:56.440
that is closed.

57:56.440 --> 57:59.440
And I think it would still be a metaverse.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.440
It would be a closed metaverse.

58:01.440 --> 58:03.440
I'd be less happy about it, but there is no reason why it couldn't exist


58:03.440 --> 58:10.440
So, me, as 6529 believe in open metaverse.

58:10.440 --> 58:18.440
Me as someone running your presentation on what a metaverse is, I don't think it is by definition

58:18.440 --> 58:19.440
decentralized.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.440
An open metaverse might be.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.440
Right?

58:22.440 --> 58:26.440
That's why I added the slide on open.

58:26.440 --> 58:33.440
"The Giaglis Framework seems to bridge metaverse with a Web3 ethos.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.440
Is that the intention?

58:35.440 --> 58:37.440
Because not all visions of the metaverse do this."

58:37.440 --> 58:40.440
Yeah, now I noticed that when I read it.

58:40.440 --> 58:46.440
George is a crypto person, has been for a very long time.

58:46.440 --> 58:49.440
And so,

58:49.440 --> 58:56.440
I am not surprised that there is a Web3 ethos embedded in his metaverse framework.

58:56.440 --> 59:04.440
And I think a lot of people who do not come from this Web3/Crypto aspect 

59:04.440 --> 59:19.440
do not include those parameters at all

59:19.440 --> 59:26.440
So, I'm glad he has included them.

59:26.440 --> 59:36.440
Does the 6529 framework believe they will be connected?

59:36.440 --> 59:37.440
Well, I hope so.

59:37.440 --> 59:41.440
I hope the basis, I'm parking this until week 12

59:41.440 --> 59:44.440
because week 12, I'm going to be a little bit more personal.

59:44.440 --> 59:49.440
And a week eight, I'm trying to be a little bit more neutral

59:49.440 --> 59:50.440
I guess.

59:50.440 --> 59:58.440
My view is that we

59:58.440 --> 00:02.440
have a mechanism to make them interoperable.

00:02.440 --> 00:06.440
and that mechanism is a kind of tease.

00:06.440 --> 00:15.440
And instead of having some large organizations decide on interoperability standards,

00:15.440 --> 00:21.440
but fundamentally work in closed

00:21.440 --> 00:27.440
environments.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.440


00:32.440 --> 00:36.440
NFTs are fundamentally open environment

00:36.440 --> 00:38.440
and then people can build on top of them

00:38.440 --> 00:40.440
but I want to talk about that in the week 12.

00:40.440 --> 00:45.440
There were heading away from.

00:45.440 --> 00:48.440
An objective understanding of the situation to my personal belief

00:48.440 --> 00:52.440
on what would be better.

00:52.440 --> 00:55.440
"What is the overlap between the concepts of metaverse and cryptocurrency?"

00:55.440 --> 01:01.440
Well, if you want a

01:01.440 --> 01:03.440
closed metaverse, you don't need any.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.440
You can run a close metaverse where

01:05.440 --> 01:10.440
people own the game objects, but in

01:10.440 --> 01:14.440
Epic's database, people can pay for them with credits in

01:14.440 --> 01:17.440
Epic's database.

01:17.440 --> 01:24.440


01:24.440 --> 01:28.440

01:28.440 --> 01:31.440
A lot of companies are going to do that, to be honest.

01:31.440 --> 01:35.440
So,

01:35.440 --> 01:37.440
if you want an open

01:37.440 --> 01:39.440
metaverse

01:39.440 --> 01:46.440
with not one party in charge with not one person's database in charge.

01:46.440 --> 01:57.440
Well, then you need something that's on a database and that's really a blockchain and specifically a public blockchain, which is what we call a cryptocurrency or crypto asset.

01:57.440 --> 02:02.440
So, that is a good question.

02:02.440 --> 02:08.440
I thought there was a social aspect to the metaverse versus just the 3D space, but it wasn't included in the definitions.

02:08.440 --> 02:11.440
This is a very good point

02:11.440 --> 02:15.440
and we need to think about it.

02:15.440 --> 02:20.440
That needs to get on the slide somewhere.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.440
Yeah, for sure

02:22.440 --> 02:23.440
there's a social aspect

02:23.440 --> 02:26.440
and it's kind of implicitly there

02:26.440 --> 02:28.440
and it should be made explicitly there,

02:28.440 --> 02:34.440
I mean, one mental model that I sometimes have 

02:34.440 --> 02:36.440
are

02:36.440 --> 02:43.440
metaverses just social networks

02:43.440 --> 02:46.440
with just different visualizations.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.440
But overall, those are social networks.

02:49.440 --> 02:58.440
I don't know.

02:58.440 --> 03:03.440
But we need to put a slide in there, which says this

03:03.440 --> 03:06.440
explicitly.

03:06.440 --> 03:17.440
High risk that large companies get to set the rules for metaverse, is that a threat or a possibility in your opinion. Yes, in fact, the whole reason 6529 exists is that I think that

03:17.440 --> 03:19.440
that is a very high risk.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.440
I think that is the default case.

03:21.440 --> 03:25.440
I think the default case is that

03:25.440 --> 03:32.440
metaverses will become like Web2, they will be centralized in 5, 10, 15, 20 companies

03:32.440 --> 03:34.440
and I think that's about outcome,

03:34.440 --> 03:45.440
and that's my personal opinion. I don't think that's an objective view about the metaverse someone might have. Someone from Meta might think it's better not to be that way.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.440
I mean, to be that way, but,

03:48.440 --> 03:51.440
for sure I think it's worse.

03:51.440 --> 04:03.440
"Do you believe in a future of the concept of land and gravity in metaverse? To me, they seem like artificial limitations of limit the entry barrier as people are familiar with

04:03.440 --> 04:06.440
these concepts."

04:06.440 --> 04:15.440
Well, I mean,

04:15.440 --> 04:23.440
I hear this fairly often.

04:23.440 --> 04:33.440
From people who are

04:33.440 --> 04:35.440
very deep into the space.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.440
And as hell these things are just total skill morphism.

04:39.440 --> 04:42.440
They're limitations.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.440
We don't need to stick to the land concept.

04:45.440 --> 04:50.440
We don't need to stick to the human scale concept.

04:50.440 --> 04:58.440
And I appreciate that in theory

04:58.440 --> 05:01.440
now, without a counter argument

05:01.440 --> 05:04.440
which is the following.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.440
The counter argument is,

05:07.440 --> 05:14.440
almost we've been making video games for several decades now

05:14.440 --> 05:20.440
a,nd those video games

05:20.440 --> 05:22.440
have been

05:22.440 --> 05:25.440
overwhelmingly

05:25.440 --> 05:28.440


05:28.440 --> 05:46.440
skeuomorphic with land and gravity and things of that nature.

05:46.440 --> 05:59.440
I think there is something to that,

05:59.440 --> 06:07.440
I don't think it's accidental

06:07.440 --> 06:17.440
that almost all games match these types of models. I don't think it's an accident.

06:17.440 --> 06:22.440
I also have

06:22.440 --> 06:28.440
seen attempts to make hugely conceptual spaces

06:28.440 --> 06:31.440
and every attempt I've seen so far,

06:31.440 --> 06:34.440
has been kind of junk.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.440
Now, maybe the space is really good, but the problem is like

06:37.440 --> 06:40.440
our mental models are stuck on

06:40.440 --> 06:43.440
things looking a little bit like the real world.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.440
Maybe.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.440
But it's kind of six and one and a half dozen of the other.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
It's.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.440


06:58.440 --> 07:02.440
I have yet to see one where it works.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.440
So in theory,

07:04.440 --> 07:08.440
yes, these are official limitations and we can do whatever we want,

07:08.440 --> 07:09.440
and practice,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.440
whatever we want.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.440
So far has ended up looking

07:13.440 --> 07:15.440
kind of like the real world.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.440
Now, not exactly like the real world but,

07:16.440 --> 07:19.440
there's gravity in home, for example, but not a lot of gravity,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
you can jump really high.

07:21.440 --> 07:27.440
So

07:27.440 --> 07:33.440
to prove it otherwise,

07:33.440 --> 07:37.440
I would expect most things will somehow correlate with real world 

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
concepts.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.440
"Thoughts on digital twins using the metaverse."

07:40.440 --> 07:44.440
So digital twins are a digital representation of something in the

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
physical world,

07:45.440 --> 07:48.440
and they came out of the world of like

07:48.440 --> 07:51.440
high end equipment manufacturing and so on.

07:51.440 --> 07:55.440
And so you have like a turbine and you make a physical copy of the turbine and

07:55.440 --> 07:58.440
you put on the physical turbine sensors

07:58.440 --> 08:02.440
and those sensors feed data to the digital twin

08:02.440 --> 08:05.440
and so you can watch and monitor,

08:05.440 --> 08:07.440
the

08:07.440 --> 08:09.440
turbine

08:09.440 --> 08:11.440
during

08:11.440 --> 08:13.440
In the digital world.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.440
And you know

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
say, oh, look, there's

08:16.440 --> 08:17.440
data is coming out of line,

08:17.440 --> 08:19.440
the turbines are not behaving normally,

08:19.440 --> 08:22.440
let's go fix it in the physical world before it breaks.

08:22.440 --> 08:23.440
Now there's other use cases too

08:23.440 --> 08:27.440
I think in time you'll have cities where you'll see full in some

08:27.440 --> 08:30.440
cities, there are cities with digital twins, but they'll get better where

08:30.440 --> 08:35.440
you'll say, look, we're monitoring traffic flows and pollution and waste

08:35.440 --> 08:38.440
water and disease spread.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.440
Absolutely is going to exist

08:41.440 --> 08:46.440
I think for

08:46.440 --> 08:48.440
kind of boring

08:48.440 --> 08:54.440
I'm sorry, not boring, what is the word I'm looking for.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.440
Institutional use.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.440
Not like hanging out fun social use actually think digital twins are going

08:59.440 --> 09:01.440
to be very important

09:01.440 --> 09:04.440
because they will give us

09:04.440 --> 09:07.440
a viable

09:07.440 --> 09:10.440
model

09:10.440 --> 09:13.440
to improve the real world and monitor the real world better.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.440
So I'm fairly bullish on these as a concept

09:15.440 --> 09:18.440
I can't an architecture.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.440
How do we protect these from being copied?

09:20.440 --> 09:25.440
I don't think it's easy to be honest.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.440
Just like anything else on the Internet,

09:27.440 --> 09:30.440
how do you protect them from being copied?

09:30.440 --> 09:32.440
Not that easily.

09:32.440 --> 09:35.440
So what do you have to aim for?

09:35.440 --> 09:37.440
Well, the same,

09:37.440 --> 09:40.440
I mean, it's a version of right click.

09:40.440 --> 09:48.440
And so you're going to have to have some concept of

09:48.440 --> 09:51.440
providence

09:51.440 --> 09:55.440
for that

09:55.440 --> 09:58.440

09:58.440 --> 10:01.440
not to be a big issue.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.440
But I do think like, if you make a cool looking building somewhere

10:05.440 --> 10:07.440
might someone copy it somewhere else?

10:07.440 --> 10:11.440
yeah, I think that one comes.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.440
I don't see it obviously for it not to happen

10:15.440 --> 10:21.440
so I think given what we've learned from NFTs,

10:21.440 --> 10:23.440
if

10:23.440 --> 10:27.440
X copy makes some cool X copy building

10:27.440 --> 10:31.440
and there are 1000 tokens of that X copy building

10:31.440 --> 10:36.440
and 

10:36.440 --> 10:40.440
you own one of those,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.440
that's going to be different

10:42.440 --> 10:47.440
and more valuable than someone who just right clicked saved your X copy building.

10:47.440 --> 10:56.440
So I suspect we're going to have to use the same frameworks and mental models that we use for digital art for digital buildings.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.440
I don't see any other

10:58.440 --> 11:01.440
way around it.

11:01.440 --> 11:09.440
You want provenance and tokenization

11:09.440 --> 11:15.440
to manage this topic.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.440
There's a question that I don't have about the slightest idea what it means

11:19.440 --> 11:22.440
or how to answer it but I'm going to read it because it's amuzing.

11:22.440 --> 11:28.440
"Is a metaverse a way of function with multiple potentials with collapsing one through observation?

11:28.440 --> 11:34.440
I think quantum computers will drastically change the metaverse definitions."

11:34.440 --> 11:38.440
I kind of understand the words

11:38.440 --> 11:41.440
and sort of the concepts behind this

11:41.440 --> 11:44.440
I just don't have any idea how to answer this question.

11:44.440 --> 11:47.440
So I didn't think it would be hard to read it for everyone

11:47.440 --> 11:52.440
in case it's helpful for anyone else.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.440
"What's the best book you've read about constructs?"

11:55.440 --> 11:58.440
I mean the classic book on this right is Snow Crash,

11:58.440 --> 12:03.440
everyone starts there.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.440
Actually I think a book that people don't think of as directly being a metaverse book.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.440
It is kind of a metaverse book.

12:12.440 --> 12:22.440
A mixed reality metaverse book is the series of

12:22.440 --> 12:32.440
Demon and Freedom.

12:32.440 --> 12:37.440
So,

12:37.440 --> 12:42.440
it's interesting because it's basically a gaming platform.

12:42.440 --> 12:47.440
Like wild and started.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.440
Impacting behavior in the real world,

12:50.440 --> 12:55.440
and it is a form of metaverse,

12:55.440 --> 12:59.440
I think.

12:59.440 --> 13:02.440
A kind of an abstract form of metaverse like some of these ones we're talking about

13:02.440 --> 13:09.440
so I threw it out there not because it's...

13:09.440 --> 13:12.440
it's not a classic book of the genre

13:12.440 --> 13:18.440
but I think there's a mental model that you could view it there and I find it's interesting.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.440
"Aren't you afraid that the metaverse will become a trap?  

13:21.440 --> 13:24.440
A.I. and robotics throw us from offices

13:24.440 --> 13:26.440
there'll be nothing to do.

13:26.440 --> 13:31.440
The metaverse can be such a golden cage to socialize and entertain us."

13:31.440 --> 13:35.440
Well, I mean

13:35.440 --> 13:38.440
I'm not sure I believe the premises of this question.

13:38.440 --> 13:45.440
But, if A.I. and robotics start doing all the work for us,

13:45.440 --> 13:50.440
we probably will hang out in the metaverse more.

13:50.440 --> 13:54.440
I know this question is written with a value judgment in it.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.440
But,

13:56.440 --> 13:59.440
maybe the value judgment is opposite.

13:59.440 --> 14:02.440
Maybe if the machines do all of our

14:02.440 --> 14:04.440
work for us

14:04.440 --> 14:09.440
we can be the people focused on

14:09.440 --> 14:12.440
self development and self expression.

14:12.440 --> 14:15.440
I'm a little skeptical of how that will play out.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.440
It hasn't played out and I'm

14:18.440 --> 14:23.440
actually not sure it's super healthy for humans not to have challenges

14:23.440 --> 14:27.440
so I don't know if it's going to play out that way.

14:27.440 --> 14:35.440
But yeah, I mean conceivably in the world that the A.I.s are good enough to do all our work,

14:35.440 --> 14:40.440
but not good enough to get rid of us,

14:40.440 --> 14:44.440
will we keep ourselves, or to frame it differently,

14:44.440 --> 14:49.440
keep ourselves more occupied with social activities from people around the world?

14:49.440 --> 14:51.440
Sure.

14:51.440 --> 14:53.440
Is that metaverse a golden cage?

14:53.440 --> 14:54.440
Maybe

14:54.440 --> 14:56.440
but like

14:56.440 --> 15:01.440
I don't know if there's any more of a golden cage than Twitter is today.

15:01.440 --> 15:03.440
And some people say, oh, putters not.

15:03.440 --> 15:08.440
It's taking people away from real life.

15:08.440 --> 15:15.440

15:15.440 --> 15:25.440

15:25.440 --> 15:30.440
Do you see our visual one largely the same as we come up on a year of their deal?

15:30.440 --> 15:31.440
Yeah

15:31.440 --> 15:32.440
more or less exactly the same

15:32.440 --> 15:34.440
I'll talk about it more in week 12

15:34.440 --> 15:39.440
and I want to make the session more general.

15:39.440 --> 15:44.440
Okay, I think we're an hour and a half.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.440
Let's wrap it here.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.440
Thank you as always for joining.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.440
We'll make the announcements in a little bit about

15:52.440 --> 15:57.440
regional and course logistics a little bit so we can start getting the guests back and coming.

15:57.440 --> 16:03.440
There's just an awful lot going on and the teams are doing a great job

16:03.440 --> 16:04.440
working on things.

16:04.440 --> 16:09.440
So we're just going to give ourselves a little bit more breathing room to get everything done.

16:09.440 --> 16:11.440
Can anyone build them on the other?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
You need to.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.440
Can anyone can use a space and put NFT's in it.

16:15.440 --> 16:18.440
If you want to design spaces, you do need some

16:18.440 --> 16:22.440
experience and 3D modeling, but if you have that, yes, you can do that.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.440
All right, everyone.

16:24.440 --> 16:27.440
Thank you so much as always.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.440
And I'll see you back on Twitter.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.440
Sure.
