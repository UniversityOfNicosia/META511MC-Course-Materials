1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,720
All right.

2
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,240
Hello everyone and welcome back for today's Metaverse Panel.

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,160
As you learn, it is hopefully people have found the right location.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,080
We are not in quote unquote sector zero today.

5
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:36,400
We're on the very very beginnings of the Metaverse camp.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:42,600
There's a big amphitheater and an outdoor park course that people jump around on.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,600
We don't have classrooms or auditoriums or other things yet.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,600
We do have a nice place to pick around.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Today we're joined with three important builders broadly, or I would call in the Metaverse ecosystem.

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:08,840
What we're going to do today is learn what they're doing, ask them easier or harder questions

11
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,440
as they know, and then find out what our future is going to look like.

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,200
As it's not just what's going to happen this year, I'd like to know what's going to happen

13
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:30,200
in 2035 so I can get mentally prepared for launching myself into the Metaverse.

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,720
The interesting here are the points of view of this week.

15
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,680
Then as always, at the end we will have some time for questions from the audience.

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:52,680
By all means keep track of what you'd like to ask and we'll cover it at the end.

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,280
Before we get into specifics, I think it is important that we give our guests the opportunity

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
to properly introduce themselves.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,520
They are all three very interesting people.

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,040
The backgrounds and they are working on interesting projects.

21
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:14,280
We're going to go through one by one, learn a little bit about how they ended up here

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,200
working on these cutting edge topics and what specifically they're working on right now.

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,960
We'll do that and we'll get to the questions.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,120
Let's start with the first.

25
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,440
Great to be here.

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Thanks for having me.

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,520
A little on my background.

28
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm Charlie.

29
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,440
I'm the founder of Restless and Charlie Cohen fashion brand.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,720
I started the Charlie Cohen brand back in 2012.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,960
Although it was a physical fashion brand, everything was very much based around internet

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
culture.

33
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,880
Throughout my fashion degree, which had been the prior four years, I was very involved

34
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,640
as a blogger and involved in a lot of digital discourse.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,800
I was well aware by that time that my digital identity was as valuable, if not more valuable,

36
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,120
to me than my physical identity.

37
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,760
It was something that I really wanted to bring into physical collections.

38
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,360
Whether that was certain activations around each collection, what kind of platforms we

39
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,480
could build for having a conversation around the themes for each collection, plugging into

40
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,960
meme culture and so on.

41
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,480
Then after a couple of years, I'd say around 2015, we started getting to experiment with

42
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,960
AR and BR as well and being able to take this digital storytelling to another level and

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,600
really start creating alternative experiences to traditional fashion events like fashion

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,360
weeks, like typical lookbook shoots and so on.

45
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,320
It was a much more interesting way to connect with our community, who very much weren't

46
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,360
at these shows on the traditional fashion calendar.

47
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,920
2019, we started getting to work with the gaming industry.

48
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:04,440
That was really the first time I got deep into designing digital wearables and having

49
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,240
digital physical crossover.

50
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:11,520
Going into 2020, we were in a great position for the pandemic where we could create these

51
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,080
virtual immersive story worlds and retail experiences and digital collections as well.

52
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,600
Off the back of that, we ended up working with a lot of big brands like Pokemon, Hello Kitty,

53
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,120
Assassin's Creed, Reebok and started getting to do all of these proof of concept experiments

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,760
around digital and interoperability.

55
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,360
We weren't tackling interoperability from a blockchain perspective at that time.

56
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,080
We were just integrating with lots of different virtual social environments and game environments

57
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,560
where there'd be a version of an asset that was available in each of those spaces.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,600
It helped to prove out the interest in interoperable identity, but it was still a pretty convoluted

59
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
experience.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,800
As a user, you'd have to go into each of these individual environments, go through a separate

61
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,800
checkout flow, and then from a licensing side, everything would have to be contracted out

62
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,040
separately as well.

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,920
It was a nice idea, but certainly not scalable.

64
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,240
I went down the NFT rabbit hole as I was searching for some kind of tech solution to streamline

65
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,880
things, because the goal was to be able to have one central hub.

66
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,760
You could buy something once and then be able to take it into you as many places as you wanted.

67
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,400
As I got more and more involved in that space and that community, one, I realized that this

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,120
was a huge issue that everybody was talking about and trying to figure out.

69
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,600
Two, the ethos of Web3 and decentralization really resonated with me.

70
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,080
My own challenges about being involved in traditional fashion industry, traditional creative industry,

71
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,120
the ethical implications of that.

72
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,760
I really liked the idea of being able to be part of building something that could kickstart

73
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,600
a new generation of creatives and designers.

74
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,120
I shifted my focus from the brand and started building Restless at the beginning of 2021.

75
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,920
The main premise of Restless is it's an easy way for any creator or brand to easily build

76
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,000
and customize interoperable wearables that can plug into both open metaverse and traditional

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
game environments as well as have physical counterparts.

78
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,240
Excellent.

79
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,800
Matsu, do you want to tell us a little bit about your background?

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Sure.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
Thank you for having me.

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,800
I'm super happy to be here.

83
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,880
I'll tell you a little bit about myself and then it will just make sense what the company

84
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,240
that I'm building is.

85
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,880
I've been into VR now for something like the past seven years probably.

86
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,120
A little bit about myself, I grew up in the countryside of friends in the middle of nowhere.

87
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,800
I was the only teenager in my village.

88
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,760
So mostly I grew up with books and computers and they made most of my friends online.

89
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:25,120
When I was probably around 14 years old, the Oculus from Palmer Locky came out.

90
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,720
That was a very big deal back then.

91
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,080
My first thought was this is amazing.

92
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:35,720
If I could have this device, I could hang out with my own layer friends.

93
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,760
Problem is I was a teenager so I couldn't afford to buy a VR headset.

94
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,720
If you imagine it was like a thousand bucks at the time.

95
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,200
So I thought maybe I can build one by myself and I spend a more year building this VR headset

96
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:57,320
from scratch and basically ended up building the same thing as an Oculus but much cheaper.

97
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,240
I got super lucky.

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,800
There was at the time no resources on how to build a VR headset so I sort of had to figure

99
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
all of that by myself.

100
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,200
And in doing so I did things slightly differently.

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,880
And you might even say in some very specific aspects slightly better than Oculus.

102
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,880
So I did that at the time.

103
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,680
Facebook heard about it.

104
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,520
They flew me over to the US.

105
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,000
I got to spend time with the executive team.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,160
Batman Binstow, their chief architect, loved their engineering team, loved the passionate

107
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,800
those people were about the VR.

108
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:40,440
But realized the leadership was in my opinion I felt like those people were coolest about

109
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
the VR and about where VR was headed.

110
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,960
And so I decided to take everything I'd built and open source it all.

111
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,440
The hardware, the firmware, the software, the algorithm, pretty much everything.

112
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,560
And dropped out of high school.

113
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,160
I was something like 15 years old at the time.

114
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:08,840
And dedicated the following four years, retrink to work on the edge of research in the VR.

115
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,240
Both from the hardware and software perspective and game engines and graphics and art.

116
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
And as many things we can talk about later.

117
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,400
And as a side note, if some of you are familiar with it back then I wrote one of the first

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,520
rendering plugin for Unity.

119
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,480
Which is used to make up half of the video games in the world.

120
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,600
And so I created some stuff that are still being used by people today in terms of like

121
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,680
the actual engine of how VR works.

122
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,160
So that was pretty nice.

123
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:49,920
And we have a fantastic relationship with Unity people in general.

124
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,040
And the turning point came, I'm sorry maybe I'm taking a little bit.

125
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,280
Here's a point to this story.

126
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,120
The turning point came.

127
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,960
That was the Quest 2, the VR headset that I'm sure you're all familiar with.

128
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,680
And that VR headset was, it was a before and after.

129
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,720
Everyone bought that VR headset.

130
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,520
They all played with it for about a week, right.

131
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,280
Trying to beat my score at bit saver or whatever that is.

132
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,280
And usually what you'll find is that after one week.

133
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,000
People just stop using it.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,720
And they take it and they put it on a shelf behind them.

135
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,560
And just collecting dust and they just stop using it, right.

136
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,760
And the truth is the VR biggest use case is people are going to be using it for a week

137
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,000
and they're going to put it on a shelf.

138
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,760
And then maybe once or twice a year a friends visit or family visit and they're going to

139
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,440
be like, oh yeah, you want to try it out and you're going to take it out and have your

140
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,720
friends try it.

141
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,280
And that's pretty much it.

142
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,480
Okay, so that was VR back then.

143
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,720
To this day VR still has suffered from those problems.

144
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,800
And it turns out that I have very strong conviction as far as why there is the case.

145
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,320
And we can go very deep into that.

146
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,800
But I'm essentially convinced that as of right now the technology is already there to make

147
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,280
a VR headset that people use every day.

148
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,040
The designers are already there.

149
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,560
They're storytelling the marketing, all of those things could be made.

150
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,680
I just think that meta is not the right company to do it.

151
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,160
And so I went out there, explained exactly how to do it to other companies.

152
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,840
You know, for instance, Unity, right.

153
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,440
I love to make people from Unity.

154
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,600
I went to them and explained to them, hey, this is how you make VR so that it does not

155
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,800
make people sick anymore.

156
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,240
And Unity said, that sounds awesome, go and ask someone else to build it.

157
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,760
I was like, okay, sure.

158
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,160
So then I go and ask NVIDIA because they use some of my stuff as well.

159
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,760
And NVIDIA says, that sounds awesome.

160
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Go and ask Qualcomm.

161
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,440
So I go and talk to Qualcomm and you just did basically no one wanted to build it.

162
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,400
And so at the time I reached out to a novel, a revicant, which might be familiar with

163
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,800
is an investor in crypto and metaverse and many stuff.

164
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,040
And novel convinced me to build my own company.

165
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,800
And so I just started this company and said, if no one wants to build it, I'm going to

166
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,080
build it myself.

167
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,840
And we started off really focused on software, then started expanding into the hardware part

168
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
of it.

169
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,960
And now we're starting to go deep into the design and marketing of that whole thing.

170
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,320
Nothing that we've done is public yet, but I'm super happy to talk about it.

171
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
So we've been very stealthy.

172
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,800
And just so you have an understanding of where the company is at.

173
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,800
So we were based in Mountain View, California.

174
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,680
We've raised quite some money.

175
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,000
We're actually the best funded company in VR hardware currently.

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,480
And we're a super nice team that I'm very proud of, people from Apple, people from Sony

177
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,560
and people from metal.

178
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,200
And some of those people that worked on stuff that you've seen before, some of those people

179
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:17,840
you've even seen on stage before, as those people were on stage during Apple's keynotes.

180
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,200
And so yeah, that's what we do today.

181
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
That's what I work on.

182
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,800
And I guess as a tiny bit more piece of a context, I come very much from hardware, but

183
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,360
sort of then graduated into trying to become much better at software.

184
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,640
And the past, I would say here, also, has been really about design and marketing.

185
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,320
And so I guess where my perspective might be interesting for a question is, I have a pretty

186
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:49,280
good understanding of what it takes for VR to go mainstream, but also the history of

187
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,600
host of goes mainstream.

188
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,120
And it might be interesting to talk about some of my perspective on why is it that some

189
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,360
things like crypto or VR might seem like they are experiencing what some people might call

190
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,680
the winter.

191
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
And how do you get through that?

192
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,040
And maybe I can bring some historical perspective on that.

193
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,640
So that's me in a nutshell.

194
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,640
Fantastic.

195
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,920
And Brian, you're talking about yourself and on the shoulder.

196
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,120
After this introduction is pretty hard for me to be able to tell myself.

197
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:30,440
Yeah, I mean, the story of On-Samper and myself is really the story of a kid who wanted to

198
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
do something useful in VR3.

199
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,680
I think I started getting interested in 2krypto when I was about 12 or 13.

200
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,080
A long time ago.

201
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,000
And I didn't directly get into crypto, but got into really admired the tech.

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,960
Took me about 10 years to finally get him and build a product in it.

203
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,120
In the meantime, I was building product and I left a program and such.

204
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,760
My dad is in the art world.

205
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,120
So I had been around art creation and art and contacts with artists, et cetera, for my

206
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,440
whole life.

207
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,400
When mid 2020, I find out about NFTs and directly it clicks.

208
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,560
I directly noticed what it can do for creatives, what it can do for the relations that creatives

209
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,920
have with their collectors.

210
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,800
Where in the art world, there's a very central assistant for people to go and get the approval

211
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,480
of dealers and galleries and whatnot.

212
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,120
I thought Web3 and NFTs could come into free up creatives all around the world.

213
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,520
Any kid like myself from Morocco and I know so many examples would be able to go and sell

214
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,480
stuff on foundation and whatnot and make money without ever having to kiss the hand

215
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,600
of a random art dealer in Morocco.

216
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,880
So I thought that was pretty interesting.

217
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,600
But at the time when I started to look at this, there were very few platforms that would

218
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,480
allow people to story tell with art.

219
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,800
I think at the time the biggest platforms were Decentraland and CryptoVoxels in the immersive

220
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,120
space and then the other options for curation would be in 2D.

221
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,320
Of course, adding a dimension makes it easier for people to curate art and to enjoy art.

222
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,920
So we needed a proper immersive experience or immersive experience platform for people

223
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:17,560
to showcase and discover art and to visualize Web3, the culture in Web3 in a sense.

224
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,440
But there were none and the only way to get into curation in Web3 at the time was to go

225
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,160
buy a lamp on Decentraland and hire an architect and do a bunch of very redundant actions just

226
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,640
to be able to exhibit art.

227
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,720
Most people were actually going and buying a lamp on these platforms to do exactly those

228
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,400
functions.

229
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,600
And so I went and thought, hey, there is definitely a use case somewhere here where people want

230
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,560
to showcase their assets in immersive spaces and connect around immersive spaces.

231
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,440
I do not know what this metaverse is ever going to be.

232
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,960
I do not know what exactly people are going to want to do, but I know I can have a link

233
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,680
with a bunch of people right now that are early adopters that want to experience with

234
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,160
these technologies.

235
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,000
And so the idea was we're going to go and build this simplest product for people to

236
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,720
place and discover assets in immersive spaces.

237
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,440
And from there, try to listen as much as possible for the community's feedback and what people

238
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:18,040
want to do in these immersive spaces to just build layer after layer after layer for something

239
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,760
that makes sense.

240
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,760
What we're doing today.

241
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,840
And in OM, for example, like I would have never guessed when I was in this very same

242
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:30,760
bedroom at my parents house in Morocco when I started the company two years ago.

243
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,040
But again, I think the one thing that we've had within the team is that we've always been

244
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,400
very open as to what this could be, what the metaverse landscape is going to be, what

245
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,040
the immersive web should be.

246
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:47,240
And we just kept on listening to our community, building another layer and building another

247
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
functionality.

248
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:55,160
So I think the story of a one-siber as a company that's fully bottomed up, that listens to

249
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:01,480
people, that will always go in and find the latest piece of feedback that our users want

250
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,520
and will go in and implement that so that we end up having a product that truly resonates

251
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,560
with real humans rather than just having ideas about what an immersive world should be and

252
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,800
just developing it from the ground up until it's ready.

253
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,560
So yeah, that's pretty much me and my story.

254
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,400
Okay, this was fantastic.

255
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,160
And I'll have about 11 million questions.

256
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,200
Let me start with some specific questions addressed to specific people.

257
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,000
And then later we'll do the more integrative ones.

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,120
And again, I want to start with Charlie.

259
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,920
I want to give you the opportunity to address the following thing that I have heard one

260
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,800
billion times.

261
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,640
I don't want digital wearables.

262
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,280
Why do I need digital wearables?

263
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
I want real clothes.

264
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,600
I want a real purse.

265
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,920
Why would I spend money on that stuff?

266
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,000
Obviously, this is not NFT people.

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,560
Let's call it normal people.

268
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,560
Right?

269
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,440
So when I've had this discussion, what are NFTs good for?

270
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,760
Not saying different things, but one of the things I always say is digital wearables.

271
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,040
And like 80% of the time, this is the answer.

272
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,800
Can I give my response with my guesses?

273
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,480
You probably have a better, more nuanced thought than this.

274
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,200
So the floor is yours.

275
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,440
Sure.

276
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:28,320
So I think usually my first question in response to that mentality is, have you ever used a

277
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,320
profile picture?

278
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,760
Have you ever curated an Instagram feed?

279
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,040
Have you ever used a filter on social media?

280
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,360
Generally the answer to at least one of those things, if not all three of them, is yes.

281
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,280
And then we can start digging into, well, clearly you care about your digital identity

282
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,560
to some extent.

283
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:55,920
And as technology develops and your digital identity is represented increasingly in 3D

284
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:03,880
spaces and as an avatar, then wearables are going to be the equivalent to changing your

285
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,480
profile picture or curating your Instagram feed.

286
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:16,520
And then also is always nice to point out the $60 billion skins industry within traditional

287
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,800
gaming as well.

288
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:28,640
There is a complete precedent for a whole generation, two generations, the value that

289
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,880
digital identity enough to be investing heavily in game wearables.

290
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,360
And this doesn't even have the functionality of NFTs where you own it, where you can take

291
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:47,560
it into other spaces, where it's, you know, often you can't resell it for actual money.

292
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:53,440
And NFT wearables are taking something that is already a massive industry and making it

293
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,320
even more valuable and even more scalable.

294
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,880
But I think usually the key is just like focusing in on digital identity, which is something

295
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,440
that most people have been participating in for the last couple of decades.

296
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,040
And then it starts to click a little bit more why sometime in the future they might

297
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,840
be investing in that in a slightly different way.

298
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
Okay.

299
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,160
So I agree with everything you said, obviously.

300
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,280
Now what if someone says that's fine.

301
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:32,120
Of course I have a profile picture on Instagram or LinkedIn or Twitter and they might even

302
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
be different.

303
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,760
But I didn't spend money on it and I put one once to like I'm changing it all the time.

304
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,600
Is this something in gaming, I hear you on gaming, but that's like I don't know if people

305
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,960
will play a lot of games.

306
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,920
Is this just something for people with games?

307
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,720
I'm a normal person.

308
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,480
I have a social media presence.

309
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,520
I'm not a big gamer.

310
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,400
Is this just something that's not for me or is it going to be different?

311
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, I guess then it comes to the concept of fashion and subculture and community full

312
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
stops.

313
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,680
It's like, have you ever done anything within the physical world, made a physical purchase

314
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,080
because in some way it connected you more to a community.

315
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,680
In some way it was a flex.

316
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,960
Have you ever bought a pair of limited edition sneakers?

317
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,200
What was the reason behind that?

318
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,800
And then it's sort of taking that and like, okay, well, if the only place or the primary

319
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,760
place that you're going to be connecting with that community or showcasing that flex is

320
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,920
in digital, then isn't the digital version of that asset actually more valuable?

321
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:57,000
I think the first thing, why are you buying some combination of why you buy a limited edition

322
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,400
sneaker and what your profile pictures and why it changes and the skins somewhere in

323
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
there is the reality.

324
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:16,600
I think there is probably some room for us as a community to find a shorter, piffier way

325
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,600
to get this across.

326
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,320
I don't know why the team Bitcoin figured this out right now to talk about Bitcoin.

327
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,920
You're holding it, digital gold or what have you.

328
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:35,720
There's probably something there because it's a very common response on this topic.

329
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,280
Practically it'll probably just happen naturally.

330
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
Maybe we can accelerate.

331
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:45,640
Anything you want to add there, should I go to McSee?

332
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,640
I think we can go over to my team.

333
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Hi, McSee.

334
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,840
Let me make sure I understood this correctly.

335
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,400
You went around to all the biggest technology companies in the world all like multiple tens

336
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,040
or hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions and you have concluded none of them know how

337
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,240
to build a concept so you're going to build your own.

338
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Did I understand this correctly?

339
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,040
You can say that way.

340
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,840
I'm summarizing it the way I understood it.

341
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,480
You were going to build a better headset.

342
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,400
This is the takeaway.

343
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:22,200
I think we at the company, it's not many people.

344
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,080
I think we have a shot at building a better headset.

345
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,720
I mean that's in the very holistic sense.

346
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:37,200
I think one critical aspect of, as I'm sure you realize actually being in crypto, is it's

347
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,400
certainly about the product, it's also about the messaging of the product and your ability

348
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,800
to convey that and to educate people about it.

349
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:52,280
And yeah, I'm happy to be more specific but I think the way you broke it down is it would

350
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,880
be accurate, although we don't say it like that.

351
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,760
Right, of course not because you're modest and appropriate.

352
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,960
What does a better headset mean?

353
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,760
Facebook has put, I don't know how many billions of dollars into a headset.

354
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Okay, well that's cool.

355
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
I'm a smart guy.

356
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Mine's going to be better.

357
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,960
Why is it going to be better?

358
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
How is it going to be better?

359
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,760
What's missing today that when your headset comes out, will be much happier?

360
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Sure.

361
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:34,800
I think that's a fascinating question and one way I'll try to answer is rather than going

362
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:42,400
into the very specific difference between my headset and their headset, maybe what I

363
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,680
can try doing and if it's interesting, we can keep pulling on that thread, is talk a

364
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:54,200
little bit about the cultural differences between the people making decisions at the

365
00:25:54,200 --> 00:26:03,120
Metap or Apple and the people that I'm a part of and that most people in this sort of metaverse

366
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,840
movement are part of and where are the cultural differences between them.

367
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,880
And the reason for that is one of my belief is, you know, if you look at a company like

368
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:22,480
Google, Google has tried many times to compete with Apple in the smartphone market and Google

369
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,400
has infinite amount of money and yet they're not able to compete with Apple, right?

370
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:33,160
Like their phone are setting much less units than the iPhone.

371
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,160
So they're not able to compete with the iPhone despite having infinite amount of money.

372
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,920
So it means that there's something else that Apple has that Google does not have and that

373
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:49,320
thing is a set of belief and that thing is essentially culture.

374
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,880
And so rather than telling you exactly the specs in terms of difference, I think it's

375
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,720
worth it to talk about the cultural differences between Metap or Apple and those companies

376
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,200
and us.

377
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:10,600
And if I try to break down the cultural difference, the most important point and I think that

378
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:18,120
if you have one thing to take away from me, it would be that it's the fact that to those

379
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:28,160
people, virtual worlds have a zero sum game relationship with the real world.

380
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:34,400
So it essentially means is that to those people, the time you spend in a virtual world is time

381
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,840
lost in real life.

382
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,480
It's like minus one hour spent in that virtual world.

383
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,040
It's like one hour that you're not spending in real life and it's like this idea of like

384
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,880
wasted time.

385
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,280
And I think it's pretty deep into the psyche of those people.

386
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,360
And so one of the consequences of that is in the way they designed the headset and the

387
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,480
way they designed the experiences and the marketing of it, basically what they try to

388
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,400
convince you of is take your life and move your entire life to the metaverse.

389
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:11,720
And then the reaction that people have to that is, well, this is going to take away

390
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,320
stuff from my real life that I would rather not do in VR, right?

391
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,000
The predict perception of VR is pretty dystopian because people think that, no, I want to make

392
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,880
friends in real life, not only in VR.

393
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,120
And so the mental framework of those people is always trying to put in opposition the

394
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,400
real life in VR.

395
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:38,680
Whereas what I find with my friends and myself, instead of the people either from my generation

396
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:45,960
or with the same kind of interest is that they really think of virtual worlds in their

397
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,680
daily life as sort of this balanced relationship where some of the most valuable time in their

398
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:01,120
real life came as a result of the time they spent in virtual worlds.

399
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:08,120
And so in that sense, I would say the core difference is meta is trying to think about

400
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:11,800
how to keep you inside the VR headset as long as possible.

401
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,680
I'm trying hard to think about how can I make you very happy when you take the VR headset

402
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
off?

403
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,520
It's like, what do you get away from the experience?

404
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,760
And so I realized it's a little bit abstract, so let me make that, let me get into more specific

405
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,400
examples.

406
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:40,360
Let me try to think of a great one.

407
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,240
All right.

408
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,160
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the art chat.

409
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:55,360
And I'm sure as many of you are familiar with Facebook Horizon, which is the competitor

410
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,080
to the art chat.

411
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,920
And it seems as though regardless of how much money meta is pouring into Horizon, Horizon

412
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,520
is not able to compete with VR chats.

413
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,200
VR chat is just swinging whereas Horizon is not.

414
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,400
And if you try to think, how is that possible?

415
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,720
Why can't they just copy VR chat into the exact same thing?

416
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,640
The reason why that is not possible is that as much as the people using VR chat every

417
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,760
day and I've used VR chat a lot, love the time they spent inside VR chat, the most valuable

418
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,840
thing they get out of VR chat actually happens outside of VR.

419
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,000
It's the fact that those friends that you've made in VR chat, they just become friends

420
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,760
as a whole in your daily life, the rest of your life.

421
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,200
And you might even try to meet them in real life.

422
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,560
It's the ability to be able to go inside VR chat.

423
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,040
And after you've had maybe a long or stressful day, took to people and sort of have them

424
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,760
and have like those sort of deep emotional meaningful conversation, and then you get

425
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,640
out of VR and you feel better.

426
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,240
It's like all those things that happen in VR and directly reflect back to your real

427
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,400
life.

428
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,080
And somehow every time something has that characteristic, it happens in VR but reflects

429
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,760
in real life, meta is just not able to do it right.

430
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,640
And instead what they offer you is, instead we're going to take, we're just going to

431
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,400
increase the amount of time you can spend in VR.

432
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:27,520
So if you look at the feature list of Horizon, they prioritize stuff like bring your laptop

433
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
to Horizon.

434
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,760
Because that's the way to sort of day thing that's going to like try to keep you longer

435
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:40,760
in Horizon as opposed to how do we increase the ratio of meaningful conversation in Horizon

436
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,600
as opposed to non meaningful conversation.

437
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,560
And like the way you design that changes, like the way you think about it changes widely

438
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,200
the design of like this from that form.

439
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,320
So that would be like my very, very high strike high level answer that like I'm happy to dive

440
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,480
into it, but I'm also realizing you might want something a little more specific.

441
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,960
So I also share some specific details about my headset in terms of the philosophy of the

442
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
headset itself.

443
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,840
Yeah, I'm trying to be mindful of the time at the same time, but I also want to give

444
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,560
you a little bit of a nuggets about the headset.

445
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,000
So I'll choose one vertical and then I'm happy to talk about one.

446
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,480
One vertical would be how do we think about comfort?

447
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,280
And for that, I have to tell you a little bit more about again, how does company design

448
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,880
their VR headset?

449
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,720
The way VR headset is usually designed is you have a team that's going to come up with

450
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,120
a list of features.

451
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,840
Some of them are going to be hard requirements.

452
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,600
Some of them are not stuff like facial tracking or body tracking or whatever.

453
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,680
Once you have those features, you define what you need to achieve those features and then

454
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,920
you build those gigantic prototypes like the one you saw in maybe Zercoverer's video.

455
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,080
And once you have the gigantic prototypes, you try to make them smaller and then you send

456
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,880
that to a factory, try to make it as small as possible without it breaking and then you

457
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,560
have a headset and then you put that to market.

458
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,760
That's how VR headsets is traditionally designed.

459
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,760
One of the things we've decided to do at UNIGAT is to absolutely refuse to do that.

460
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,400
And we start the other way.

461
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,800
We try to make VR headsets just made out of plastic and we just try to make them as comfortable

462
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,320
as possible.

463
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,840
And then we put them on a ton of people, we put weights inside and we try to see when

464
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,080
they stop being comfortable.

465
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,320
And we find those threshold and we spend a lot of time trying to find what is comfortable

466
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,840
or what is not and then we work it backwards and we say, okay, what features can we fit

467
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,840
inside the headset without it being stopping to be comfortable.

468
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,480
And what we find is that there's a lot of features out there that you might not have

469
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,360
in the UNIVR headset.

470
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,320
But that's because we started from this perspective of comfortable, maybe I had to remove a few

471
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,680
features and our criteria when we looked at that feature is does that feature and that's

472
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,320
how it ties back to the beginning of my story, does that feature benefits you once you take

473
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,360
off the headset, yes or no.

474
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,360
And does it make a significant difference?

475
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,200
So for instance, a VR headset that you might have heard of, the PyMax, it's like this one

476
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,960
kilogram gigantic thing that I'm not making this up is like this large.

477
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:33,160
And the PyMax, I don't know if I can say this publicly, but the difference in resolution

478
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:37,920
between our headset and the PyMax, which is the headset with the highest resolution of

479
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:43,040
all time, it's like, again, this one kilogram gigantic big thing on your face.

480
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:50,720
The percentage of like more resolution that they have is in the single digit branch.

481
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,240
That's like, well, I'll share for now.

482
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:58,400
But for that single digit, it's so hard to increase resolution that it results in this

483
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,200
like gigantic system that is incredibly heavy with like two big cables plugged at the back

484
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,360
of it.

485
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,800
And that system is indeed like, I don't know, like four times higher resolution than a

486
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Quest.

487
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,880
But the price of it is like being so huge.

488
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:21,400
In our case, we're not quite to that resolution, but we've been so hot core about ergonomics

489
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,360
that like it fits into something that is about a tenth of the weight of that thing.

490
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,120
So this is probably one of the most ergonomic VR headset out there.

491
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:40,920
And again, that's because we ask ourselves at the end of the day, if the resolution was

492
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,560
like even twice as much when you take off the headset, what are the chances that you're

493
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,400
like, oh, yeah, like this is really making my day much better that the resolution was

494
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,800
like twice as much.

495
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
It matters, but not as much as people think.

496
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,240
And thus it shouldn't be, it shouldn't have that big of an influence on the design.

497
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,520
So anyway, there's a long answer, but that's sort of how we approach things.

498
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:10,240
Long answer and still did not reveal any trade secrets.

499
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,600
We did not manage to, you know, yeah, I'll find out.

500
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,600
All right, let's go to Ryan.

501
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,400
I don't know if Ryan's on the very specific.

502
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,760
Yes, it started art focus now it's doing many things, but for me, what it always attracted

503
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:36,960
me to on cyber and I've spent an infinity amount of time working on on cyber is grand

504
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:48,880
of those is your role objective of it being open and built on open standards.

505
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,400
What does that mean?

506
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
What does open mean?

507
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,400
What does close mean?

508
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,680
How does it different what are the opportunities challenges, et cetera?

509
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:05,080
Yeah, I mean, like, so one thing is we on on cyber is a child of the work through space.

510
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,000
So, so like we started because we wanted to like fulfill the need within the work space,

511
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,840
not necessarily because we wanted to build general immersive experiences or whatnot.

512
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,280
So the whole point has been that we have been building with very strong foundations for

513
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,840
a progressive decentralization.

514
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:28,040
I think there's a lot of companies in this space that like are built within with different

515
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,320
principles and want to be open.

516
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,840
But at some point, like when your foundations are aren't able to be open, like it's very

517
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,680
hard for you to ever be part of a lot of space.

518
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,560
What that means in our case is that from the ground up, we built on cyber on free opens

519
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
or software.

520
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:49,800
So there's no proprietary engine involved and we've never we're never going to have to

521
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:56,880
answer to a big corporation that would own the proprietary engine or have a say in what's

522
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,400
happening with their engine, which is not the case for everyone.

523
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,640
And it's it's hard to do because like you have to rebuild a lot of things from the ground

524
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,640
up.

525
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,480
But I think it's the way that you can truly be free long term and have your users and

526
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,120
community free.

527
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,360
Number two is that we make sure that all assets are stored in the open.

528
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,400
So there's like the whole principle of Web3 is your content and you can take it whatever

529
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,840
you want.

530
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,960
There is nothing within on Saber that isn't stored in the open.

531
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,840
Of course, like there's different storage is not necessarily always the most efficient

532
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,640
or faster performance type of solution for first storage, which is why we have always

533
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,480
have like surfacing CDNs and different services that do things faster.

534
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,640
But at the end of the day, all data is stored in the open and can be taken and taken from

535
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,720
like, let's take the example of all spaces built with on Saber or this space metacampus

536
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
that we're on right now.

537
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,880
It is yes, stored on CDN, but also stored on IPFS.

538
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:05,280
And if need be if ever tomorrow something happened and on Saber wasn't working anymore,

539
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,360
you could totally take this space taken to another platform that uses the same standard

540
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:18,160
we do, which is a pretty common standard in the web called GLTF, which is like what I

541
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,040
would say is the equivalent of an HTML in the immersive web.

542
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,840
And you would be able to run exactly the same space, exactly the same architecture and completely

543
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
different platform.

544
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:35,840
So for me, what open means is number one, you can restrict access to it and everyone can

545
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:40,320
participate, which is why we don't have Google login or anything similar.

546
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,240
But you can just log in with any type of wallet and soon enough can log in without a wallet

547
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
even.

548
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,800
Number two, I think that I spoke about it before, you cannot have a proprietary tech

549
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,760
at the basis of the tech.

550
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:00,280
And so we have chosen not to go with anything proprietary or a proprietary engine.

551
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,640
And that there is very low, low cost to switching.

552
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,640
So you don't want to make it so that people come in and are locked into it.

553
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,200
Like most web two platforms do, like Instagram does or whatnot, like there's no way to go

554
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,320
port your content easily.

555
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:21,560
But with us, the idea is to have all those principles and follow them very, very closely.

556
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,280
Of course, we don't know what, like, as I said, On Saber is a work in progress.

557
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,720
It's a bottom up type of product.

558
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:35,000
And we cannot know everything we need to do to do to everything we need to decentralize

559
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,280
in order to be truly open from the ground up.

560
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,440
But all our foundations are very open.

561
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,240
And as we go without losing too much time on, oh, I think this should be decentralized

562
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,800
or stored on chain or off chain or whatnot, we can go pretty fast while having a clear

563
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,080
avenue for decentralization whenever we know exactly what that means and how that can be

564
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,600
done efficiently.

565
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:07,000
So yeah, that's pretty much like what I think we are doing right now to be able to be part

566
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,800
of the open metaverse.

567
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,800
Yeah.

568
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,800
Okay.

569
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:18,960
Usually, I mean, this is the story of many things.

570
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,640
Usually centralized solutions at a minimum start with some advantages, right?

571
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:30,880
They usually tend to, you know, they're more convenient or they're more easily packaged

572
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,400
up or they come with more prepackaged features or what have you.

573
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,480
And sometimes it has worked out that open standards have taken a hold of HTML, not the

574
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,440
information superhighway.

575
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,520
Other times, you know, Linux for the desktop never really happened, but Linux eventually

576
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,080
over decades when the server market.

577
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:04,080
How do you view the strategic landscape here between a wide variety of closed or semi-closed

578
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,960
platforms, you know, using quite mature game engines in most cases, right?

579
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,520
You know, Unreal Engine or Unity who don't have to worry about any types of don't have

580
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,160
to spend any cycles, development cycles or feature cycles and performance cycles trying

581
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
to keep it decentralized and so on.

582
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Whatever it is going to deliver.

583
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,520
We're going to deliver end user experience.

584
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,000
How do you see this?

585
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,440
It's a very interesting question.

586
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,800
And I think we have to go back to our text text to try to start answering this question.

587
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:41,440
Whenever we, when I started on Saber, there were, of course, like many choices we had

588
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,440
to make.

589
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,360
Like, what do we want to, what's the target for the build on Saber?

590
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,000
What, how people are going to access it?

591
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,720
Like, what's going to happen there?

592
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,480
We chose the browser because to me, today is the most open type of distribution channel

593
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,560
to go and reach people with apps.

594
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,200
Like, web apps are very hard to be censored and can be distributed as you want if people

595
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
have a link.

596
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
So we decided to go with that.

597
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,960
And with that, chose 3.js as a technology for like the basis of our tech.

598
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:21,320
So the Linux in this case would be 3.js slash web.gls slash web.gpu, I guess.

599
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,560
And then our focus is to make sure that we can build the best possible experience for

600
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:32,440
our users and build the best possible UX for people to come in and enjoy being in those

601
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:40,880
immersive worlds, which are themselves like run by web.gls, web.gpu soon and free open

602
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
source software.

603
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Okay.

604
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:51,520
Let's do another round on kind of state of today in adoption.

605
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,920
I'm going to go back to Charlie.

606
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,240
How many, where are digital wearables now?

607
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
Right?

608
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,240
Where are people using them?

609
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,880
How many are the using them?

610
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,560
What types of things are you seeing developing in the background that, you know, our average

611
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:11,400
person today might not know about?

612
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,840
And how do you expect this to change over the next one, two, three years?

613
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Sure.

614
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,840
So I think like the key use cases for digital wearables right now are either in-game and

615
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,400
like thinking more traditional gaming industry, whether it's like the daily active user base,

616
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,920
generally a younger audience as collectibles.

617
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,760
So I guess you're more like typical web three speculative NFT investment.

618
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:48,120
Or as a way to unlock either physical redeemables, so like physical wearable utility, or more

619
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,560
as like ticketing to events.

620
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,480
So a lot of traditional fashion brands that have tried to enter the NFT space have based

621
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,920
the utility around like access to fashion shows, like, yeah, special, like VIP access

622
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,120
within their flagship stores and so on.

623
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:13,520
So everything is quite heavily focused around existing fashion use cases, like you're, you

624
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:20,280
know, you're literally wearing it in the physical world in a game, or it's giving you some kind

625
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,240
of status.

626
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:32,960
And I think right now, like the best web three use case for digital identity is the PFP.

627
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,520
And you know, you wouldn't necessarily think of that as fashion, but it's doing very much

628
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,520
the same thing.

629
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:42,080
It's like signaling you as part of a community.

630
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,840
It's saying something about your status.

631
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,400
It's saying something about how early you are into the web three space.

632
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,480
You know, it's communicating a lot in the same way that the passion does.

633
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:00,760
So I see the evolution of wearables, like what does the PFP mean as we start to socialize

634
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:08,920
more in 3D spaces as interoperable identity in open metaverse actually becomes something

635
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,400
that there is like clear use case for.

636
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:20,600
So, you know, it relies a lot, I think initially on a move from like text based social media

637
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:28,560
like Twitter and Discord into social media happening within 3D spaces, which, you know,

638
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,200
there are lots of amazing builders very proactively working on at the moment.

639
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:43,520
The like the gaming use case isn't going to go away, but we are, you know, away off traditional

640
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,840
game developers allowing external assets into their games.

641
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:56,560
There's definitely an intent from like big game developers like Epic Ubisoft roadblocks

642
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,440
to start, you know, exploring how they integrate with web three.

643
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
Nobody really wants to be a first mover.

644
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:09,480
There's a lot of pushback from the gaming community as well.

645
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,600
So I guess one of the first things that needs to happen there is like just entirely abstracting

646
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,640
away from talking about web three and NFTs and just, you know, creating new language

647
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640
around it.

648
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:27,720
There's visceral reaction from their existing player bases.

649
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:35,880
I think one of the first things that we'll see around interoperability within game developers

650
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,240
is just within properties that that developer owns.

651
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,400
So like for example, Epic opening up wearables and assets.

652
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,160
So it could be used across like full guys, Rocket League Fortnite and so on.

653
00:47:52,160 --> 00:48:00,200
And I think we will start to see specific partnerships with these game developers where

654
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:05,680
they are exploring a level of interoperability, but it's still going to be extremely pleased

655
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:12,080
and sort of, you know, very narrow in terms of the partners that they work with.

656
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:18,840
In terms of traditional fashion industry coming in, I think it's a less interesting proposition

657
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:23,480
than new gen brands that are web three native starting up.

658
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:28,840
I think there's a, as we kind of touched on with the first question you asked me, there's

659
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:35,200
a whole lot of convincing for a, you know, a large subset of people of the value of digital

660
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,840
wearables.

661
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:42,320
I think the luxury fashion brands that came into the space over the last couple of years

662
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:47,640
and by consulting for some of them were extremely surprised to find that none of their existing

663
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:55,360
customer base were interested in adopting a web theory or buying NFTs and that actually

664
00:48:55,360 --> 00:49:03,600
their entire web three business needed to be contingent on their involvement in the web

665
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,600
three community.

666
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:15,280
So there's still like a huge division, I think, between like Jen Alpha, Gen Z who are used

667
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,560
to the idea of digital wearable utility, a more traditional, I guess, as he said, like

668
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:29,280
normal demographic where you need some kind of physical utility to make it make sense

669
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:36,280
and web three audience where there's the understanding, like collecting something and having value

670
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:38,800
over time.

671
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:46,840
But I think, yeah, the main, the main first big step for adoption is social media in 3D

672
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:50,000
spaces being the norm.

673
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,720
So this is fascinating what you said because I think it matches what we see for the most

674
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,720
part in art.

675
00:49:55,720 --> 00:50:02,400
So the major NFT art collectors are not on the whole, there's some famous exceptions,

676
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,240
but like on the whole, they are not big traditional art collectors.

677
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:14,240
They are people who grew up in the web three space and then found that NFT art varies types,

678
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,480
represents their values and culture and what have you.

679
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,680
You're saying the same thing is happening in fashion?

680
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,320
Yes, exactly.

681
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:30,440
You have very divided demographics and it's, you know, it's completely based on how do

682
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:35,520
you value your identity and if your identity is born of internet culture, like most of

683
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,040
us in this space, that's where you're going to pin more value is where you're going to

684
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:45,440
be willing to spend more time, more money, like whatever investment looks like to you.

685
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:52,840
Whereas if status or identity has always been rooted in your physical world or physical

686
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:59,600
community, it's yet very difficult to imagine that switch.

687
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:07,880
And so my parents and family are in the traditional art space, like art dealers and tea dealers.

688
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:16,880
So I've seen like that side of what status looks like and the challenge in explaining

689
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:21,600
the value of what a digital collectible looks like to somebody who's in Thai business is

690
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,160
dealing in physical, and I can see like Ryan is smiling.

691
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,160
Same situation.

692
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,600
I mean, I say that my mum was signed up to this university course and it's like fully

693
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:41,440
degenerated into web theory, but certainly it's like a big learning curve.

694
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:52,240
Whereas I'd say especially my younger friends and also younger team members, absolutely

695
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:59,240
normal to them that they would be spending more time worrying about what their digital

696
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,120
identity, digital community and online friends are up to you.

697
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,120
This is fascinating.

698
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,120
I think it's right.

699
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,320
I think we're going to have a generational shift.

700
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,400
It'll be massive, but it'll take time because it's generational.

701
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,600
Where do you think the, I mean, nobody knows for sure.

702
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,600
And there's of course huge examples on the other side, right?

703
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:22,960
There's some more digital native older people.

704
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,960
There's some boomerish younger people.

705
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:31,840
We know that's the case, but broadly, if you had to like pick a number, what age or what

706
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,040
year of birth or where does the internet native generation start?

707
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,040
Who are they?

708
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:45,360
I would say it's Jen Alpha, internet native in terms of that, like it's just the standard

709
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:53,280
for them that all of their socializing takes place in like avatar based virtual environments.

710
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,880
They already understand the idea of trading in digital identity.

711
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,600
Like it's the eight to 12 year olds right now who are already doing that in roadblocks

712
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,840
and Minecraft.

713
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:15,120
I think with Gen Z and this is just like speculative based on like my guess my own observations.

714
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:30,880
I think there is a little bit more seriousness in that generation where the idea of, I guess,

715
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,120
like, you know, exploring identity, like starting a business, trading within the digital world,

716
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:44,240
like those feel, I guess, not as comfortable compared to like the younger like siblings

717
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,920
and cousins in my family who are this like younger roadblocks generation.

718
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,520
So you know, we pin like so much hope on Gen Z is like, okay, this is going to be the

719
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,840
metaverse future.

720
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:59,760
But I think there's actually a lot more resistance there.

721
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,480
And if you spend any time on TikTok and have ever looked at posts around NFTs, the like

722
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,600
the vitriol from that generation around NFTs and Web3 is probably the highest of any generation.

723
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,480
So Gen Z is going to let us down again.

724
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,040
I mean, sorry Gen Z.

725
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,040
Very interesting.

726
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,040
All right.

727
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,040
Let's switch to let's see.

728
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:25,040
Let's see.

729
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:32,560
You said something in your initial remarks and I laughed because I went back in 2013.

730
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,120
I think it was 2013.

731
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,920
It was Christmas of 2013.

732
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,800
It was in New York and the first Samsung gear VR device came out.

733
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,200
It wasn't 13, it was 12.

734
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,200
So I bought it.

735
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:53,160
I have this general who I'm for sure the oldest person in this panel.

736
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,440
But I have a general and I will share it with everyone.

737
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,800
It's a good way to try and not become outdated.

738
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,920
Anytime a new technological thing happens, I just do it without thinking about if it makes

739
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,920
sense or not.

740
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:14,200
Because if you think about if it makes sense, as you pass, I don't know, the age of 25 or

741
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:18,080
30 somewhere in there, you suddenly think like nothing actually makes sense.

742
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:24,720
Oh no, that's not the things that, who wrote it, Douglas Adams wrote it.

743
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,560
Things that happened before you were 25 are natural state of the world, right?

744
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:33,800
Things that when you're 25 to 40 are an exciting career opportunity and things that are invented

745
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:37,560
after 40 are terrible and against the natural order of things, right?

746
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,760
This is how you will, this is how humans default work and you should assume you'll be a default

747
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,760
human.

748
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,560
And so you should assume your bias is going to be against new things once you get passed

749
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,640
on in 25 or 27 or 30.

750
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:55,360
So I have this general who now, once I started in a very American, whatever, whatever happens,

751
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,720
anything new, I just do it.

752
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:03,080
I take away from myself the decision of should I spend money on a VR set?

753
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,080
There's a VR set I'm gonna buy it.

754
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,080
And then I do my Virgo.

755
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,080
I put it on.

756
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,800
I hang it at like that helicopter and Iceland scene or something.

757
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:16,440
I was like, holy, I'm not gonna say this was a university course, but this is the most

758
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,200
incredible thing I've ever seen.

759
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:24,480
This is like, so I called my mom and my dad and everyone I know and I was like, you gotta

760
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,680
come over and everyone's like, you gotta be kidding me.

761
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:27,680
This is amazing, huh?

762
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,640
And a month later, I was sitting on the shelf gathering desk.

763
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,200
And I have the Oculus channel and it's more or less sitting on the shelf and I've gone

764
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,840
in to see all of it right like that.

765
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:48,960
But here I am actively building a platform that displays on the web and displays in VR.

766
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:57,040
And I would say 99% of the time I spend in that platform is on the web.

767
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,640
It's not in VR.

768
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:06,520
It's quite frankly, at least for me, I find it to be kind of a pain.

769
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:12,120
Yes, I want to check out something at home going through the browser is easy.

770
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,680
Going and finding their headset, putting it on, messing up my hair.

771
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,480
Oh, I forgot to charge it.

772
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,960
Oh, I had to plug it in all this stuff.

773
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,800
God forbid because someone comes sees you.

774
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,560
You look like a complete weirdo, right?

775
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:26,040
Like if someone comes in and likes it.

776
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,640
So what's going on there?

777
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:31,120
Like when are we actually going to adopt VR?

778
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,760
What needs to happen for us to adopt VR?

779
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,440
Does it matter if we adopt VR?

780
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,160
I assume it does given you're spending your life building VR headsets.

781
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,520
Tell us about this topic.

782
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:42,520
Sure.

783
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,760
That's a fantastic question.

784
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,320
I love it.

785
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,480
Let me give you the super short answer first.

786
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:56,960
The super short answer is interesting because it builds on what I used set before 6.5.2.9

787
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:07,160
in Charlie, which is if you look at the very, very young kids like I look at my cousins,

788
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,560
they are already using VR almost every day.

789
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:15,920
So you already have, in fact, millions of kids, the very, very young ones that are using VR,

790
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,280
that there is almost the only one using it very actively.

791
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,280
But still that does not answer your question of why do, like, why is it depending on the

792
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,280
process?

793
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,680
And I think you're right.

794
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:31,400
It absolutely is.

795
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,160
Some of you might have seen that Fred going on on Twitter.

796
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,160
It's a fascinating one.

797
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,960
It's like someone that basically explains that it took them about 35 minutes to get into

798
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,040
a multiplayer session with their brother in VR.

799
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,880
And so you describe the process pretty well.

800
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,160
Usually the way it goes is you grab the headset, you try turning it on.

801
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,160
Nothing happens.

802
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,360
You turn it down, press the button again.

803
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,400
Okay, because when it's turned off, you have to press for a little longer, actually.

804
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,440
Then it turns on and actually, no, there's no battery left.

805
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,520
So you have to charge it because the battery drains with sub plug.

806
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:11,680
So you charge it for about, as you end up, it's like two hours and a half.

807
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,480
You charge it for a while, then you take it, then you turn it on.

808
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:19,800
Then you have to, for some reason, sometimes you have to pair it again with your phone.

809
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,800
Not even really know why.

810
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,400
Turn on Bluetooth, 30 seconds.

811
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,280
That's like a, actually I shouldn't say that to you.

812
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,080
Actually, no hope when it happens.

813
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,080
The number is crazy.

814
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,320
It was a bug they tracked back at the middle.

815
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,320
And it's a crazy one.

816
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,360
Anyway, you pair it again.

817
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,160
Okay, it's spared.

818
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,440
Now you have to update your Facebook account or Oculus account.

819
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,080
Actually, if you have an Oculus account, because like you were from the early days, you have

820
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,720
to turn your close accounts to a Facebook account.

821
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,440
Then you get an AR message that does not work on mobile.

822
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,040
You have to go on your laptop, try to log in again, and then it tells you you have to

823
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,160
turn your Facebook account into a metal account.

824
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:02,120
I'm really, like I swear, I'm not making this up.

825
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,960
So you've converted to a metal account, you log in again from the headset, which by the

826
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,080
way, it's going to be the worst experience in your life if you use a password manager.

827
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,880
Because most likely you're going to be taking the headset and be like, everything on your

828
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:18,560
laptop like that, and with the controller trying to type the text.

829
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:21,480
Okay, you've gone through all of that, congrats.

830
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:24,720
Now you have to update the software on the headset.

831
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,440
So it's going to turn off and update and everything.

832
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,800
And then once you do that, you realize actually on the Quest, or some reason, the apps of the

833
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,400
OS and the OS itself are not like updated together.

834
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,800
So now you think, oh, I'm good.

835
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,800
I'm just going to log in with my friends.

836
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,440
And you click like the friend app, which is like the most basic operating system app you

837
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,440
could imagine.

838
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,240
Oh, no, that one needs to be updated separately.

839
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,240
You're going to update that one.

840
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,960
And then you're going to try to join with your friends and you're going to struggle so

841
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,240
hard to join with your friends.

842
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:00,320
Like I don't want to even describe that process to you because like then I'm just going to

843
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:03,160
like hijack the whole course.

844
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,440
Just talk about that.

845
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:09,680
And finally, when you're supposed to be in with your friend, you're all right.

846
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,680
That's it.

847
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,080
Like you can hear each other.

848
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,360
For some reason, just like a regular call, but at least you can hear each other.

849
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:18,880
So now maybe you're going to start, let's say one of my favorite game, show up to the

850
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,880
developers, Dimeo.

851
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,640
You start Dimeo, you can hear each other in the Oculus thing.

852
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:30,960
And then you realize actually, if you're in like a room together with the Oculus thing,

853
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,880
it's a different thing than the multiplayer inside the game, even though both of them use

854
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,000
the Oculus API.

855
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,040
So now you have to get out of the game, get out of the room that you are in the Oculus

856
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,720
sort of social thing, create a new one inside the game.

857
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,000
And then you're like, you have to send the secret code of that room to your friends.

858
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,480
So then you take off the headset and you try to WhatsApp them the good thing.

859
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,480
I'm getting some questions.

860
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,480
Yeah.

861
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,400
And this is why I use the browser.

862
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,760
So when is this going to go away?

863
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:09,320
When can we actually like get into VR without a PhD in computer science?

864
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,320
Exactly.

865
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,800
So when is that going to go away?

866
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,680
Well, that's what I'm trying to do.

867
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,960
And I think that some, here's my guess.

868
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,680
I would say I don't really trust meta to solve it.

869
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:29,320
I don't really trust HTC either or Valve.

870
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,640
I think their track record shows that they're not going to solve for it.

871
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,520
I would say Apple is one that might be able to solve it.

872
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,400
And then my company were trying to solve it.

873
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:43,000
And the answer is the most boring one.

874
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,600
It's going to be a very boring answer.

875
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,400
But the solution is just we have a bunch of developers and we're just trying it all day

876
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:53,000
long and we're just solving those pain points one by one.

877
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,920
And it's long and boring, but polishing the edges off and making it smooth is just long

878
01:02:58,920 --> 01:02:59,920
and boring work.

879
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:00,920
And that's just what we do.

880
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,480
And there's not really any other around that.

881
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:09,800
So yeah, that's, and once this is solved, then yes, certainly once you can just grab

882
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:13,720
the headset, put it on the experience of anything in VR as opposed to like this 35

883
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,560
minutes long process.

884
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,680
Then yeah, I think it's going to brutally change the adoption curve.

885
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:25,760
And we can already see that because the very young ones are spending a lot of time in it.

886
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,760
So that would be my takeaway.

887
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:34,200
Okay, I want to ask a related question.

888
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,200
I have no insight information just where I read from.

889
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,880
I'm going to have a scoble which bring later into the course.

890
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,560
Apple, and I think it's now been delayed with what they were going to do.

891
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:56,160
But their big idea was or rumors were they were developing the super cool AR glasses.

892
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,160
And it's Apple.

893
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,160
So they're going to be awesome, but turns out they're not going to watch them this year.

894
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:07,160
But they were explicitly saying, you know, the way we get to make sure that we're going

895
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,600
to do the mass adoption is AR, not VR.

896
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:15,600
Because I guess you can still see your day, and I'll be more like a pair of glasses, not

897
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,600
a big book headset.

898
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:19,320
What do you think about that?

899
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,800
Yeah.

900
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:32,720
My sort of takeaway on that is, okay, so there's a few things.

901
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:41,600
The first one is I think people love to say that because AR is easier to understand.

902
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,520
They're looking for a compelling narrative.

903
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:52,840
And AR is not most of when people think of AR as kind of like a phone that's trapped

904
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
to your face.

905
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,080
So you can just see your phone open.

906
01:04:56,080 --> 01:05:02,640
So you don't really have to sit down and think it through of like, what is it?

907
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,680
Is a radically new paradigm shift in the way we use computer to understand AR.

908
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,480
It's like pretty easy to understand.

909
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:16,000
So to me, I think the whole debate is actually kind of missing the point.

910
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:20,600
And I know people love to ask me that question, but to me, it feels a little bit like as if

911
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:29,160
in the early 80s, people would ask me, do you think?

912
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:35,960
Do you think, I don't know, like facts or cassettes are going to win?

913
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:41,960
Like do you think we're going to send each other data by printing it out from the computer

914
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:47,040
or do you think we'll keep it in a digital form and put it on a cassette and send it

915
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,040
to each other?

916
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:51,080
Like what do you think is going to be the best way to send data around?

917
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,960
And turn it out, none of those view would have been correct.

918
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:59,960
It's just that those views are easier to translate into what we already know in the real world.

919
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,000
But the one that turned out to be true, it turned out to be none of those.

920
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,120
And so I think here it's kind of like the same thing where when you go and actually

921
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:16,400
ask the people that use it every day, AR or VR, you realize that the line is very blurred.

922
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,600
And that's also my personal belief, which is very soon people are just going to kind

923
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,320
of forget that AR and VR are two different things anyway.

924
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,920
Because some of the things we need to improve the VR experience look a lot like AR.

925
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:34,680
Like for instance, here's one thing that you've certainly experienced.

926
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,880
When you put on the VR headset, like there's my laptop right now for me, the fact that

927
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:44,080
I can just like move and sort of bash into the laptop and break it, that's a big issue.

928
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:49,920
So the way to solve that is to actually be able to, when I get close to the laptop, I

929
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,400
can see that though, and I can see it exactly like in real life.

930
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,960
And there are many ways to that.

931
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,480
You have some displays that are transparent and they can turn on and off the transparency.

932
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,160
You have pass through where you have cameras that we project what happens in the real world

933
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,560
in the VR headset.

934
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:15,040
But my sort of, the TLDR is, I think it's a false dichotomy that people like to make

935
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,720
because they feel slightly disappointed by the adoption curve of VR.

936
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,520
And they say, no, no, no, but the field is interesting.

937
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,680
VR has not taken off as fast as we thought it would.

938
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,400
But actually the thing afterwards is going to take off really fast and that thing is AR.

939
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:36,520
My take is that lack nuance and the real IT is more nuanced and the real IT is actually

940
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:40,960
those things are going to become kind of the same thing.

941
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,440
And we want to really even think of them as separate stuff as time goes on and as adoption

942
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,040
continues to grow.

943
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
Okay.

944
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,040
Thank you.

945
01:07:50,040 --> 01:08:03,120
All right, let's talk about present day adoption now in on cyber in for my view living in this

946
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:12,360
is the one that so far has the most of option.

947
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,600
Okay, people use it to show their NFTs, right?

948
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:24,680
So you can't imagine a more like native set of people than people who have NFTs or can

949
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:30,680
create NFTs and I said, oh, I would like to show my NFT and a matter of words, made out

950
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:31,680
of NFTs.

951
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:40,960
I would even say even within that, the what I've seen is the fastest to jump on it are

952
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,400
artists, creators like the most sophisticated NFT people are even the collectors, right?

953
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,400
They're the creators.

954
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:53,200
And so because I've had many discussions and people have to do this and I'm working

955
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,200
to do this.

956
01:08:54,200 --> 01:09:01,480
I mean, the ones who say yes instantly require no convincing or NFT artists, which you know,

957
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,160
these are like the apex NFT naders.

958
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:09,360
So that part's going well, that seems clear.

959
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:19,000
Where do you see more adoption by less apex digital NFT naders?

960
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,040
What do you think comes next?

961
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,680
Yeah, I think that like one one thing that's very interesting about on saber and how it's

962
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:32,040
got an adoption across like this space specifically is that it's a tool that allows people to

963
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,040
build their own world.

964
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:38,080
And kind of like the analogy I have is like almost like when you were a kid and like you

965
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,600
were imagining these things and imagining yourself building castles at home out of like

966
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,800
pillows or whatnot, like this is kind of the same feeling that you have whenever you curate

967
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,320
the on-saber space, like the idea without saber is to make it as easy as possible for

968
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,320
anyone.

969
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:57,440
You really anyone from a newcomer into the space to a gamer maybe but definitely not

970
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,520
the 74 gamers to go and build worlds.

971
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:05,760
And I think that world building has been popularized by a bunch of labs like the like the sims,

972
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:10,600
for example, or of course, like within the more gamers type of spheres, roadblocks and

973
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,520
Minecraft and whatnot.

974
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:16,280
But it hasn't gone to my mother.

975
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,280
My mother hasn't done world building.

976
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:24,440
I think that on-saber and like what we're trying to achieve is a tool that allows anyone

977
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:28,840
to be able to build worlds and allows for 3D to be kind of democratized across the hands

978
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:34,760
of everyone, not just 3D modelers or gamers that have been able to like play around with

979
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,200
world building at 3D but really anyone at all.

980
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:46,920
So I think that sure like I think that the space, the web 3 space is a lot of early adopters.

981
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:54,280
I think that the fact that artists and collectors but artists even more impressively like a lot

982
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:02,080
of the artists we have in this space today are not like big like are not crypto G's or

983
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:05,440
I come from from like the Bitcoin days or whatnot.

984
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,880
They're not necessarily the biggest technology native people like or but they're able to

985
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,880
go and build with on-saber and curate their experiences.

986
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:22,080
So I think it's very encouraging that they are able to go and create more than it's a

987
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:30,080
worry that like we don't have enough people curating worlds or whatnot.

988
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:34,960
I think what's very interesting about the web 3 spaces that you have people from all

989
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:41,200
boards like you have people that are tech native, that are crypto native, that are not at all,

990
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:45,880
that have always been doing painting, have always been doing something else.

991
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:52,400
It's not like it's easy to pinpoint what kind of tech scales or capabilities like someone

992
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,320
web 3 has.

993
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:59,520
So I think that having adoption early and like that kind of a space just is very telling

994
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:06,120
of where this could go and I am very confident that the moment we are able to go and just

995
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:11,760
make it easier for people outside of web 3 to come in and use those tools and have 3D

996
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:16,520
democratized the way we have for artists and collectors in the web 3 space until now.

997
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,680
That's the moment where we are going to see like more adoption across people.

998
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,680
I think everyone wants to be a world builder.

999
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:28,960
And I don't know anyone that would answer a no to the question would you like to get back

1000
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,400
to the imagination you had whenever you were a kid and building these castles at home with

1001
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:34,400
pills.

1002
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,200
So I think that if we're able to give back this effect and this feeling to people all

1003
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:45,320
across the web 3 space, the moment we have easier tools to onboard other people outside

1004
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:49,440
of web 3, the moment is that we're going to have more adoption clearly.

1005
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:56,360
So I mean, I think it's up to us to number one, communicate better as to like what can

1006
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:02,320
be done with this tool and like these immersive tools on the web.

1007
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:07,840
Like that you can come in build your own world slash universe, share it with anyone with a

1008
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:12,960
link and anyone across the world can come and enjoy it in the same way.

1009
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,520
Now it's up to us to first communicate that and number two just build the right tooling

1010
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:21,960
for people to be able to come in obviously like we don't expect to be hidden behind a

1011
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:27,720
MetaMask connect forever like MetaMask is as much as they've been doing good stuff for

1012
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,240
this space like our is a very hard tool to use for most people.

1013
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,160
Web 3 browsers in general are pretty hard to use for most people and call it a wallet

1014
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:41,200
even is pretty confusing to like the people, my friends and the people who aren't in web

1015
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,200
3.

1016
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,080
So I think it's up to us to just build the right tooling.

1017
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:53,080
Okay, I'm going to switch now to the not the far future.

1018
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,520
I'm pretty sure the far future minimums know given the pace of technological development

1019
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,520
happening.

1020
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,680
I assume the AIs will have taken over by them.

1021
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:04,240
Let's go for the medium future.

1022
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:05,240
It's 2023.

1023
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,720
Let's say 2030.

1024
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:15,880
We'll again start with Charlie in broadly the field we're talking about.

1025
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:18,440
What does the world look like then?

1026
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:21,240
How different is it from today?

1027
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,480
How what should we expect?

1028
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:28,720
I'm well aware all of us are just guessing.

1029
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:37,080
But at least you're in the field working on real problems so your guesses are forged

1030
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:41,680
from some actual experiences as opposed to other people who are just guessing.

1031
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:45,400
So give us your view of 2030.

1032
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:51,200
So I think I was like going back to what Ryan was just saying about the tooling.

1033
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:58,440
Right now we are at the skeleton of infrastructure for Web 3 which you do need to be reasonably

1034
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:02,320
text savvy to make your way through.

1035
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,880
There's a lot of fleshing out to do.

1036
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:12,160
I think by the time we're hitting 2030 that's going to be done to a pretty significant degree.

1037
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:20,260
I mean the way that I think about metaverse is that it's like various digital layers on

1038
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,360
top of the physical world.

1039
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:30,520
And the first kind of key point that we need to move to is where it feels like there isn't

1040
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,760
really a division between physical identity and digital identity, your physical life experience,

1041
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,080
digital life experience.

1042
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:46,040
So I would see 2030 as being like we've reached a point where the technology is good enough,

1043
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:53,400
accessible enough where we're not thinking about the switch from physical into digital,

1044
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,720
especially when it comes to socializing.

1045
01:15:55,720 --> 01:16:02,480
And I think again like going back to the eight to 12 year olds, this is already their reality.

1046
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:08,480
They come home from school and then they're in like audio based, audio based like social

1047
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:11,400
platform by Fortnite for example.

1048
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,920
And they're just like carrying on with their brands from their day at school.

1049
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:20,760
There's no consideration that like I'm switching from physical identity to digital identity.

1050
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:27,040
So I think it's getting to the point where that is really widespread.

1051
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:33,440
I think there'll be a lot of development still to do going back to what Maxime is working

1052
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:39,760
on about when you're in the virtual space, you want to leave it where that has actually

1053
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:42,120
improved your quality of life.

1054
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:46,160
I think that's going to be a lot of work to continue to do that.

1055
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:52,800
But I think the like the clear division will have gone or dissolved by that time.

1056
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Yeah.

1057
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:55,960
Okay.

1058
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:08,360
So I agree it's always a hard to do this kind of prediction because you're kind of sitting

1059
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:14,000
yourself up in a way to look like an idiot because as always you know you miss some stuff

1060
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,080
and then people look back.

1061
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,080
But what I can do.

1062
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,640
It's seven years from now.

1063
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:18,640
We're safe.

1064
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,640
Yeah.

1065
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:20,640
Right.

1066
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,080
So but still like you know we have a company you and I and we're trying to we're investing

1067
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,080
our time and money.

1068
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:32,760
And so when I can answer is well where are we investing and how does like how are like

1069
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,400
what are some believe that for that where we have put some skin the game basically.

1070
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,920
And where do we put some skin in the game is.

1071
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:53,320
You know I was on a flight to the US recently and Stuart is started stuck with me and I

1072
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:58,080
told her I work in VR and told me how my little nephew is super young he's using that

1073
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,320
all day.

1074
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,360
And like that's like that's like a new kind of question that now I have very often with

1075
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:09,280
people where VR is the thing that someone very young in their family is using a lot.

1076
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,280
And it's almost like an alternative to using a console.

1077
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:18,640
And so in seven years from now those 12 to like 15 years old they're going to be old

1078
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:25,320
enough to make their own purchase and and and and buy their own content.

1079
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:29,760
And there's a few things that are going to change that are pretty fundamental.

1080
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,800
And so I think it's useful to share that because I think many people are ignoring that in the

1081
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,800
industry.

1082
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,760
As you know VR makes people sick you get motion sickness or people have a hard time

1083
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:48,360
understanding having like special awareness or that there is a social acceptance issue

1084
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:51,040
where you look weird if you are your headset.

1085
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,960
So what is interesting is all those young people that are going up with VR right now

1086
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:57,480
they won't suffer from those.

1087
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:05,960
And so in 2030 what I see is a generation of now very young adults that are looking for

1088
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,000
better hardware, better software, better experiences.

1089
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:18,520
And the other thing that I see is your the opportunity window in like traditional internet

1090
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,640
is closing very fast.

1091
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:25,720
Like if you're building a nap and putting it on the app store you're competing against

1092
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:30,240
so many people so much money so many momentum so much stuff.

1093
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:35,200
It's like you want to make it here's a company I recently invested in that does dating in

1094
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,200
VR.

1095
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:42,360
Well if you want to do dating in like the real world there is like 20 different apps and

1096
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:47,160
they're all owned by like a few gigantic billion dollar groups and it's like really hard to

1097
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:49,440
compete in the VR world.

1098
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:54,720
There's like a bunch of kids and and they're building a bunch of apps and like that's where

1099
01:19:54,720 --> 01:20:01,520
the new space for opportunity is and so seven years more people opportunity are sort of

1100
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:08,000
clocked up in the traditional digital world and so VR becomes one where you can send those

1101
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
opportunities.

1102
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,040
Now our diet is back into crypto as a way to sort of finish this answer.

1103
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:20,400
This is where crypto and VR are hyper hyper like super relevant to each other where basically

1104
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:33,840
it's going to be super hard to convince Microsoft or EA or or any of those very large game

1105
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,800
publishers to switch to crypto for their games right because what like they have nothing

1106
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,240
like frankly they have nothing to they're already making pretty much as much money as

1107
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:46,080
they possibly can right.

1108
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:52,640
And and the premise of crypto is more so a threat to their business model than something

1109
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,560
that is going to help them.

1110
01:20:55,560 --> 01:21:01,840
It's like Apple like Apple is never going to allow you to build a great great wallet

1111
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:07,480
on iOS like I'm strongly strongly doubt that because crypto to some extent is threatening

1112
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,120
some of what enables Apple to have built this manipulate over time.

1113
01:21:12,120 --> 01:21:17,080
Now if you look at VR people like me where I have the opposite problem we like we've

1114
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:20,760
not built anything we're starting from complete scratch and we're looking for people that

1115
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,720
are super eager super excited.

1116
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:29,240
And if anything if we can find a way to align a large number of people to collaborate on

1117
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:36,040
stuff in a decentralized manner such that we can come up and try to sort of all group

1118
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:40,320
together against those gigantic monopolies of course we're going to welcome it with open

1119
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:42,040
arms right.

1120
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:46,320
And so the other thing that I see for VR is that all of those things that you see on

1121
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:54,400
the fringes of sort of society right where Apple might not have many much stuff to gain

1122
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,360
integrating crypto into the iPhone but I have a lot of things to gain integrating crypto

1123
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:05,000
for it because now all of a sudden I'm attracting users that prior to that I had not any access

1124
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:12,400
to I'm attracting content creators that perked that they had zero access to and and my closing

1125
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,080
thought on this will be the following.

1126
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:22,960
I believe that software paradigm are often enabled by new hardware and those things they

1127
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,960
come sort of hand in hand.

1128
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:31,280
One famous example would be the iMac which we tend to forget is called the iMac because

1129
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:37,000
it stands for internet Macintosh and you have to remember that back then it was the first

1130
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:44,960
computer that shipped with high speeds of modern ports web browser inside the OS it

1131
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:51,320
shipped with web browser inside a ship with an OS level SDK for connecting for writing

1132
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:58,160
apps that connects to the internet and so it helped their hardware right because it gave

1133
01:22:58,160 --> 01:23:03,920
them access to a new growing market and it helped this new set of protocols because now

1134
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,160
they had a dedicated device that embraced them.

1135
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:12,960
In my case it's pretty similar I have a lot to gain by embracing those new standards and

1136
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,160
trying to accrue value with them over time and I think those standards are going to have

1137
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:23,640
a very hard time convincing team cook to make a great crypto experience on the iPhone

1138
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:28,400
and disrupt himself and his own app store but they're going to have a very easy time convincing

1139
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:34,920
me to make my VR headset deeply deeply integrated down to the OS level with crypto to those

1140
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,920
with the micro addictions.

1141
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:38,920
That's very interesting.

1142
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,720
Can I view for how you play 30?

1143
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:49,920
Yeah I think one thing that I would have never guessed is like how much beauty and culture

1144
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:57,480
and belonging would be democratizing I think that my prediction for 2030 is like we build

1145
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:03,720
this new space on the web where people can belong and live culture and find beauty every

1146
01:24:03,720 --> 01:24:04,720
single day.

1147
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,880
I think it's important for us to just keep on focusing on making sure that it's open

1148
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:15,720
and that people can freely come in and leave and not be chained by any type of centralized

1149
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,720
power.

1150
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:22,000
My prediction is that we actually get there through the power of culture because now

1151
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:27,200
that all the creators are on our side I think it's going to be hard for the centralized

1152
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:34,320
systems to go and build as cool experiences or as beautiful experiences online as they

1153
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:43,640
can be by this army of decentralized collaboration this army of really really cool creators from

1154
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:45,520
all across the world.

1155
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:50,440
So my guess is it keeps on going and the decentralized web very soon is just the coolest

1156
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:58,560
place ever to discover content and to live like truly live experiences rather than just

1157
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,360
be consumed by them.

1158
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,440
So I do predict that we'll get there.

1159
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:04,800
There's a lot of people working on it.

1160
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,360
There's a lot of good intentions.

1161
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,360
So I believe.

1162
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:18,920
Okay, I'm going to ask the audience to start sending questions to the UNIC team which will

1163
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:26,600
feed them to me and I'll ask them of you and when you give your questions let us know if

1164
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,520
they are general or for a specific person.

1165
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:34,520
And if you'd like us to address them to someone specifically or just for the panel

1166
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,520
and what we want to answer.

1167
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,840
But I'll wait for those to come in.

1168
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,320
Like I'll stay with Ryan since we're talking.

1169
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:51,280
Like are we going to see ready player one type things in the next 15, 20 years where

1170
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,720
we're I mean genuinely living your way.

1171
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,320
I want to speak to a normal person.

1172
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:59,320
And I say oh none of us right.

1173
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:13,040
They imagine already player one a fully realistic fully immersive full VR economy.

1174
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:15,040
And then they look at what's happening.

1175
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,880
Obviously it doesn't exist right now.

1176
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:21,680
And then there's maybe some disappointed is actually what's happening.

1177
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,680
What's happening now?

1178
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:23,680
Is that going to happen?

1179
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:25,800
Is that even realistic to think about?

1180
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,800
Absolutely.

1181
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:33,640
I think that the hardest thing to get past is probably like culture and having people

1182
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:41,400
want to do or live experiences online rather than just like visit them or like be pretty

1183
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:45,280
much absent while experiencing them.

1184
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:51,160
I think that tech is going to get better at an exponential rate.

1185
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:54,600
And technically for sure I think there's going to be a way to do all these photo realistic

1186
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:59,320
experiences that I've seen examples of things that are pretty mind blowing today already.

1187
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:06,080
So I don't think it's going to be it's that far off or like that hard to do.

1188
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,480
Now how is it going to happen?

1189
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,080
I have no clue.

1190
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:14,200
I think that my position on this has always been to just wait and see what people want

1191
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:16,320
to do with these things.

1192
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:21,960
My perspective is that I'm going to keep on having very strong deep, deep like connection

1193
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:27,600
with the community and what people actually want to do and how they want to experience

1194
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,320
these immersive spaces online.

1195
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,240
And they should just keep on building from there.

1196
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:38,320
So I think that yeah, we could really play one.

1197
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:43,000
Something similar to really play one is something that's pretty much doable in a few years.

1198
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:48,480
But I don't know if it's what people really want to do.

1199
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,640
But I know it's how to ask for the next thing and the next thing.

1200
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:52,640
So we'll see.

1201
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:58,040
I'm going to ask you why we wait for the questions coming because I think this is partially a

1202
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:04,080
hard word topic because basically, and I'll say this for the audience, the most common

1203
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:12,280
thing that I have in my Discord DMs is Ryan yelling at me about how we're making our spaces

1204
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:18,800
to make performance better for normal people.

1205
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:25,840
And this is, I log in on with a fancy graphic card and a big desktop.

1206
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,480
And obviously, Ryan's correct because a lot of people are logging in on phones or on the

1207
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:31,480
computers.

1208
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:36,160
And that's what today's experience is that are nowhere close to being photo-rosed.

1209
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:42,440
They are not in the bad way, but sort of cartoonish, right?

1210
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:43,440
They're never on photo-rulism.

1211
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:47,400
They're never on what people see when they watch the movie.

1212
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:53,000
And we still struggle with performance.

1213
01:28:53,000 --> 01:29:01,360
Is this something that GPUs will take care of it in a decade or are we waiting 30 years

1214
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,360
for this?

1215
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:06,000
Or what does the curve look like?

1216
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Sure.

1217
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:13,040
Okay, that's an excellent question.

1218
01:29:13,040 --> 01:29:17,680
All right, so the short answer is actually yes.

1219
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:22,440
If you just have to be like a little patient and actually we're going to go there and surprisingly

1220
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:23,680
fast.

1221
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:30,560
For the people that are interested in stuff like neural radiance fields, which are a type

1222
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,600
of neural networks for 3D rendering, those are showing incredible results and really fast

1223
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:38,560
and improving really quickly.

1224
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:43,600
And there are a lot of people in the field that like me believe that those might be a

1225
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:45,800
very short path toward photo-realism.

1226
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:55,680
Another thing to note is in general AI slash neural networks enable rendering as vastly,

1227
01:29:55,680 --> 01:30:02,560
and improve the performance of rendering and GPUs are just kind of by themselves getting

1228
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,680
better and better.

1229
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:11,000
So the short answer is you are certainly getting there, that is for sure.

1230
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,720
How long is it going to take?

1231
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:19,920
I would say that within a decade it's going to be pretty wild, how different those things

1232
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,080
are going to look.

1233
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:27,960
Now sort of my, and I'll just, I'll give the short version of it, but my slightly longer

1234
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,080
answer is I would actually question the premise of the question.

1235
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,400
And I will actually say, well, do photo-realism really matter?

1236
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,120
And I would question that a lot.

1237
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:44,480
And I will say the following.

1238
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,960
Picsar is an incredible example of how you can convey emotion, meaning and beauty without

1239
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:55,560
photo-realism, if you just focus your effort on the right stuff.

1240
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:59,600
And there's a story, if people are familiar with me, I have to let's say a million times,

1241
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,360
so they may be super bored about it.

1242
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:07,320
But one simple story is when, it's a little more of a bit at the beginning, but when people

1243
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:10,920
die, the first thing that happens is that their eyes dry off.

1244
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,040
So when they're, because they are dried off, you don't have like any light reflection in

1245
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,480
your eyes.

1246
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:22,600
And as a result of that, the human brain evolved such that when you talk to someone, the first

1247
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:28,040
thing that your brain does is look for those light reflection in their eyes.

1248
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:32,240
Because if they are missing, it means the person is very, very sick or dying or maybe

1249
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,240
already dead.

1250
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:37,600
And so that's a kind of built deep inside of like the back of your brain.

1251
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,640
And thus, if I show you a 3D rendering of a world and you're talking with people, and

1252
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:48,520
I just remove the light reflections in their eyes, it's going to feel really uncanny and

1253
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,120
you're really not going to have a good time.

1254
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:52,240
If you're going to feel really weird.

1255
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:59,480
And those things, I think, are going to have quite a big impact knowing what details are

1256
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:03,760
needed for people to have this sort of comfortable feeling.

1257
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:10,320
But the overall look and photo-realism, I would strongly sort of push back and say that it's

1258
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,480
necessary and I think you are just a good example.

1259
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:22,720
So my overall takeaway is people in the industry, like people making anime or Pixar or to some

1260
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:28,000
extent VR chat, although I think we're still very far from a guru of Kuwaiti Nude, I think

1261
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,720
are kind of proof that photo-realism isn't really needed as much as people think it is

1262
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:38,040
as long as you nail the right details.

1263
01:32:38,040 --> 01:32:44,440
And you might think that, yeah, but all the rooms, they look bad in VR.

1264
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:49,400
Like a virtual cafes, most of them VR, I can't feel good in them, I'm sure with photo-realism

1265
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,000
it would feel better.

1266
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,160
And again, I would, as I said, push back against that once more and say the following, must

1267
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:58,760
cafes that I've been to feel good.

1268
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:05,960
One of the reasons that I feel good in it is because it's built upon literally like hundreds

1269
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:13,200
of years of interior designers iterating on how to make a place feel comfortable.

1270
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,720
And it turns out what makes you comfortable in VR in the real world are two different

1271
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:17,720
things.

1272
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:24,280
And you don't have that kind of like care and experience and for VR where people have just

1273
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:31,160
spent like 20,000 hours trying to find how to make people comfortable in virtual spaces.

1274
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,440
And I think part of the revolution is not necessarily having it be photo-realistic, but

1275
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:40,600
just sort of as an industry learning how to make those spaces more comfortable.

1276
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:45,680
Yeah, no, I mean look for the foreseeable future.

1277
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:48,960
And I'm 24 by 24 pixel pump, right?

1278
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:56,880
So it works fine for emotion and identity and branding.

1279
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,960
But it's also, I want to call this to an objective truth.

1280
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:06,920
It's not like we tested the photo-realistic and decided to do the work, we just can't

1281
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:07,920
do it.

1282
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:11,920
So it's extremely convenient if we concluded the photo-realistic's not any good.

1283
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:15,840
This is like me concluding that thinking of basketball is a good thing.

1284
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,880
I think I was going to dunk a basketball anyway, so it's better that I concluded that

1285
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,560
it's not a good thing, right?

1286
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:31,960
So I do think people wonder about this, right?

1287
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:38,520
And you can say, I don't want to pick someone, I can watch Pixar, but I can also watch a

1288
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:39,520
regular movie.

1289
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,720
Right, we also have regular movies, we don't just have animated movies, right?

1290
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:47,680
I mean, I've question or asked why I'm before this session, as we started this session.

1291
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,960
I actually don't know the answer, I don't think anyone's know the answer.

1292
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:56,440
We could have done this on the campus as an avatar, with voice.

1293
01:34:56,440 --> 01:35:04,240
You know, there'd be three avatars standing in campus talking, four of us, sorry.

1294
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:05,240
Is it better?

1295
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:06,240
Really worse.

1296
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:15,200
That we're projected on a two-dimensional screen and we can see your faces of this,

1297
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,000
I mean, in my mind, but yours.

1298
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I don't know, I don't know the answer, right?

1299
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
I know which one's better.

1300
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,520
And I mean, I'm sure we'll do both, right?

1301
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,960
We'll try both over time.

1302
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:31,320
But it's a very interesting question to me.

1303
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:36,320
And I've thought about this the whole course.

1304
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:41,760
I sit in these sessions and these sessions are Zoom.

1305
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,760
And so we're projecting a Zoom into a 3D world.

1306
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,880
You're like, well, yeah, I'll add to that.

1307
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:56,040
I'll add one thing to that is that, yeah, we have been projected as a 2D on a speed.

1308
01:35:56,040 --> 01:36:00,200
But I've been dancing with a bunch of people in the crowd for a while and like we did a

1309
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,120
bunch of different dances and the flash mode.

1310
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:10,040
So I think my answer to this is that it will only take trying things out with people and

1311
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:12,240
seeing what works and what doesn't work, et cetera.

1312
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:21,280
There's no way to go and get the magic recipe of what is better to do a university course

1313
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,040
in an immersive space.

1314
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:27,000
Maybe in the future, I will get back to this to feel the real emotions of people.

1315
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,600
Maybe we'll have face tracking technologies that do it well.

1316
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:31,600
I don't know.

1317
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:37,280
But I think that our goal and I think our mission of all the people experimenting in

1318
01:36:37,280 --> 01:36:41,840
this is to actually experiment and try to see what does make sense, what does catch

1319
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:47,200
with people, what doesn't catch with people and try to navigate in that way.

1320
01:36:47,200 --> 01:36:49,000
But yeah, if one thing I can say.

1321
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,800
I agree, we're going to expand.

1322
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:56,960
But literally in this box, there's one of us who is not photo-realistic and that works

1323
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:58,440
and three of you were photo-realistic.

1324
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,440
And I was wondering the whole time wondering, which one's better?

1325
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,160
I mean, if not, like I look at you and say, oh, really?

1326
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,760
I wish Maxine would disappear and become an avatar.

1327
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:10,400
I like seeing you.

1328
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:14,560
And so the interesting question, OK, we have a couple of questions that come in.

1329
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,680
The first one I'm sending to Charlie because I don't expect you to have an official answer

1330
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:19,680
to this.

1331
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:20,680
But I think it's a fair question.

1332
01:37:20,680 --> 01:37:24,880
For the general panel, but since you had mentioned all your cousins, I'm going to go

1333
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,680
to you, what about the mental health aspects of eight to 10-year-olds or even 12-year-olds

1334
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:35,360
going directly into VR after school and not doing normal kid things like playing outside?

1335
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,880
Oh, I guess you're...

1336
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:43,080
I mean, yes, it's a big question.

1337
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:50,720
When you're thinking about what's happening in terms of brain chemistry, is there a reason

1338
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:57,400
that they're impacting their mental health negatively by feeling like they have a safe

1339
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,160
space to socially interact so they can be themselves, where they can fully explore their

1340
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:06,200
identity that maybe they might not have outside in a physical environment.

1341
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:09,680
It's like it's such a sweeping generalization.

1342
01:38:09,680 --> 01:38:16,080
I think there's a lot that we've learned from Web2's social media about the impact of Web2

1343
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:24,040
on mental health, especially where your identity and how much people like your identity in

1344
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,560
the digital world becomes kind of currency for status.

1345
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:29,560
We've seen that that's a problem.

1346
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:34,120
We have the opportunity now where we can be building out Web3 with all of the learnings

1347
01:38:34,120 --> 01:38:39,880
of Web2 severely fucked up when it comes to mental health and started to try to address

1348
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:41,520
those problems.

1349
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:54,920
But I think it's a very like a cliched question.

1350
01:38:54,920 --> 01:38:59,880
It's going to be healthier for a child to be participating in X space versus Y space

1351
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,360
because that's how I grew up.

1352
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:07,880
We don't really have the data to support that that's the case.

1353
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:15,480
I certainly know a lot of people in the younger generation who have the opportunity to explore

1354
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:22,320
who they are via an alter ego where they aren't subject to the judgment of their peers, the

1355
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:27,960
fear of being documented and posted on Web2 social media by their peers.

1356
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:35,720
They can really start to experiment in a way that's become progressively harder with photo

1357
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,440
and video based social media.

1358
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:46,880
Arguably being avatar based in a VR space or within a game is healthier because they

1359
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:53,040
get to do all these things that have been becoming more and more socially restrictive

1360
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,040
over time.

1361
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:59,760
I think there's just so much nuance to this that gets missed when it's like, well, I

1362
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,760
grew up like this and I think it's bad that these kids aren't growing up the same way.

1363
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:09,720
Maxim, do you want to comment on this too?

1364
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:13,480
I think I have a very similar perspective.

1365
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:21,720
I will add, I think it's a great question to ask but even more importantly, so as you

1366
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:26,080
know, I'm sure a lot of you in the audience listening to this are considering going into

1367
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,000
crypto.

1368
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I think the people prior to us, people building social media as we've been there in 2000 or

1369
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:44,160
computers in the 90s might have had a path, a path for not having built a very strong

1370
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:50,440
sort of answers to those questions because it was hard to prove that digital world could

1371
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:51,960
have an adverse effect.

1372
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:59,040
I think now that we've seen that actually they can have an adverse effect, no one is

1373
01:40:59,040 --> 01:41:02,480
like, oh, I'm so happy I spent 20 hours on Instagram this week.

1374
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:08,560
Not only do we observe that, I think it's good to be critical and my pushback to being

1375
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:16,760
critical would be very smart to surely most of the greatest cool stuff I've learned and

1376
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,560
discovered about myself and that sort of became core part of who I am in my identity.

1377
01:41:21,560 --> 01:41:23,360
That was through virtual worlds.

1378
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:32,760
So I do act as hard as I can to try to identify what could go wrong and try to fix it but

1379
01:41:32,760 --> 01:41:37,920
I'm not to miss that actually we can fix all of the stuff that might go wrong.

1380
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:42,360
I'm going to also want to comment on this.

1381
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:46,680
I mean, like everything has been said, like they try to do a maxim, I don't know what

1382
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:47,680
I could have really.

1383
01:41:47,680 --> 01:41:52,240
It's interesting because like I hear in my like natural reactions, only that sounds

1384
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:58,720
worrisome and then I also remember when I was a boy guy, there was like all types of anxiety

1385
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:05,040
about video games and I spent my teenage years like every afternoon like my friends

1386
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:10,000
and sometimes you play basketball or whatever and sometimes we just send out my video games

1387
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
all afternoon.

1388
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:18,440
And as far as I can tell, everyone grew up to be a responsible adult and like that was

1389
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:19,440
fine.

1390
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:23,040
Like I mean, but if you listen to what people were saying then, I don't know, it was going

1391
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:28,200
to be the end of the next generation of the total disaster and it was fine.

1392
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:33,600
Like everyone kind of grew up and had a perfectly real life and none of us seemed to have been

1393
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:37,160
negatively affected by video games and now of course the studies come out and say like

1394
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:40,680
maybe actually video games are good for you and you know who knows, not straight or but

1395
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:48,320
like it certainly wasn't anything resembling the panic that for some reason if you're playing

1396
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:53,400
say our PlayStation or what have you, things were going to go wildly wrong in your life

1397
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:54,400
like quite the opposite.

1398
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:55,400
It was a worst mutual.

1399
01:42:55,400 --> 01:43:04,440
Okay, I have another quite general question which is hard but I think it's a good question.

1400
01:43:04,440 --> 01:43:07,920
How do you see the metaverse, we can take this in reverse order and start with Ryan.

1401
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:14,080
How do you see the metaverse impacting society and specifically what steps should be taken

1402
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:16,960
to ensure it is inclusive and equitable for all?

1403
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:20,480
That's a very broad scope to play.

1404
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:23,000
Yeah, it's a very, very good question.

1405
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,840
I think to my point of my prediction within seven years, like I would have never guessed

1406
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,600
that online I would be able to see so much beauty every single day.

1407
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:34,640
I think by scrolling through my Twitter feed or going to on cyber like every single day

1408
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:43,120
I'm confronted with really, really cool stuff, new stuff I didn't know, art, creativity and

1409
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:47,640
I think if anything what the metaverse has managed to accomplish until now for like a

1410
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:53,720
short, a small group of people is to like democratize beauty and to make sure that people can access

1411
01:43:53,720 --> 01:43:56,040
culture and art in a way that they couldn't before.

1412
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:01,960
I think I personally like would access art just once every month, every month and a half

1413
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:07,280
whenever I would go to a gallery or go to like I don't know a museum or whatnot.

1414
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:13,760
But nowadays like every single day like I see new creations being put on on on on on

1415
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,080
on Twitter being shared.

1416
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:17,360
They see news that new artists I didn't know.

1417
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:23,840
I get I get addicted to like certain art styles that I didn't know I liked.

1418
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:28,040
So I think that that's something that one positive that it managed to do.

1419
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:31,600
I think that one thing that we really have to do to make sure that this keeps on going

1420
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:37,040
is accessibility and to make sure that any creative from all across the world or any

1421
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:41,760
art and joy or any person in general because we are all creators by default.

1422
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,840
We are all board creators.

1423
01:44:42,840 --> 01:44:44,680
We are all board collectors.

1424
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:49,560
We're all born art and joyers and like and and I think that the one thing we need to do

1425
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:57,240
is to make sure that the the platforms are as accessible as possible to everyone.

1426
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,800
And that those platforms don't become the exact same platforms we're using now that

1427
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:06,680
are not accessible to everyone and that can love people out of their own accounts, etc.

1428
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:09,280
So I think that's one thing we need to do.

1429
01:45:09,280 --> 01:45:13,280
But overall I think that if we managed to do that through the principles of decentralization,

1430
01:45:13,280 --> 01:45:18,160
we get to a really, really good result that we I start seeing every single day today.

1431
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:23,440
I know a lot of people around me as well are seeing which is the market sizing belonging,

1432
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:26,480
the market sizing culture, the market sizing beauty.

1433
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:31,920
And I think it's really important for humans to be able to to be confronted with that as

1434
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:32,920
well.

1435
01:45:32,920 --> 01:45:33,920
Sorry.

1436
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:43,600
Anyone else want to thank you for that?

1437
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:48,280
Yeah, I can jump in on that.

1438
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:53,960
As I'm working specifically in digital identity, there's a huge way of responsibility when

1439
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,760
we're thinking about like diversity and representation.

1440
01:45:56,760 --> 01:46:02,960
You know, anybody that's building in the like habitat space, identity space.

1441
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:08,760
You know, I think the first thing that's important, you know, where you know, building

1442
01:46:08,760 --> 01:46:15,400
web three now, we already have a much more diverse cross section of builders than we

1443
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:18,280
had in the earlier stages of the internet.

1444
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:22,720
So the first thing that's important thing, especially if you're creating around identity

1445
01:46:22,720 --> 01:46:27,440
is making sure that everybody who is contributing to how that builds out and how you're representing

1446
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:33,840
people that you haven't, you know, you have a very diverse cross section of opinions and

1447
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,120
cultures that are coming into the mix when you, you know, figure out how you're building

1448
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:39,600
that out.

1449
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:45,640
And then the other piece, as Ryan said, you know, everybody is fundamentally creative.

1450
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:52,320
I mean, we've just seen over the last year how AI has started to democratize creativity,

1451
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:53,320
right?

1452
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:59,440
You don't need to be amazing at drawing to become an artist or become a creator.

1453
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:06,160
So I think, you know, for you as a human to like, you know, fulfill the full joy of the

1454
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:10,000
human experience, you need to be able to create stuff.

1455
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:15,960
So there is also a responsibility to democratize access to creation and technology is making

1456
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:19,200
that increasingly easy.

1457
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,680
So I guess those are the two pieces that I'm focused on given that we're building for

1458
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:29,280
identity and we're building for allowing people to easily create and customize their identity.

1459
01:47:29,280 --> 01:47:34,920
Yeah, if I can just finish this stuff, like there's a, there's a quote I read in Rick Ruben's

1460
01:47:34,920 --> 01:47:42,040
book, lately, Rick Ruben is a big, very famous music producer who's worked with people like

1461
01:47:42,040 --> 01:47:46,520
it was was that the inception of Dev Jam in the 90s and worked with every single artist

1462
01:47:46,520 --> 01:47:47,520
you can think of.

1463
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:52,960
And like there's one quote of his that really, really struck by me and like my mission on

1464
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,360
with on saver and I'll read it now.

1465
01:47:56,360 --> 01:48:00,280
Regardless of whether or not we're formally making art, we're all living as artists.

1466
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:04,840
We perceive, perceive filter and collect data, then curate and experience for ourselves and

1467
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:07,320
others based on this information set.

1468
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:12,160
Whether we do this consciously or unconsciously by the mere fact of being alive, we are active

1469
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,000
participants in the ongoing process of creation.

1470
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,320
And I think that's really, really important as like to what we're doing in web three and

1471
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:25,560
how we're able to just like bring this flame of creativity back to every single person.

1472
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:30,560
That's the participant.

1473
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:31,560
Great.

1474
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:37,560
I have a question that I don't know what an answer to what I feel professionally obligated

1475
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:38,560
to ask.

1476
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,560
Maxine, what is your headshot coming out?

1477
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:44,560
Jane from the group.

1478
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:45,560
Okay.

1479
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:49,560
Unfortunity, we're enough communicating data community yet.

1480
01:48:49,560 --> 01:48:56,560
However, you can email me and I'm adding people to our I'll find better at least all the time.

1481
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:02,400
Write me a short blurb about yourself where you come out of your and I'll do my best to

1482
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,560
add you to one of our spots.

1483
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:08,560
There's a second part of the question I suspect we're going to be answering and I'll ask

1484
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:09,560
you also.

1485
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,560
Does your head said have a name yet?

1486
01:49:11,560 --> 01:49:12,560
What, sorry?

1487
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:14,560
Does it have a name yet?

1488
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,560
Oh, a name yet.

1489
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:21,560
You can follow me on Twitter, I'll be announcing stuff pretty soon.

1490
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:26,560
But sorry again, we've hired too many people from Apple and so we took that from them which

1491
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:29,560
I tried to be here to tell you about all the stuff.

1492
01:49:29,560 --> 01:49:36,560
Absolutely respect that but I had to shoot my shot on behalf of the studio audience.

1493
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:39,560
There's a question that I think I can answer.

1494
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:47,560
You can expect more avatars as NFTs for all integration and I think the answer is yes but

1495
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,560
probably I don't know.

1496
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:57,560
Two or three months away on various things so we're working on it and expect cool things

1497
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:58,560
happening there.

1498
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:01,560
Is that, we're here with that Ryan as an answer?

1499
01:50:01,560 --> 01:50:03,560
Yeah, totally, totally.

1500
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:06,560
Again, as for everything we do, everything is experimental.

1501
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:12,560
We very often do QA in broad and so this was one of the examples where we just pushed

1502
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:19,560
avatars as quick as we could with a very optimized system so on the web right now we could render

1503
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:24,560
like a thousand avatars next to each other on an iPhone.

1504
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:31,560
We had to just have one to be able to achieve that feat and then be able to optimize more

1505
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,560
to be able to add more I think within next two months yeah we'll be able to have many

1506
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:42,560
more avatars and truly have like identity in the form of avatars within Unsamer.

1507
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:52,560
Okay, we are at time so I wanted to thank all three of our panelists for taking the time

1508
01:50:52,560 --> 01:51:03,560
to meet with us, very much appreciate your insights.

1509
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:12,560
We will turn this into an NFT soon and I think soon beyond that soon we'll have our better

1510
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:19,560
organizational model and how we display all these both on the campus in the thirties case

1511
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:25,560
and also how people can find them on the web because like this panel there have been a lot

1512
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:30,560
of great panels and sessions and I think these are great things for people to watch whether

1513
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:36,560
they were here today at specifically this time and so we want we think that's an important

1514
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,560
part of helping to educate the space so I appreciate you doing that.

1515
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:45,560
We'll let you know once they're minted you can share the music we'll find a model where

1516
01:51:45,560 --> 01:51:50,560
the content comes if people can open mint them into their wallet if you want to keep this

1517
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:56,560
for austerity sake making it immutable so you can show your grandchildren how wrong your

1518
01:51:56,560 --> 01:52:07,560
predictions for 2031 and a model what we want so thank you very much.

1519
01:52:07,560 --> 01:52:08,560
Thank you.

1520
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:09,560
Thank you so much.

1521
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:10,560
There was awesome.

1522
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:12,560
Thanks so much.

1523
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,560
Yeah thank you for having us does a pleasure.
