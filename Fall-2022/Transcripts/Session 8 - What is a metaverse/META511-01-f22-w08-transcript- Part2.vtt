WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.720
All right.

00:20.720 --> 00:27.240
Hello everyone and welcome back for today's Metaverse Panel.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.160
As you learn, it is hopefully people have found the right location.

00:30.160 --> 00:33.080
We are not in quote unquote sector zero today.

00:33.080 --> 00:36.400
We're on the very very beginnings of the Metaverse camp.

00:36.400 --> 00:42.600
There's a big amphitheater and an outdoor park course that people jump around on.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.600
We don't have classrooms or auditoriums or other things yet.

00:47.600 --> 00:51.600
We do have a nice place to pick around.

00:51.600 --> 01:01.400
Today we're joined with three important builders broadly, or I would call in the Metaverse ecosystem.

01:01.400 --> 01:08.840
What we're going to do today is learn what they're doing, ask them easier or harder questions

01:08.840 --> 01:15.440
as they know, and then find out what our future is going to look like.

01:15.440 --> 01:20.200
As it's not just what's going to happen this year, I'd like to know what's going to happen

01:20.200 --> 01:30.200
in 2035 so I can get mentally prepared for launching myself into the Metaverse.

01:30.200 --> 01:35.720
The interesting here are the points of view of this week.

01:35.720 --> 01:42.680
Then as always, at the end we will have some time for questions from the audience.

01:42.680 --> 01:52.680
By all means keep track of what you'd like to ask and we'll cover it at the end.

01:52.680 --> 01:59.280
Before we get into specifics, I think it is important that we give our guests the opportunity

01:59.280 --> 02:01.280
to properly introduce themselves.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.520
They are all three very interesting people.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.040
The backgrounds and they are working on interesting projects.

02:08.040 --> 02:14.280
We're going to go through one by one, learn a little bit about how they ended up here

02:14.280 --> 02:20.200
working on these cutting edge topics and what specifically they're working on right now.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.960
We'll do that and we'll get to the questions.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.120
Let's start with the first.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.440
Great to be here.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.440
Thanks for having me.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.520
A little on my background.

02:30.520 --> 02:31.520
I'm Charlie.

02:31.520 --> 02:35.440
I'm the founder of Restless and Charlie Cohen fashion brand.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.720
I started the Charlie Cohen brand back in 2012.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.960
Although it was a physical fashion brand, everything was very much based around internet

02:45.960 --> 02:46.960
culture.

02:46.960 --> 02:54.880
Throughout my fashion degree, which had been the prior four years, I was very involved

02:54.880 --> 03:01.640
as a blogger and involved in a lot of digital discourse.

03:01.640 --> 03:06.800
I was well aware by that time that my digital identity was as valuable, if not more valuable,

03:06.800 --> 03:09.120
to me than my physical identity.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.760
It was something that I really wanted to bring into physical collections.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.360
Whether that was certain activations around each collection, what kind of platforms we

03:18.360 --> 03:23.480
could build for having a conversation around the themes for each collection, plugging into

03:23.480 --> 03:25.960
meme culture and so on.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.480
Then after a couple of years, I'd say around 2015, we started getting to experiment with

03:30.480 --> 03:36.960
AR and BR as well and being able to take this digital storytelling to another level and

03:36.960 --> 03:42.600
really start creating alternative experiences to traditional fashion events like fashion

03:42.600 --> 03:45.360
weeks, like typical lookbook shoots and so on.

03:45.360 --> 03:50.320
It was a much more interesting way to connect with our community, who very much weren't

03:50.320 --> 03:53.360
at these shows on the traditional fashion calendar.

03:53.360 --> 03:56.920
2019, we started getting to work with the gaming industry.

03:56.920 --> 04:04.440
That was really the first time I got deep into designing digital wearables and having

04:04.440 --> 04:07.240
digital physical crossover.

04:07.240 --> 04:11.520
Going into 2020, we were in a great position for the pandemic where we could create these

04:11.520 --> 04:17.080
virtual immersive story worlds and retail experiences and digital collections as well.

04:17.080 --> 04:23.600
Off the back of that, we ended up working with a lot of big brands like Pokemon, Hello Kitty,

04:23.600 --> 04:29.120
Assassin's Creed, Reebok and started getting to do all of these proof of concept experiments

04:29.120 --> 04:32.760
around digital and interoperability.

04:32.760 --> 04:38.360
We weren't tackling interoperability from a blockchain perspective at that time.

04:38.360 --> 04:43.080
We were just integrating with lots of different virtual social environments and game environments

04:43.080 --> 04:48.560
where there'd be a version of an asset that was available in each of those spaces.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.600
It helped to prove out the interest in interoperable identity, but it was still a pretty convoluted

04:55.600 --> 04:57.440
experience.

04:57.440 --> 05:01.800
As a user, you'd have to go into each of these individual environments, go through a separate

05:01.800 --> 05:06.800
checkout flow, and then from a licensing side, everything would have to be contracted out

05:06.800 --> 05:09.040
separately as well.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.920
It was a nice idea, but certainly not scalable.

05:12.920 --> 05:18.240
I went down the NFT rabbit hole as I was searching for some kind of tech solution to streamline

05:18.240 --> 05:22.880
things, because the goal was to be able to have one central hub.

05:22.880 --> 05:27.760
You could buy something once and then be able to take it into you as many places as you wanted.

05:27.760 --> 05:33.400
As I got more and more involved in that space and that community, one, I realized that this

05:33.400 --> 05:38.120
was a huge issue that everybody was talking about and trying to figure out.

05:38.120 --> 05:44.600
Two, the ethos of Web3 and decentralization really resonated with me.

05:44.600 --> 05:50.080
My own challenges about being involved in traditional fashion industry, traditional creative industry,

05:50.080 --> 05:52.120
the ethical implications of that.

05:52.120 --> 05:59.760
I really liked the idea of being able to be part of building something that could kickstart

05:59.760 --> 06:03.600
a new generation of creatives and designers.

06:03.600 --> 06:11.120
I shifted my focus from the brand and started building Restless at the beginning of 2021.

06:11.120 --> 06:18.920
The main premise of Restless is it's an easy way for any creator or brand to easily build

06:18.920 --> 06:24.000
and customize interoperable wearables that can plug into both open metaverse and traditional

06:24.000 --> 06:28.240
game environments as well as have physical counterparts.

06:28.240 --> 06:29.240
Excellent.

06:29.240 --> 06:35.800
Matsu, do you want to tell us a little bit about your background?

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
Sure.

06:36.800 --> 06:41.800
Thank you for having me.

06:41.800 --> 06:46.800
I'm super happy to be here.

06:46.800 --> 06:51.880
I'll tell you a little bit about myself and then it will just make sense what the company

06:51.880 --> 06:54.240
that I'm building is.

06:54.240 --> 07:00.880
I've been into VR now for something like the past seven years probably.

07:00.880 --> 07:08.120
A little bit about myself, I grew up in the countryside of friends in the middle of nowhere.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.800
I was the only teenager in my village.

07:10.800 --> 07:18.760
So mostly I grew up with books and computers and they made most of my friends online.

07:18.760 --> 07:25.120
When I was probably around 14 years old, the Oculus from Palmer Locky came out.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.720
That was a very big deal back then.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.080
My first thought was this is amazing.

07:31.080 --> 07:35.720
If I could have this device, I could hang out with my own layer friends.

07:35.720 --> 07:39.760
Problem is I was a teenager so I couldn't afford to buy a VR headset.

07:39.760 --> 07:44.720
If you imagine it was like a thousand bucks at the time.

07:44.720 --> 07:50.200
So I thought maybe I can build one by myself and I spend a more year building this VR headset

07:50.200 --> 07:57.320
from scratch and basically ended up building the same thing as an Oculus but much cheaper.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.240
I got super lucky.

07:59.240 --> 08:03.800
There was at the time no resources on how to build a VR headset so I sort of had to figure

08:03.800 --> 08:05.800
all of that by myself.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.200
And in doing so I did things slightly differently.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.880
And you might even say in some very specific aspects slightly better than Oculus.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.880
So I did that at the time.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.680
Facebook heard about it.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.520
They flew me over to the US.

08:22.520 --> 08:27.000
I got to spend time with the executive team.

08:27.000 --> 08:32.160
Batman Binstow, their chief architect, loved their engineering team, loved the passionate

08:32.160 --> 08:33.800
those people were about the VR.

08:33.800 --> 08:40.440
But realized the leadership was in my opinion I felt like those people were coolest about

08:40.440 --> 08:43.440
the VR and about where VR was headed.

08:43.440 --> 08:49.960
And so I decided to take everything I'd built and open source it all.

08:49.960 --> 08:56.440
The hardware, the firmware, the software, the algorithm, pretty much everything.

08:56.440 --> 08:57.560
And dropped out of high school.

08:57.560 --> 09:01.160
I was something like 15 years old at the time.

09:01.160 --> 09:08.840
And dedicated the following four years, retrink to work on the edge of research in the VR.

09:08.840 --> 09:14.240
Both from the hardware and software perspective and game engines and graphics and art.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.000
And as many things we can talk about later.

09:18.000 --> 09:26.400
And as a side note, if some of you are familiar with it back then I wrote one of the first

09:26.400 --> 09:29.520
rendering plugin for Unity.

09:29.520 --> 09:33.480
Which is used to make up half of the video games in the world.

09:33.480 --> 09:39.600
And so I created some stuff that are still being used by people today in terms of like

09:39.600 --> 09:42.680
the actual engine of how VR works.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.160
So that was pretty nice.

09:44.160 --> 09:49.920
And we have a fantastic relationship with Unity people in general.

09:49.920 --> 09:55.040
And the turning point came, I'm sorry maybe I'm taking a little bit.

09:55.040 --> 09:56.280
Here's a point to this story.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.120
The turning point came.

09:58.120 --> 10:03.960
That was the Quest 2, the VR headset that I'm sure you're all familiar with.

10:03.960 --> 10:08.680
And that VR headset was, it was a before and after.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.720
Everyone bought that VR headset.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.520
They all played with it for about a week, right.

10:14.520 --> 10:19.280
Trying to beat my score at bit saver or whatever that is.

10:19.280 --> 10:24.280
And usually what you'll find is that after one week.

10:24.280 --> 10:26.000
People just stop using it.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.720
And they take it and they put it on a shelf behind them.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.560
And just collecting dust and they just stop using it, right.

10:33.560 --> 10:38.760
And the truth is the VR biggest use case is people are going to be using it for a week

10:38.760 --> 10:41.000
and they're going to put it on a shelf.

10:41.000 --> 10:46.760
And then maybe once or twice a year a friends visit or family visit and they're going to

10:46.760 --> 10:50.440
be like, oh yeah, you want to try it out and you're going to take it out and have your

10:50.440 --> 10:51.720
friends try it.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.280
And that's pretty much it.

10:53.280 --> 10:57.480
Okay, so that was VR back then.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.720
To this day VR still has suffered from those problems.

11:00.720 --> 11:06.800
And it turns out that I have very strong conviction as far as why there is the case.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.320
And we can go very deep into that.

11:09.320 --> 11:14.800
But I'm essentially convinced that as of right now the technology is already there to make

11:14.800 --> 11:17.280
a VR headset that people use every day.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.040
The designers are already there.

11:19.040 --> 11:23.560
They're storytelling the marketing, all of those things could be made.

11:23.560 --> 11:26.680
I just think that meta is not the right company to do it.

11:26.680 --> 11:34.160
And so I went out there, explained exactly how to do it to other companies.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.840
You know, for instance, Unity, right.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.440
I love to make people from Unity.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.600
I went to them and explained to them, hey, this is how you make VR so that it does not

11:42.600 --> 11:44.800
make people sick anymore.

11:44.800 --> 11:50.240
And Unity said, that sounds awesome, go and ask someone else to build it.

11:50.240 --> 11:51.760
I was like, okay, sure.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.160
So then I go and ask NVIDIA because they use some of my stuff as well.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.760
And NVIDIA says, that sounds awesome.

11:57.760 --> 11:58.760
Go and ask Qualcomm.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.440
So I go and talk to Qualcomm and you just did basically no one wanted to build it.

12:03.440 --> 12:09.400
And so at the time I reached out to a novel, a revicant, which might be familiar with

12:09.400 --> 12:14.800
is an investor in crypto and metaverse and many stuff.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.040
And novel convinced me to build my own company.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.800
And so I just started this company and said, if no one wants to build it, I'm going to

12:21.800 --> 12:25.080
build it myself.

12:25.080 --> 12:29.840
And we started off really focused on software, then started expanding into the hardware part

12:29.840 --> 12:30.840
of it.

12:30.840 --> 12:35.960
And now we're starting to go deep into the design and marketing of that whole thing.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.320
Nothing that we've done is public yet, but I'm super happy to talk about it.

12:39.320 --> 12:41.320
So we've been very stealthy.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.800
And just so you have an understanding of where the company is at.

12:44.800 --> 12:49.800
So we were based in Mountain View, California.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.680
We've raised quite some money.

12:51.680 --> 12:59.000
We're actually the best funded company in VR hardware currently.

12:59.000 --> 13:04.480
And we're a super nice team that I'm very proud of, people from Apple, people from Sony

13:04.480 --> 13:06.560
and people from metal.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.200
And some of those people that worked on stuff that you've seen before, some of those people

13:10.200 --> 13:17.840
you've even seen on stage before, as those people were on stage during Apple's keynotes.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.200
And so yeah, that's what we do today.

13:19.200 --> 13:20.880
That's what I work on.

13:20.880 --> 13:29.800
And I guess as a tiny bit more piece of a context, I come very much from hardware, but

13:29.800 --> 13:33.360
sort of then graduated into trying to become much better at software.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.640
And the past, I would say here, also, has been really about design and marketing.

13:37.640 --> 13:43.320
And so I guess where my perspective might be interesting for a question is, I have a pretty

13:43.320 --> 13:49.280
good understanding of what it takes for VR to go mainstream, but also the history of

13:49.280 --> 13:51.600
host of goes mainstream.

13:51.600 --> 13:57.120
And it might be interesting to talk about some of my perspective on why is it that some

13:57.120 --> 14:03.360
things like crypto or VR might seem like they are experiencing what some people might call

14:03.360 --> 14:04.680
the winter.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.480
And how do you get through that?

14:06.480 --> 14:09.040
And maybe I can bring some historical perspective on that.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.640
So that's me in a nutshell.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.640
Fantastic.

14:12.640 --> 14:17.920
And Brian, you're talking about yourself and on the shoulder.

14:17.920 --> 14:24.120
After this introduction is pretty hard for me to be able to tell myself.

14:24.120 --> 14:30.440
Yeah, I mean, the story of On-Samper and myself is really the story of a kid who wanted to

14:30.440 --> 14:32.440
do something useful in VR3.

14:32.440 --> 14:37.680
I think I started getting interested in 2krypto when I was about 12 or 13.

14:37.680 --> 14:41.080
A long time ago.

14:41.080 --> 14:47.000
And I didn't directly get into crypto, but got into really admired the tech.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.960
Took me about 10 years to finally get him and build a product in it.

14:50.960 --> 14:55.120
In the meantime, I was building product and I left a program and such.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.760
My dad is in the art world.

14:56.760 --> 15:01.120
So I had been around art creation and art and contacts with artists, et cetera, for my

15:01.120 --> 15:02.440
whole life.

15:02.440 --> 15:07.400
When mid 2020, I find out about NFTs and directly it clicks.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.560
I directly noticed what it can do for creatives, what it can do for the relations that creatives

15:12.560 --> 15:14.920
have with their collectors.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.800
Where in the art world, there's a very central assistant for people to go and get the approval

15:19.800 --> 15:22.480
of dealers and galleries and whatnot.

15:22.480 --> 15:28.120
I thought Web3 and NFTs could come into free up creatives all around the world.

15:28.120 --> 15:33.520
Any kid like myself from Morocco and I know so many examples would be able to go and sell

15:33.520 --> 15:38.480
stuff on foundation and whatnot and make money without ever having to kiss the hand

15:38.480 --> 15:40.600
of a random art dealer in Morocco.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.880
So I thought that was pretty interesting.

15:42.880 --> 15:47.600
But at the time when I started to look at this, there were very few platforms that would

15:47.600 --> 15:49.480
allow people to story tell with art.

15:49.480 --> 15:54.800
I think at the time the biggest platforms were Decentraland and CryptoVoxels in the immersive

15:54.800 --> 15:59.120
space and then the other options for curation would be in 2D.

15:59.120 --> 16:04.320
Of course, adding a dimension makes it easier for people to curate art and to enjoy art.

16:04.320 --> 16:09.920
So we needed a proper immersive experience or immersive experience platform for people

16:09.920 --> 16:17.560
to showcase and discover art and to visualize Web3, the culture in Web3 in a sense.

16:17.560 --> 16:22.440
But there were none and the only way to get into curation in Web3 at the time was to go

16:22.440 --> 16:29.160
buy a lamp on Decentraland and hire an architect and do a bunch of very redundant actions just

16:29.160 --> 16:30.640
to be able to exhibit art.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.720
Most people were actually going and buying a lamp on these platforms to do exactly those

16:33.720 --> 16:35.400
functions.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.600
And so I went and thought, hey, there is definitely a use case somewhere here where people want

16:40.600 --> 16:46.560
to showcase their assets in immersive spaces and connect around immersive spaces.

16:46.560 --> 16:49.440
I do not know what this metaverse is ever going to be.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.960
I do not know what exactly people are going to want to do, but I know I can have a link

16:53.960 --> 16:58.680
with a bunch of people right now that are early adopters that want to experience with

16:58.680 --> 17:00.160
these technologies.

17:00.160 --> 17:04.000
And so the idea was we're going to go and build this simplest product for people to

17:04.000 --> 17:07.720
place and discover assets in immersive spaces.

17:07.720 --> 17:13.440
And from there, try to listen as much as possible for the community's feedback and what people

17:13.440 --> 17:18.040
want to do in these immersive spaces to just build layer after layer after layer for something

17:18.040 --> 17:19.760
that makes sense.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.760
What we're doing today.

17:20.760 --> 17:25.840
And in OM, for example, like I would have never guessed when I was in this very same

17:25.840 --> 17:30.760
bedroom at my parents house in Morocco when I started the company two years ago.

17:30.760 --> 17:35.040
But again, I think the one thing that we've had within the team is that we've always been

17:35.040 --> 17:39.400
very open as to what this could be, what the metaverse landscape is going to be, what

17:39.400 --> 17:42.040
the immersive web should be.

17:42.040 --> 17:47.240
And we just kept on listening to our community, building another layer and building another

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
functionality.

17:48.240 --> 17:55.160
So I think the story of a one-siber as a company that's fully bottomed up, that listens to

17:55.160 --> 18:01.480
people, that will always go in and find the latest piece of feedback that our users want

18:01.480 --> 18:06.520
and will go in and implement that so that we end up having a product that truly resonates

18:06.520 --> 18:12.560
with real humans rather than just having ideas about what an immersive world should be and

18:12.560 --> 18:15.800
just developing it from the ground up until it's ready.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.560
So yeah, that's pretty much me and my story.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.400
Okay, this was fantastic.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.160
And I'll have about 11 million questions.

18:25.160 --> 18:30.200
Let me start with some specific questions addressed to specific people.

18:30.200 --> 18:33.000
And then later we'll do the more integrative ones.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.120
And again, I want to start with Charlie.

18:35.120 --> 18:40.920
I want to give you the opportunity to address the following thing that I have heard one

18:40.920 --> 18:43.800
billion times.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.640
I don't want digital wearables.

18:45.640 --> 18:47.280
Why do I need digital wearables?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.520
I want real clothes.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.600
I want a real purse.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.920
Why would I spend money on that stuff?

18:53.920 --> 18:58.000
Obviously, this is not NFT people.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.560
Let's call it normal people.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.560
Right?

19:00.560 --> 19:03.440
So when I've had this discussion, what are NFTs good for?

19:03.440 --> 19:07.760
Not saying different things, but one of the things I always say is digital wearables.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.040
And like 80% of the time, this is the answer.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.800
Can I give my response with my guesses?

19:13.800 --> 19:16.480
You probably have a better, more nuanced thought than this.

19:16.480 --> 19:19.200
So the floor is yours.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.440
Sure.

19:20.440 --> 19:28.320
So I think usually my first question in response to that mentality is, have you ever used a

19:28.320 --> 19:29.320
profile picture?

19:29.320 --> 19:31.760
Have you ever curated an Instagram feed?

19:31.760 --> 19:36.040
Have you ever used a filter on social media?

19:36.040 --> 19:40.360
Generally the answer to at least one of those things, if not all three of them, is yes.

19:40.360 --> 19:45.280
And then we can start digging into, well, clearly you care about your digital identity

19:45.280 --> 19:47.560
to some extent.

19:47.560 --> 19:55.920
And as technology develops and your digital identity is represented increasingly in 3D

19:55.920 --> 20:03.880
spaces and as an avatar, then wearables are going to be the equivalent to changing your

20:03.880 --> 20:07.480
profile picture or curating your Instagram feed.

20:07.480 --> 20:16.520
And then also is always nice to point out the $60 billion skins industry within traditional

20:16.520 --> 20:18.800
gaming as well.

20:18.800 --> 20:28.640
There is a complete precedent for a whole generation, two generations, the value that

20:28.640 --> 20:33.880
digital identity enough to be investing heavily in game wearables.

20:33.880 --> 20:39.360
And this doesn't even have the functionality of NFTs where you own it, where you can take

20:39.360 --> 20:47.560
it into other spaces, where it's, you know, often you can't resell it for actual money.

20:47.560 --> 20:53.440
And NFT wearables are taking something that is already a massive industry and making it

20:53.440 --> 20:57.320
even more valuable and even more scalable.

20:57.320 --> 21:04.880
But I think usually the key is just like focusing in on digital identity, which is something

21:04.880 --> 21:10.440
that most people have been participating in for the last couple of decades.

21:10.440 --> 21:15.040
And then it starts to click a little bit more why sometime in the future they might

21:15.040 --> 21:17.840
be investing in that in a slightly different way.

21:17.840 --> 21:18.840
Okay.

21:18.840 --> 21:22.160
So I agree with everything you said, obviously.

21:22.160 --> 21:24.280
Now what if someone says that's fine.

21:24.280 --> 21:32.120
Of course I have a profile picture on Instagram or LinkedIn or Twitter and they might even

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
be different.

21:33.120 --> 21:39.760
But I didn't spend money on it and I put one once to like I'm changing it all the time.

21:39.760 --> 21:45.600
Is this something in gaming, I hear you on gaming, but that's like I don't know if people

21:45.600 --> 21:46.960
will play a lot of games.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.920
Is this just something for people with games?

21:48.920 --> 21:51.720
I'm a normal person.

21:51.720 --> 21:54.480
I have a social media presence.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.520
I'm not a big gamer.

21:56.520 --> 22:00.400
Is this just something that's not for me or is it going to be different?

22:00.400 --> 22:10.800
Well, I guess then it comes to the concept of fashion and subculture and community full

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
stops.

22:11.800 --> 22:16.680
It's like, have you ever done anything within the physical world, made a physical purchase

22:16.680 --> 22:20.080
because in some way it connected you more to a community.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.680
In some way it was a flex.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.960
Have you ever bought a pair of limited edition sneakers?

22:24.960 --> 22:28.200
What was the reason behind that?

22:28.200 --> 22:35.800
And then it's sort of taking that and like, okay, well, if the only place or the primary

22:35.800 --> 22:41.760
place that you're going to be connecting with that community or showcasing that flex is

22:41.760 --> 22:46.920
in digital, then isn't the digital version of that asset actually more valuable?

22:46.920 --> 22:57.000
I think the first thing, why are you buying some combination of why you buy a limited edition

22:57.000 --> 23:01.400
sneaker and what your profile pictures and why it changes and the skins somewhere in

23:01.400 --> 23:04.200
there is the reality.

23:04.200 --> 23:16.600
I think there is probably some room for us as a community to find a shorter, piffier way

23:16.600 --> 23:19.600
to get this across.

23:19.600 --> 23:25.320
I don't know why the team Bitcoin figured this out right now to talk about Bitcoin.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.920
You're holding it, digital gold or what have you.

23:27.920 --> 23:35.720
There's probably something there because it's a very common response on this topic.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.280
Practically it'll probably just happen naturally.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.280
Maybe we can accelerate.

23:40.280 --> 23:45.640
Anything you want to add there, should I go to McSee?

23:45.640 --> 23:47.640
I think we can go over to my team.

23:47.640 --> 23:48.640
Hi, McSee.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.840
Let me make sure I understood this correctly.

23:50.840 --> 23:56.400
You went around to all the biggest technology companies in the world all like multiple tens

23:56.400 --> 24:01.040
or hundreds of billions of dollars or trillions and you have concluded none of them know how

24:01.040 --> 24:03.240
to build a concept so you're going to build your own.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.240
Did I understand this correctly?

24:05.240 --> 24:08.040
You can say that way.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.840
I'm summarizing it the way I understood it.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.480
You were going to build a better headset.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.400
This is the takeaway.

24:15.400 --> 24:22.200
I think we at the company, it's not many people.

24:22.200 --> 24:26.080
I think we have a shot at building a better headset.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.720
I mean that's in the very holistic sense.

24:29.720 --> 24:37.200
I think one critical aspect of, as I'm sure you realize actually being in crypto, is it's

24:37.200 --> 24:41.400
certainly about the product, it's also about the messaging of the product and your ability

24:41.400 --> 24:45.800
to convey that and to educate people about it.

24:45.800 --> 24:52.280
And yeah, I'm happy to be more specific but I think the way you broke it down is it would

24:52.280 --> 24:54.880
be accurate, although we don't say it like that.

24:54.880 --> 25:00.760
Right, of course not because you're modest and appropriate.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.960
What does a better headset mean?

25:04.960 --> 25:11.760
Facebook has put, I don't know how many billions of dollars into a headset.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.760
Okay, well that's cool.

25:12.760 --> 25:13.760
I'm a smart guy.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
Mine's going to be better.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.960
Why is it going to be better?

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
How is it going to be better?

25:17.960 --> 25:23.760
What's missing today that when your headset comes out, will be much happier?

25:23.760 --> 25:24.760
Sure.

25:24.760 --> 25:34.800
I think that's a fascinating question and one way I'll try to answer is rather than going

25:34.800 --> 25:42.400
into the very specific difference between my headset and their headset, maybe what I

25:42.400 --> 25:48.680
can try doing and if it's interesting, we can keep pulling on that thread, is talk a

25:48.680 --> 25:54.200
little bit about the cultural differences between the people making decisions at the

25:54.200 --> 26:03.120
Metap or Apple and the people that I'm a part of and that most people in this sort of metaverse

26:03.120 --> 26:08.840
movement are part of and where are the cultural differences between them.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.880
And the reason for that is one of my belief is, you know, if you look at a company like

26:13.880 --> 26:22.480
Google, Google has tried many times to compete with Apple in the smartphone market and Google

26:22.480 --> 26:27.400
has infinite amount of money and yet they're not able to compete with Apple, right?

26:27.400 --> 26:33.160
Like their phone are setting much less units than the iPhone.

26:33.160 --> 26:37.160
So they're not able to compete with the iPhone despite having infinite amount of money.

26:37.160 --> 26:42.920
So it means that there's something else that Apple has that Google does not have and that

26:42.920 --> 26:49.320
thing is a set of belief and that thing is essentially culture.

26:49.320 --> 26:53.880
And so rather than telling you exactly the specs in terms of difference, I think it's

26:53.880 --> 26:58.720
worth it to talk about the cultural differences between Metap or Apple and those companies

26:58.720 --> 27:00.200
and us.

27:00.200 --> 27:10.600
And if I try to break down the cultural difference, the most important point and I think that

27:10.600 --> 27:18.120
if you have one thing to take away from me, it would be that it's the fact that to those

27:18.120 --> 27:28.160
people, virtual worlds have a zero sum game relationship with the real world.

27:28.160 --> 27:34.400
So it essentially means is that to those people, the time you spend in a virtual world is time

27:34.400 --> 27:35.840
lost in real life.

27:35.840 --> 27:40.480
It's like minus one hour spent in that virtual world.

27:40.480 --> 27:44.040
It's like one hour that you're not spending in real life and it's like this idea of like

27:44.040 --> 27:45.880
wasted time.

27:45.880 --> 27:51.280
And I think it's pretty deep into the psyche of those people.

27:51.280 --> 27:56.360
And so one of the consequences of that is in the way they designed the headset and the

27:56.360 --> 28:00.480
way they designed the experiences and the marketing of it, basically what they try to

28:00.480 --> 28:07.400
convince you of is take your life and move your entire life to the metaverse.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.720
And then the reaction that people have to that is, well, this is going to take away

28:11.720 --> 28:17.320
stuff from my real life that I would rather not do in VR, right?

28:17.320 --> 28:22.000
The predict perception of VR is pretty dystopian because people think that, no, I want to make

28:22.000 --> 28:23.880
friends in real life, not only in VR.

28:23.880 --> 28:29.120
And so the mental framework of those people is always trying to put in opposition the

28:29.120 --> 28:31.400
real life in VR.

28:31.400 --> 28:38.680
Whereas what I find with my friends and myself, instead of the people either from my generation

28:38.680 --> 28:45.960
or with the same kind of interest is that they really think of virtual worlds in their

28:45.960 --> 28:53.680
daily life as sort of this balanced relationship where some of the most valuable time in their

28:53.680 --> 29:01.120
real life came as a result of the time they spent in virtual worlds.

29:01.120 --> 29:08.120
And so in that sense, I would say the core difference is meta is trying to think about

29:08.120 --> 29:11.800
how to keep you inside the VR headset as long as possible.

29:11.800 --> 29:17.680
I'm trying hard to think about how can I make you very happy when you take the VR headset

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
off?

29:18.680 --> 29:23.520
It's like, what do you get away from the experience?

29:23.520 --> 29:30.760
And so I realized it's a little bit abstract, so let me make that, let me get into more specific

29:30.760 --> 29:33.400
examples.

29:33.400 --> 29:40.360
Let me try to think of a great one.

29:40.360 --> 29:45.240
All right.

29:45.240 --> 29:49.160
I'm sure most of you are familiar with the art chat.

29:49.160 --> 29:55.360
And I'm sure as many of you are familiar with Facebook Horizon, which is the competitor

29:55.360 --> 29:57.080
to the art chat.

29:57.080 --> 30:02.920
And it seems as though regardless of how much money meta is pouring into Horizon, Horizon

30:02.920 --> 30:05.520
is not able to compete with VR chats.

30:05.520 --> 30:09.200
VR chat is just swinging whereas Horizon is not.

30:09.200 --> 30:11.400
And if you try to think, how is that possible?

30:11.400 --> 30:14.720
Why can't they just copy VR chat into the exact same thing?

30:14.720 --> 30:21.640
The reason why that is not possible is that as much as the people using VR chat every

30:21.640 --> 30:27.760
day and I've used VR chat a lot, love the time they spent inside VR chat, the most valuable

30:27.760 --> 30:31.840
thing they get out of VR chat actually happens outside of VR.

30:31.840 --> 30:36.000
It's the fact that those friends that you've made in VR chat, they just become friends

30:36.000 --> 30:39.760
as a whole in your daily life, the rest of your life.

30:39.760 --> 30:43.200
And you might even try to meet them in real life.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.560
It's the ability to be able to go inside VR chat.

30:46.560 --> 30:52.040
And after you've had maybe a long or stressful day, took to people and sort of have them

30:52.040 --> 30:55.760
and have like those sort of deep emotional meaningful conversation, and then you get

30:55.760 --> 30:57.640
out of VR and you feel better.

30:57.640 --> 31:02.240
It's like all those things that happen in VR and directly reflect back to your real

31:02.240 --> 31:03.400
life.

31:03.400 --> 31:09.080
And somehow every time something has that characteristic, it happens in VR but reflects

31:09.080 --> 31:12.760
in real life, meta is just not able to do it right.

31:12.760 --> 31:17.640
And instead what they offer you is, instead we're going to take, we're just going to

31:17.640 --> 31:20.400
increase the amount of time you can spend in VR.

31:20.400 --> 31:27.520
So if you look at the feature list of Horizon, they prioritize stuff like bring your laptop

31:27.520 --> 31:28.520
to Horizon.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.760
Because that's the way to sort of day thing that's going to like try to keep you longer

31:32.760 --> 31:40.760
in Horizon as opposed to how do we increase the ratio of meaningful conversation in Horizon

31:40.760 --> 31:43.600
as opposed to non meaningful conversation.

31:43.600 --> 31:48.560
And like the way you design that changes, like the way you think about it changes widely

31:48.560 --> 31:52.200
the design of like this from that form.

31:52.200 --> 31:58.320
So that would be like my very, very high strike high level answer that like I'm happy to dive

31:58.320 --> 32:02.480
into it, but I'm also realizing you might want something a little more specific.

32:02.480 --> 32:07.960
So I also share some specific details about my headset in terms of the philosophy of the

32:07.960 --> 32:08.960
headset itself.

32:08.960 --> 32:14.840
Yeah, I'm trying to be mindful of the time at the same time, but I also want to give

32:14.840 --> 32:16.560
you a little bit of a nuggets about the headset.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.000
So I'll choose one vertical and then I'm happy to talk about one.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.480
One vertical would be how do we think about comfort?

32:25.480 --> 32:30.280
And for that, I have to tell you a little bit more about again, how does company design

32:30.280 --> 32:31.880
their VR headset?

32:31.880 --> 32:36.720
The way VR headset is usually designed is you have a team that's going to come up with

32:36.720 --> 32:39.120
a list of features.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.840
Some of them are going to be hard requirements.

32:40.840 --> 32:45.600
Some of them are not stuff like facial tracking or body tracking or whatever.

32:45.600 --> 32:49.680
Once you have those features, you define what you need to achieve those features and then

32:49.680 --> 32:54.920
you build those gigantic prototypes like the one you saw in maybe Zercoverer's video.

32:54.920 --> 33:00.080
And once you have the gigantic prototypes, you try to make them smaller and then you send

33:00.080 --> 33:04.880
that to a factory, try to make it as small as possible without it breaking and then you

33:04.880 --> 33:06.560
have a headset and then you put that to market.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.760
That's how VR headsets is traditionally designed.

33:09.760 --> 33:14.760
One of the things we've decided to do at UNIGAT is to absolutely refuse to do that.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.400
And we start the other way.

33:16.400 --> 33:21.800
We try to make VR headsets just made out of plastic and we just try to make them as comfortable

33:21.800 --> 33:23.320
as possible.

33:23.320 --> 33:27.840
And then we put them on a ton of people, we put weights inside and we try to see when

33:27.840 --> 33:30.080
they stop being comfortable.

33:30.080 --> 33:34.320
And we find those threshold and we spend a lot of time trying to find what is comfortable

33:34.320 --> 33:39.840
or what is not and then we work it backwards and we say, okay, what features can we fit

33:39.840 --> 33:44.840
inside the headset without it being stopping to be comfortable.

33:44.840 --> 33:49.480
And what we find is that there's a lot of features out there that you might not have

33:49.480 --> 33:51.360
in the UNIVR headset.

33:51.360 --> 33:56.320
But that's because we started from this perspective of comfortable, maybe I had to remove a few

33:56.320 --> 34:01.680
features and our criteria when we looked at that feature is does that feature and that's

34:01.680 --> 34:06.320
how it ties back to the beginning of my story, does that feature benefits you once you take

34:06.320 --> 34:08.360
off the headset, yes or no.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.360
And does it make a significant difference?

34:12.360 --> 34:18.200
So for instance, a VR headset that you might have heard of, the PyMax, it's like this one

34:18.200 --> 34:23.960
kilogram gigantic thing that I'm not making this up is like this large.

34:23.960 --> 34:33.160
And the PyMax, I don't know if I can say this publicly, but the difference in resolution

34:33.160 --> 34:37.920
between our headset and the PyMax, which is the headset with the highest resolution of

34:37.920 --> 34:43.040
all time, it's like, again, this one kilogram gigantic big thing on your face.

34:43.040 --> 34:50.720
The percentage of like more resolution that they have is in the single digit branch.

34:50.720 --> 34:53.240
That's like, well, I'll share for now.

34:53.240 --> 34:58.400
But for that single digit, it's so hard to increase resolution that it results in this

34:58.400 --> 35:04.200
like gigantic system that is incredibly heavy with like two big cables plugged at the back

35:04.200 --> 35:05.360
of it.

35:05.360 --> 35:09.800
And that system is indeed like, I don't know, like four times higher resolution than a

35:09.800 --> 35:10.800
Quest.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.880
But the price of it is like being so huge.

35:12.880 --> 35:21.400
In our case, we're not quite to that resolution, but we've been so hot core about ergonomics

35:21.400 --> 35:27.360
that like it fits into something that is about a tenth of the weight of that thing.

35:27.360 --> 35:32.120
So this is probably one of the most ergonomic VR headset out there.

35:32.120 --> 35:40.920
And again, that's because we ask ourselves at the end of the day, if the resolution was

35:40.920 --> 35:45.560
like even twice as much when you take off the headset, what are the chances that you're

35:45.560 --> 35:50.400
like, oh, yeah, like this is really making my day much better that the resolution was

35:50.400 --> 35:52.800
like twice as much.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.560
It matters, but not as much as people think.

35:56.560 --> 36:00.240
And thus it shouldn't be, it shouldn't have that big of an influence on the design.

36:00.240 --> 36:06.520
So anyway, there's a long answer, but that's sort of how we approach things.

36:06.520 --> 36:10.240
Long answer and still did not reveal any trade secrets.

36:10.240 --> 36:16.600
We did not manage to, you know, yeah, I'll find out.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.600
All right, let's go to Ryan.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.400
I don't know if Ryan's on the very specific.

36:21.400 --> 36:25.760
Yes, it started art focus now it's doing many things, but for me, what it always attracted

36:25.760 --> 36:36.960
me to on cyber and I've spent an infinity amount of time working on on cyber is grand

36:36.960 --> 36:48.880
of those is your role objective of it being open and built on open standards.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.400
What does that mean?

36:50.400 --> 36:51.400
What does open mean?

36:51.400 --> 36:52.400
What does close mean?

36:52.400 --> 36:57.680
How does it different what are the opportunities challenges, et cetera?

36:57.680 --> 37:05.080
Yeah, I mean, like, so one thing is we on on cyber is a child of the work through space.

37:05.080 --> 37:10.000
So, so like we started because we wanted to like fulfill the need within the work space,

37:10.000 --> 37:14.840
not necessarily because we wanted to build general immersive experiences or whatnot.

37:14.840 --> 37:20.280
So the whole point has been that we have been building with very strong foundations for

37:20.280 --> 37:21.840
a progressive decentralization.

37:21.840 --> 37:28.040
I think there's a lot of companies in this space that like are built within with different

37:28.040 --> 37:30.320
principles and want to be open.

37:30.320 --> 37:34.840
But at some point, like when your foundations are aren't able to be open, like it's very

37:34.840 --> 37:39.680
hard for you to ever be part of a lot of space.

37:39.680 --> 37:44.560
What that means in our case is that from the ground up, we built on cyber on free opens

37:44.560 --> 37:45.560
or software.

37:45.560 --> 37:49.800
So there's no proprietary engine involved and we've never we're never going to have to

37:49.800 --> 37:56.880
answer to a big corporation that would own the proprietary engine or have a say in what's

37:56.880 --> 38:00.400
happening with their engine, which is not the case for everyone.

38:00.400 --> 38:04.640
And it's it's hard to do because like you have to rebuild a lot of things from the ground

38:04.640 --> 38:05.640
up.

38:05.640 --> 38:10.480
But I think it's the way that you can truly be free long term and have your users and

38:10.480 --> 38:12.120
community free.

38:12.120 --> 38:16.360
Number two is that we make sure that all assets are stored in the open.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.400
So there's like the whole principle of Web3 is your content and you can take it whatever

38:20.400 --> 38:21.840
you want.

38:21.840 --> 38:25.960
There is nothing within on Saber that isn't stored in the open.

38:25.960 --> 38:31.840
Of course, like there's different storage is not necessarily always the most efficient

38:31.840 --> 38:37.640
or faster performance type of solution for first storage, which is why we have always

38:37.640 --> 38:43.480
have like surfacing CDNs and different services that do things faster.

38:43.480 --> 38:49.640
But at the end of the day, all data is stored in the open and can be taken and taken from

38:49.640 --> 38:54.720
like, let's take the example of all spaces built with on Saber or this space metacampus

38:54.720 --> 38:55.720
that we're on right now.

38:55.720 --> 38:59.880
It is yes, stored on CDN, but also stored on IPFS.

38:59.880 --> 39:05.280
And if need be if ever tomorrow something happened and on Saber wasn't working anymore,

39:05.280 --> 39:10.360
you could totally take this space taken to another platform that uses the same standard

39:10.360 --> 39:18.160
we do, which is a pretty common standard in the web called GLTF, which is like what I

39:18.160 --> 39:24.040
would say is the equivalent of an HTML in the immersive web.

39:24.040 --> 39:29.840
And you would be able to run exactly the same space, exactly the same architecture and completely

39:29.840 --> 39:30.840
different platform.

39:30.840 --> 39:35.840
So for me, what open means is number one, you can restrict access to it and everyone can

39:35.840 --> 39:40.320
participate, which is why we don't have Google login or anything similar.

39:40.320 --> 39:45.240
But you can just log in with any type of wallet and soon enough can log in without a wallet

39:45.240 --> 39:46.240
even.

39:46.240 --> 39:52.800
Number two, I think that I spoke about it before, you cannot have a proprietary tech

39:52.800 --> 39:54.760
at the basis of the tech.

39:54.760 --> 40:00.280
And so we have chosen not to go with anything proprietary or a proprietary engine.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.640
And that there is very low, low cost to switching.

40:03.640 --> 40:08.640
So you don't want to make it so that people come in and are locked into it.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.200
Like most web two platforms do, like Instagram does or whatnot, like there's no way to go

40:13.200 --> 40:15.320
port your content easily.

40:15.320 --> 40:21.560
But with us, the idea is to have all those principles and follow them very, very closely.

40:21.560 --> 40:27.280
Of course, we don't know what, like, as I said, On Saber is a work in progress.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.720
It's a bottom up type of product.

40:28.720 --> 40:35.000
And we cannot know everything we need to do to do to everything we need to decentralize

40:35.000 --> 40:38.280
in order to be truly open from the ground up.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.440
But all our foundations are very open.

40:41.440 --> 40:46.240
And as we go without losing too much time on, oh, I think this should be decentralized

40:46.240 --> 40:51.800
or stored on chain or off chain or whatnot, we can go pretty fast while having a clear

40:51.800 --> 40:57.080
avenue for decentralization whenever we know exactly what that means and how that can be

40:57.080 --> 40:59.600
done efficiently.

40:59.600 --> 41:07.000
So yeah, that's pretty much like what I think we are doing right now to be able to be part

41:07.000 --> 41:09.800
of the open metaverse.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.800
Yeah.

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
Okay.

41:11.800 --> 41:18.960
Usually, I mean, this is the story of many things.

41:18.960 --> 41:26.640
Usually centralized solutions at a minimum start with some advantages, right?

41:26.640 --> 41:30.880
They usually tend to, you know, they're more convenient or they're more easily packaged

41:30.880 --> 41:37.400
up or they come with more prepackaged features or what have you.

41:37.400 --> 41:45.480
And sometimes it has worked out that open standards have taken a hold of HTML, not the

41:45.480 --> 41:47.440
information superhighway.

41:47.440 --> 41:53.520
Other times, you know, Linux for the desktop never really happened, but Linux eventually

41:53.520 --> 41:57.080
over decades when the server market.

41:57.080 --> 42:04.080
How do you view the strategic landscape here between a wide variety of closed or semi-closed

42:04.080 --> 42:08.960
platforms, you know, using quite mature game engines in most cases, right?

42:08.960 --> 42:16.520
You know, Unreal Engine or Unity who don't have to worry about any types of don't have

42:16.520 --> 42:21.160
to spend any cycles, development cycles or feature cycles and performance cycles trying

42:21.160 --> 42:23.160
to keep it decentralized and so on.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
Whatever it is going to deliver.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.520
We're going to deliver end user experience.

42:26.520 --> 42:30.000
How do you see this?

42:30.000 --> 42:31.440
It's a very interesting question.

42:31.440 --> 42:37.800
And I think we have to go back to our text text to try to start answering this question.

42:37.800 --> 42:41.440
Whenever we, when I started on Saber, there were, of course, like many choices we had

42:41.440 --> 42:42.440
to make.

42:42.440 --> 42:47.360
Like, what do we want to, what's the target for the build on Saber?

42:47.360 --> 42:49.000
What, how people are going to access it?

42:49.000 --> 42:50.720
Like, what's going to happen there?

42:50.720 --> 42:56.480
We chose the browser because to me, today is the most open type of distribution channel

42:56.480 --> 42:58.560
to go and reach people with apps.

42:58.560 --> 43:04.200
Like, web apps are very hard to be censored and can be distributed as you want if people

43:04.200 --> 43:05.200
have a link.

43:05.200 --> 43:07.200
So we decided to go with that.

43:07.200 --> 43:13.960
And with that, chose 3.js as a technology for like the basis of our tech.

43:13.960 --> 43:21.320
So the Linux in this case would be 3.js slash web.gls slash web.gpu, I guess.

43:21.320 --> 43:27.560
And then our focus is to make sure that we can build the best possible experience for

43:27.560 --> 43:32.440
our users and build the best possible UX for people to come in and enjoy being in those

43:32.440 --> 43:40.880
immersive worlds, which are themselves like run by web.gls, web.gpu soon and free open

43:40.880 --> 43:41.880
source software.

43:41.880 --> 43:42.880
Okay.

43:42.880 --> 43:51.520
Let's do another round on kind of state of today in adoption.

43:51.520 --> 43:55.920
I'm going to go back to Charlie.

43:55.920 --> 43:59.240
How many, where are digital wearables now?

43:59.240 --> 44:00.240
Right?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.240
Where are people using them?

44:01.240 --> 44:02.880
How many are the using them?

44:02.880 --> 44:08.560
What types of things are you seeing developing in the background that, you know, our average

44:08.560 --> 44:11.400
person today might not know about?

44:11.400 --> 44:16.840
And how do you expect this to change over the next one, two, three years?

44:16.840 --> 44:17.840
Sure.

44:17.840 --> 44:24.840
So I think like the key use cases for digital wearables right now are either in-game and

44:24.840 --> 44:29.400
like thinking more traditional gaming industry, whether it's like the daily active user base,

44:29.400 --> 44:32.920
generally a younger audience as collectibles.

44:32.920 --> 44:38.760
So I guess you're more like typical web three speculative NFT investment.

44:38.760 --> 44:48.120
Or as a way to unlock either physical redeemables, so like physical wearable utility, or more

44:48.120 --> 44:50.560
as like ticketing to events.

44:50.560 --> 44:56.480
So a lot of traditional fashion brands that have tried to enter the NFT space have based

44:56.480 --> 45:02.920
the utility around like access to fashion shows, like, yeah, special, like VIP access

45:02.920 --> 45:06.120
within their flagship stores and so on.

45:06.120 --> 45:13.520
So everything is quite heavily focused around existing fashion use cases, like you're, you

45:13.520 --> 45:20.280
know, you're literally wearing it in the physical world in a game, or it's giving you some kind

45:20.280 --> 45:23.240
of status.

45:23.240 --> 45:32.960
And I think right now, like the best web three use case for digital identity is the PFP.

45:32.960 --> 45:36.520
And you know, you wouldn't necessarily think of that as fashion, but it's doing very much

45:36.520 --> 45:37.520
the same thing.

45:37.520 --> 45:42.080
It's like signaling you as part of a community.

45:42.080 --> 45:44.840
It's saying something about your status.

45:44.840 --> 45:49.400
It's saying something about how early you are into the web three space.

45:49.400 --> 45:53.480
You know, it's communicating a lot in the same way that the passion does.

45:53.480 --> 46:00.760
So I see the evolution of wearables, like what does the PFP mean as we start to socialize

46:00.760 --> 46:08.920
more in 3D spaces as interoperable identity in open metaverse actually becomes something

46:08.920 --> 46:12.400
that there is like clear use case for.

46:12.400 --> 46:20.600
So, you know, it relies a lot, I think initially on a move from like text based social media

46:20.600 --> 46:28.560
like Twitter and Discord into social media happening within 3D spaces, which, you know,

46:28.560 --> 46:35.200
there are lots of amazing builders very proactively working on at the moment.

46:35.200 --> 46:43.520
The like the gaming use case isn't going to go away, but we are, you know, away off traditional

46:43.520 --> 46:47.840
game developers allowing external assets into their games.

46:47.840 --> 46:56.560
There's definitely an intent from like big game developers like Epic Ubisoft roadblocks

46:56.560 --> 47:01.440
to start, you know, exploring how they integrate with web three.

47:01.440 --> 47:04.160
Nobody really wants to be a first mover.

47:04.160 --> 47:09.480
There's a lot of pushback from the gaming community as well.

47:09.480 --> 47:15.600
So I guess one of the first things that needs to happen there is like just entirely abstracting

47:15.600 --> 47:21.640
away from talking about web three and NFTs and just, you know, creating new language

47:21.640 --> 47:22.640
around it.

47:22.640 --> 47:27.720
There's visceral reaction from their existing player bases.

47:27.720 --> 47:35.880
I think one of the first things that we'll see around interoperability within game developers

47:35.880 --> 47:41.240
is just within properties that that developer owns.

47:41.240 --> 47:46.400
So like for example, Epic opening up wearables and assets.

47:46.400 --> 47:52.160
So it could be used across like full guys, Rocket League Fortnite and so on.

47:52.160 --> 48:00.200
And I think we will start to see specific partnerships with these game developers where

48:00.200 --> 48:05.680
they are exploring a level of interoperability, but it's still going to be extremely pleased

48:05.680 --> 48:12.080
and sort of, you know, very narrow in terms of the partners that they work with.

48:12.080 --> 48:18.840
In terms of traditional fashion industry coming in, I think it's a less interesting proposition

48:18.840 --> 48:23.480
than new gen brands that are web three native starting up.

48:23.480 --> 48:28.840
I think there's a, as we kind of touched on with the first question you asked me, there's

48:28.840 --> 48:35.200
a whole lot of convincing for a, you know, a large subset of people of the value of digital

48:35.200 --> 48:36.840
wearables.

48:36.840 --> 48:42.320
I think the luxury fashion brands that came into the space over the last couple of years

48:42.320 --> 48:47.640
and by consulting for some of them were extremely surprised to find that none of their existing

48:47.640 --> 48:55.360
customer base were interested in adopting a web theory or buying NFTs and that actually

48:55.360 --> 49:03.600
their entire web three business needed to be contingent on their involvement in the web

49:03.600 --> 49:06.600
three community.

49:06.600 --> 49:15.280
So there's still like a huge division, I think, between like Jen Alpha, Gen Z who are used

49:15.280 --> 49:21.560
to the idea of digital wearable utility, a more traditional, I guess, as he said, like

49:21.560 --> 49:29.280
normal demographic where you need some kind of physical utility to make it make sense

49:29.280 --> 49:36.280
and web three audience where there's the understanding, like collecting something and having value

49:36.280 --> 49:38.800
over time.

49:38.800 --> 49:46.840
But I think, yeah, the main, the main first big step for adoption is social media in 3D

49:46.840 --> 49:50.000
spaces being the norm.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.720
So this is fascinating what you said because I think it matches what we see for the most

49:54.720 --> 49:55.720
part in art.

49:55.720 --> 50:02.400
So the major NFT art collectors are not on the whole, there's some famous exceptions,

50:02.400 --> 50:07.240
but like on the whole, they are not big traditional art collectors.

50:07.240 --> 50:14.240
They are people who grew up in the web three space and then found that NFT art varies types,

50:14.240 --> 50:17.480
represents their values and culture and what have you.

50:17.480 --> 50:20.680
You're saying the same thing is happening in fashion?

50:20.680 --> 50:22.320
Yes, exactly.

50:22.320 --> 50:30.440
You have very divided demographics and it's, you know, it's completely based on how do

50:30.440 --> 50:35.520
you value your identity and if your identity is born of internet culture, like most of

50:35.520 --> 50:40.040
us in this space, that's where you're going to pin more value is where you're going to

50:40.040 --> 50:45.440
be willing to spend more time, more money, like whatever investment looks like to you.

50:45.440 --> 50:52.840
Whereas if status or identity has always been rooted in your physical world or physical

50:52.840 --> 50:59.600
community, it's yet very difficult to imagine that switch.

50:59.600 --> 51:07.880
And so my parents and family are in the traditional art space, like art dealers and tea dealers.

51:07.880 --> 51:16.880
So I've seen like that side of what status looks like and the challenge in explaining

51:16.880 --> 51:21.600
the value of what a digital collectible looks like to somebody who's in Thai business is

51:21.600 --> 51:26.160
dealing in physical, and I can see like Ryan is smiling.

51:26.160 --> 51:27.160
Same situation.

51:27.160 --> 51:33.600
I mean, I say that my mum was signed up to this university course and it's like fully

51:33.600 --> 51:41.440
degenerated into web theory, but certainly it's like a big learning curve.

51:41.440 --> 51:52.240
Whereas I'd say especially my younger friends and also younger team members, absolutely

51:52.240 --> 51:59.240
normal to them that they would be spending more time worrying about what their digital

51:59.240 --> 52:05.120
identity, digital community and online friends are up to you.

52:05.120 --> 52:06.120
This is fascinating.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.120
I think it's right.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.320
I think we're going to have a generational shift.

52:09.320 --> 52:12.400
It'll be massive, but it'll take time because it's generational.

52:12.400 --> 52:16.600
Where do you think the, I mean, nobody knows for sure.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.600
And there's of course huge examples on the other side, right?

52:19.600 --> 52:22.960
There's some more digital native older people.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.960
There's some boomerish younger people.

52:24.960 --> 52:31.840
We know that's the case, but broadly, if you had to like pick a number, what age or what

52:31.840 --> 52:36.040
year of birth or where does the internet native generation start?

52:36.040 --> 52:37.040
Who are they?

52:37.040 --> 52:45.360
I would say it's Jen Alpha, internet native in terms of that, like it's just the standard

52:45.360 --> 52:53.280
for them that all of their socializing takes place in like avatar based virtual environments.

52:53.280 --> 52:56.880
They already understand the idea of trading in digital identity.

52:56.880 --> 53:01.600
Like it's the eight to 12 year olds right now who are already doing that in roadblocks

53:01.600 --> 53:03.840
and Minecraft.

53:03.840 --> 53:15.120
I think with Gen Z and this is just like speculative based on like my guess my own observations.

53:15.120 --> 53:30.880
I think there is a little bit more seriousness in that generation where the idea of, I guess,

53:30.880 --> 53:36.120
like, you know, exploring identity, like starting a business, trading within the digital world,

53:36.120 --> 53:44.240
like those feel, I guess, not as comfortable compared to like the younger like siblings

53:44.240 --> 53:48.920
and cousins in my family who are this like younger roadblocks generation.

53:48.920 --> 53:53.520
So you know, we pin like so much hope on Gen Z is like, okay, this is going to be the

53:53.520 --> 53:55.840
metaverse future.

53:55.840 --> 53:59.760
But I think there's actually a lot more resistance there.

53:59.760 --> 54:06.480
And if you spend any time on TikTok and have ever looked at posts around NFTs, the like

54:06.480 --> 54:13.600
the vitriol from that generation around NFTs and Web3 is probably the highest of any generation.

54:13.600 --> 54:16.480
So Gen Z is going to let us down again.

54:16.480 --> 54:19.040
I mean, sorry Gen Z.

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
Very interesting.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.040
All right.

54:22.040 --> 54:24.040
Let's switch to let's see.

54:24.040 --> 54:25.040
Let's see.

54:25.040 --> 54:32.560
You said something in your initial remarks and I laughed because I went back in 2013.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.120
I think it was 2013.

54:34.120 --> 54:35.920
It was Christmas of 2013.

54:35.920 --> 54:41.800
It was in New York and the first Samsung gear VR device came out.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.200
It wasn't 13, it was 12.

54:44.200 --> 54:45.200
So I bought it.

54:45.200 --> 54:53.160
I have this general who I'm for sure the oldest person in this panel.

54:53.160 --> 54:57.440
But I have a general and I will share it with everyone.

54:57.440 --> 55:01.800
It's a good way to try and not become outdated.

55:01.800 --> 55:06.920
Anytime a new technological thing happens, I just do it without thinking about if it makes

55:06.920 --> 55:08.920
sense or not.

55:08.920 --> 55:14.200
Because if you think about if it makes sense, as you pass, I don't know, the age of 25 or

55:14.200 --> 55:18.080
30 somewhere in there, you suddenly think like nothing actually makes sense.

55:18.080 --> 55:24.720
Oh no, that's not the things that, who wrote it, Douglas Adams wrote it.

55:24.720 --> 55:29.560
Things that happened before you were 25 are natural state of the world, right?

55:29.560 --> 55:33.800
Things that when you're 25 to 40 are an exciting career opportunity and things that are invented

55:33.800 --> 55:37.560
after 40 are terrible and against the natural order of things, right?

55:37.560 --> 55:42.760
This is how you will, this is how humans default work and you should assume you'll be a default

55:42.760 --> 55:43.760
human.

55:43.760 --> 55:48.560
And so you should assume your bias is going to be against new things once you get passed

55:48.560 --> 55:50.640
on in 25 or 27 or 30.

55:50.640 --> 55:55.360
So I have this general who now, once I started in a very American, whatever, whatever happens,

55:55.360 --> 55:57.720
anything new, I just do it.

55:57.720 --> 56:03.080
I take away from myself the decision of should I spend money on a VR set?

56:03.080 --> 56:04.080
There's a VR set I'm gonna buy it.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.080
And then I do my Virgo.

56:05.080 --> 56:06.080
I put it on.

56:06.080 --> 56:10.800
I hang it at like that helicopter and Iceland scene or something.

56:10.800 --> 56:16.440
I was like, holy, I'm not gonna say this was a university course, but this is the most

56:16.440 --> 56:18.200
incredible thing I've ever seen.

56:18.200 --> 56:24.480
This is like, so I called my mom and my dad and everyone I know and I was like, you gotta

56:24.480 --> 56:26.680
come over and everyone's like, you gotta be kidding me.

56:26.680 --> 56:27.680
This is amazing, huh?

56:27.680 --> 56:33.640
And a month later, I was sitting on the shelf gathering desk.

56:33.640 --> 56:39.200
And I have the Oculus channel and it's more or less sitting on the shelf and I've gone

56:39.200 --> 56:41.840
in to see all of it right like that.

56:41.840 --> 56:48.960
But here I am actively building a platform that displays on the web and displays in VR.

56:48.960 --> 56:57.040
And I would say 99% of the time I spend in that platform is on the web.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.640
It's not in VR.

56:59.640 --> 57:06.520
It's quite frankly, at least for me, I find it to be kind of a pain.

57:06.520 --> 57:12.120
Yes, I want to check out something at home going through the browser is easy.

57:12.120 --> 57:15.680
Going and finding their headset, putting it on, messing up my hair.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.480
Oh, I forgot to charge it.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.960
Oh, I had to plug it in all this stuff.

57:19.960 --> 57:21.800
God forbid because someone comes sees you.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.560
You look like a complete weirdo, right?

57:23.560 --> 57:26.040
Like if someone comes in and likes it.

57:26.040 --> 57:28.640
So what's going on there?

57:28.640 --> 57:31.120
Like when are we actually going to adopt VR?

57:31.120 --> 57:32.760
What needs to happen for us to adopt VR?

57:32.760 --> 57:34.440
Does it matter if we adopt VR?

57:34.440 --> 57:39.160
I assume it does given you're spending your life building VR headsets.

57:39.160 --> 57:41.520
Tell us about this topic.

57:41.520 --> 57:42.520
Sure.

57:42.520 --> 57:43.760
That's a fantastic question.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.320
I love it.

57:45.320 --> 57:48.480
Let me give you the super short answer first.

57:48.480 --> 57:56.960
The super short answer is interesting because it builds on what I used set before 6.5.2.9

57:56.960 --> 58:07.160
in Charlie, which is if you look at the very, very young kids like I look at my cousins,

58:07.160 --> 58:09.560
they are already using VR almost every day.

58:09.560 --> 58:15.920
So you already have, in fact, millions of kids, the very, very young ones that are using VR,

58:15.920 --> 58:21.280
that there is almost the only one using it very actively.

58:21.280 --> 58:26.280
But still that does not answer your question of why do, like, why is it depending on the

58:26.280 --> 58:27.280
process?

58:27.280 --> 58:28.680
And I think you're right.

58:28.680 --> 58:31.400
It absolutely is.

58:31.400 --> 58:35.160
Some of you might have seen that Fred going on on Twitter.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.160
It's a fascinating one.

58:36.160 --> 58:41.960
It's like someone that basically explains that it took them about 35 minutes to get into

58:41.960 --> 58:46.040
a multiplayer session with their brother in VR.

58:46.040 --> 58:48.880
And so you describe the process pretty well.

58:48.880 --> 58:54.160
Usually the way it goes is you grab the headset, you try turning it on.

58:54.160 --> 58:55.160
Nothing happens.

58:55.160 --> 58:57.360
You turn it down, press the button again.

58:57.360 --> 59:01.400
Okay, because when it's turned off, you have to press for a little longer, actually.

59:01.400 --> 59:04.440
Then it turns on and actually, no, there's no battery left.

59:04.440 --> 59:07.520
So you have to charge it because the battery drains with sub plug.

59:07.520 --> 59:11.680
So you charge it for about, as you end up, it's like two hours and a half.

59:11.680 --> 59:15.480
You charge it for a while, then you take it, then you turn it on.

59:15.480 --> 59:19.800
Then you have to, for some reason, sometimes you have to pair it again with your phone.

59:19.800 --> 59:20.800
Not even really know why.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.400
Turn on Bluetooth, 30 seconds.

59:23.400 --> 59:27.280
That's like a, actually I shouldn't say that to you.

59:27.280 --> 59:30.080
Actually, no hope when it happens.

59:30.080 --> 59:31.080
The number is crazy.

59:31.080 --> 59:34.320
It was a bug they tracked back at the middle.

59:34.320 --> 59:36.320
And it's a crazy one.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.360
Anyway, you pair it again.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.160
Okay, it's spared.

59:40.160 --> 59:44.440
Now you have to update your Facebook account or Oculus account.

59:44.440 --> 59:48.080
Actually, if you have an Oculus account, because like you were from the early days, you have

59:48.080 --> 59:50.720
to turn your close accounts to a Facebook account.

59:50.720 --> 59:53.440
Then you get an AR message that does not work on mobile.

59:53.440 --> 59:57.040
You have to go on your laptop, try to log in again, and then it tells you you have to

59:57.040 --> 59:59.160
turn your Facebook account into a metal account.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.120
I'm really, like I swear, I'm not making this up.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.960
So you've converted to a metal account, you log in again from the headset, which by the

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.080
way, it's going to be the worst experience in your life if you use a password manager.

01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:14.880
Because most likely you're going to be taking the headset and be like, everything on your

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:18.560
laptop like that, and with the controller trying to type the text.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:21.480
Okay, you've gone through all of that, congrats.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.720
Now you have to update the software on the headset.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:27.440
So it's going to turn off and update and everything.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:32.800
And then once you do that, you realize actually on the Quest, or some reason, the apps of the

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:37.400
OS and the OS itself are not like updated together.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.800
So now you think, oh, I'm good.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.800
I'm just going to log in with my friends.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:45.440
And you click like the friend app, which is like the most basic operating system app you

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440
could imagine.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.240
Oh, no, that one needs to be updated separately.

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.240
You're going to update that one.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.960
And then you're going to try to join with your friends and you're going to struggle so

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.240
hard to join with your friends.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.320
Like I don't want to even describe that process to you because like then I'm just going to

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.160
like hijack the whole course.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.440
Just talk about that.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:09.680
And finally, when you're supposed to be in with your friend, you're all right.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680
That's it.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.080
Like you can hear each other.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.360
For some reason, just like a regular call, but at least you can hear each other.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.880
So now maybe you're going to start, let's say one of my favorite game, show up to the

01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:21.880
developers, Dimeo.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.640
You start Dimeo, you can hear each other in the Oculus thing.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:30.960
And then you realize actually, if you're in like a room together with the Oculus thing,

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.880
it's a different thing than the multiplayer inside the game, even though both of them use

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.000
the Oculus API.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:44.040
So now you have to get out of the game, get out of the room that you are in the Oculus

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:47.720
sort of social thing, create a new one inside the game.

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.000
And then you're like, you have to send the secret code of that room to your friends.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.480
So then you take off the headset and you try to WhatsApp them the good thing.

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.480
I'm getting some questions.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:57.480
Yeah.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.400
And this is why I use the browser.

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.760
So when is this going to go away?

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:09.320
When can we actually like get into VR without a PhD in computer science?

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:10.320
Exactly.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:13.800
So when is that going to go away?

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.680
Well, that's what I'm trying to do.

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:20.960
And I think that some, here's my guess.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.680
I would say I don't really trust meta to solve it.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.320
I don't really trust HTC either or Valve.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:33.640
I think their track record shows that they're not going to solve for it.

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:37.520
I would say Apple is one that might be able to solve it.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.400
And then my company were trying to solve it.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.000
And the answer is the most boring one.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.600
It's going to be a very boring answer.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:49.400
But the solution is just we have a bunch of developers and we're just trying it all day

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:53.000
long and we're just solving those pain points one by one.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:58.920
And it's long and boring, but polishing the edges off and making it smooth is just long

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.920
and boring work.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.920
And that's just what we do.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.480
And there's not really any other around that.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:09.800
So yeah, that's, and once this is solved, then yes, certainly once you can just grab

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:13.720
the headset, put it on the experience of anything in VR as opposed to like this 35

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.560
minutes long process.

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:20.680
Then yeah, I think it's going to brutally change the adoption curve.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:25.760
And we can already see that because the very young ones are spending a lot of time in it.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760
So that would be my takeaway.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:34.200
Okay, I want to ask a related question.

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.200
I have no insight information just where I read from.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:42.880
I'm going to have a scoble which bring later into the course.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:46.560
Apple, and I think it's now been delayed with what they were going to do.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:56.160
But their big idea was or rumors were they were developing the super cool AR glasses.

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:57.160
And it's Apple.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:01.160
So they're going to be awesome, but turns out they're not going to watch them this year.

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:07.160
But they were explicitly saying, you know, the way we get to make sure that we're going

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:11.600
to do the mass adoption is AR, not VR.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.600
Because I guess you can still see your day, and I'll be more like a pair of glasses, not

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.600
a big book headset.

01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.320
What do you think about that?

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.800
Yeah.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:32.720
My sort of takeaway on that is, okay, so there's a few things.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:41.600
The first one is I think people love to say that because AR is easier to understand.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.520
They're looking for a compelling narrative.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:52.840
And AR is not most of when people think of AR as kind of like a phone that's trapped

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:53.840
to your face.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:56.080
So you can just see your phone open.

01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:02.640
So you don't really have to sit down and think it through of like, what is it?

01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:08.680
Is a radically new paradigm shift in the way we use computer to understand AR.

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.480
It's like pretty easy to understand.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:16.000
So to me, I think the whole debate is actually kind of missing the point.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.600
And I know people love to ask me that question, but to me, it feels a little bit like as if

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:29.160
in the early 80s, people would ask me, do you think?

01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:35.960
Do you think, I don't know, like facts or cassettes are going to win?

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:41.960
Like do you think we're going to send each other data by printing it out from the computer

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:47.040
or do you think we'll keep it in a digital form and put it on a cassette and send it

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.040
to each other?

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:51.080
Like what do you think is going to be the best way to send data around?

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.960
And turn it out, none of those view would have been correct.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:59.960
It's just that those views are easier to translate into what we already know in the real world.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.000
But the one that turned out to be true, it turned out to be none of those.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.120
And so I think here it's kind of like the same thing where when you go and actually

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:16.400
ask the people that use it every day, AR or VR, you realize that the line is very blurred.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.600
And that's also my personal belief, which is very soon people are just going to kind

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:25.320
of forget that AR and VR are two different things anyway.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.920
Because some of the things we need to improve the VR experience look a lot like AR.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:34.680
Like for instance, here's one thing that you've certainly experienced.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.880
When you put on the VR headset, like there's my laptop right now for me, the fact that

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:44.080
I can just like move and sort of bash into the laptop and break it, that's a big issue.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.920
So the way to solve that is to actually be able to, when I get close to the laptop, I

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:53.400
can see that though, and I can see it exactly like in real life.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:54.960
And there are many ways to that.

01:06:54.960 --> 01:07:00.480
You have some displays that are transparent and they can turn on and off the transparency.

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:04.160
You have pass through where you have cameras that we project what happens in the real world

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.560
in the VR headset.

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:15.040
But my sort of, the TLDR is, I think it's a false dichotomy that people like to make

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:20.720
because they feel slightly disappointed by the adoption curve of VR.

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:23.520
And they say, no, no, no, but the field is interesting.

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:26.680
VR has not taken off as fast as we thought it would.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.400
But actually the thing afterwards is going to take off really fast and that thing is AR.

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.520
My take is that lack nuance and the real IT is more nuanced and the real IT is actually

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:40.960
those things are going to become kind of the same thing.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:46.440
And we want to really even think of them as separate stuff as time goes on and as adoption

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:48.040
continues to grow.

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.040
Okay.

01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:50.040
Thank you.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:08:03.120
All right, let's talk about present day adoption now in on cyber in for my view living in this

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:12.360
is the one that so far has the most of option.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:16.600
Okay, people use it to show their NFTs, right?

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:24.680
So you can't imagine a more like native set of people than people who have NFTs or can

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:30.680
create NFTs and I said, oh, I would like to show my NFT and a matter of words, made out

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:31.680
of NFTs.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:40.960
I would even say even within that, the what I've seen is the fastest to jump on it are

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:46.400
artists, creators like the most sophisticated NFT people are even the collectors, right?

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400
They're the creators.

01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:53.200
And so because I've had many discussions and people have to do this and I'm working

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200
to do this.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:09:01.480
I mean, the ones who say yes instantly require no convincing or NFT artists, which you know,

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.160
these are like the apex NFT naders.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:09.360
So that part's going well, that seems clear.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:19.000
Where do you see more adoption by less apex digital NFT naders?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.040
What do you think comes next?

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:26.680
Yeah, I think that like one one thing that's very interesting about on saber and how it's

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:32.040
got an adoption across like this space specifically is that it's a tool that allows people to

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040
build their own world.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:38.080
And kind of like the analogy I have is like almost like when you were a kid and like you

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.600
were imagining these things and imagining yourself building castles at home out of like

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:45.800
pillows or whatnot, like this is kind of the same feeling that you have whenever you curate

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:50.320
the on-saber space, like the idea without saber is to make it as easy as possible for

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.320
anyone.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:57.440
You really anyone from a newcomer into the space to a gamer maybe but definitely not

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:00.520
the 74 gamers to go and build worlds.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.760
And I think that world building has been popularized by a bunch of labs like the like the sims,

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:10.600
for example, or of course, like within the more gamers type of spheres, roadblocks and

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.520
Minecraft and whatnot.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.280
But it hasn't gone to my mother.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.280
My mother hasn't done world building.

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:24.440
I think that on-saber and like what we're trying to achieve is a tool that allows anyone

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.840
to be able to build worlds and allows for 3D to be kind of democratized across the hands

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.760
of everyone, not just 3D modelers or gamers that have been able to like play around with

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.200
world building at 3D but really anyone at all.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:46.920
So I think that sure like I think that the space, the web 3 space is a lot of early adopters.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:54.280
I think that the fact that artists and collectors but artists even more impressively like a lot

01:10:54.280 --> 01:11:02.080
of the artists we have in this space today are not like big like are not crypto G's or

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:05.440
I come from from like the Bitcoin days or whatnot.

01:11:05.440 --> 01:11:10.880
They're not necessarily the biggest technology native people like or but they're able to

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:16.880
go and build with on-saber and curate their experiences.

01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:22.080
So I think it's very encouraging that they are able to go and create more than it's a

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:30.080
worry that like we don't have enough people curating worlds or whatnot.

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.960
I think what's very interesting about the web 3 spaces that you have people from all

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:41.200
boards like you have people that are tech native, that are crypto native, that are not at all,

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:45.880
that have always been doing painting, have always been doing something else.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:52.400
It's not like it's easy to pinpoint what kind of tech scales or capabilities like someone

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.320
web 3 has.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:59.520
So I think that having adoption early and like that kind of a space just is very telling

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:06.120
of where this could go and I am very confident that the moment we are able to go and just

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:11.760
make it easier for people outside of web 3 to come in and use those tools and have 3D

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.520
democratized the way we have for artists and collectors in the web 3 space until now.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.680
That's the moment where we are going to see like more adoption across people.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:23.680
I think everyone wants to be a world builder.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:28.960
And I don't know anyone that would answer a no to the question would you like to get back

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.400
to the imagination you had whenever you were a kid and building these castles at home with

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.400
pills.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:40.200
So I think that if we're able to give back this effect and this feeling to people all

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.320
across the web 3 space, the moment we have easier tools to onboard other people outside

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:49.440
of web 3, the moment is that we're going to have more adoption clearly.

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.360
So I mean, I think it's up to us to number one, communicate better as to like what can

01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:02.320
be done with this tool and like these immersive tools on the web.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:07.840
Like that you can come in build your own world slash universe, share it with anyone with a

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.960
link and anyone across the world can come and enjoy it in the same way.

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:17.520
Now it's up to us to first communicate that and number two just build the right tooling

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.960
for people to be able to come in obviously like we don't expect to be hidden behind a

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:27.720
MetaMask connect forever like MetaMask is as much as they've been doing good stuff for

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:32.240
this space like our is a very hard tool to use for most people.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:36.160
Web 3 browsers in general are pretty hard to use for most people and call it a wallet

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:41.200
even is pretty confusing to like the people, my friends and the people who aren't in web

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.200
3.

01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.080
So I think it's up to us to just build the right tooling.

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:53.080
Okay, I'm going to switch now to the not the far future.

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:57.520
I'm pretty sure the far future minimums know given the pace of technological development

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.520
happening.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.680
I assume the AIs will have taken over by them.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.240
Let's go for the medium future.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.240
It's 2023.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.720
Let's say 2030.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:15.880
We'll again start with Charlie in broadly the field we're talking about.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.440
What does the world look like then?

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.240
How different is it from today?

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.480
How what should we expect?

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:28.720
I'm well aware all of us are just guessing.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:37.080
But at least you're in the field working on real problems so your guesses are forged

01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:41.680
from some actual experiences as opposed to other people who are just guessing.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.400
So give us your view of 2030.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:51.200
So I think I was like going back to what Ryan was just saying about the tooling.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:58.440
Right now we are at the skeleton of infrastructure for Web 3 which you do need to be reasonably

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:02.320
text savvy to make your way through.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.880
There's a lot of fleshing out to do.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:12.160
I think by the time we're hitting 2030 that's going to be done to a pretty significant degree.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:20.260
I mean the way that I think about metaverse is that it's like various digital layers on

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.360
top of the physical world.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:30.520
And the first kind of key point that we need to move to is where it feels like there isn't

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:35.760
really a division between physical identity and digital identity, your physical life experience,

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.080
digital life experience.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:46.040
So I would see 2030 as being like we've reached a point where the technology is good enough,

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:53.400
accessible enough where we're not thinking about the switch from physical into digital,

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:55.720
especially when it comes to socializing.

01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:02.480
And I think again like going back to the eight to 12 year olds, this is already their reality.

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:08.480
They come home from school and then they're in like audio based, audio based like social

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.400
platform by Fortnite for example.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.920
And they're just like carrying on with their brands from their day at school.

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:20.760
There's no consideration that like I'm switching from physical identity to digital identity.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:27.040
So I think it's getting to the point where that is really widespread.

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:33.440
I think there'll be a lot of development still to do going back to what Maxime is working

01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:39.760
on about when you're in the virtual space, you want to leave it where that has actually

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:42.120
improved your quality of life.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:46.160
I think that's going to be a lot of work to continue to do that.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:52.800
But I think the like the clear division will have gone or dissolved by that time.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.800
Yeah.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:55.960
Okay.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:08.360
So I agree it's always a hard to do this kind of prediction because you're kind of sitting

01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:14.000
yourself up in a way to look like an idiot because as always you know you miss some stuff

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.080
and then people look back.

01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080
But what I can do.

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.640
It's seven years from now.

01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:18.640
We're safe.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:19.640
Yeah.

01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:20.640
Right.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:26.080
So but still like you know we have a company you and I and we're trying to we're investing

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.080
our time and money.

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:32.760
And so when I can answer is well where are we investing and how does like how are like

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.400
what are some believe that for that where we have put some skin the game basically.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.920
And where do we put some skin in the game is.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:53.320
You know I was on a flight to the US recently and Stuart is started stuck with me and I

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:58.080
told her I work in VR and told me how my little nephew is super young he's using that

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.320
all day.

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.360
And like that's like that's like a new kind of question that now I have very often with

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.280
people where VR is the thing that someone very young in their family is using a lot.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:12.280
And it's almost like an alternative to using a console.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:18.640
And so in seven years from now those 12 to like 15 years old they're going to be old

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:25.320
enough to make their own purchase and and and and buy their own content.

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:29.760
And there's a few things that are going to change that are pretty fundamental.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.800
And so I think it's useful to share that because I think many people are ignoring that in the

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.800
industry.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:39.760
As you know VR makes people sick you get motion sickness or people have a hard time

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:48.360
understanding having like special awareness or that there is a social acceptance issue

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:51.040
where you look weird if you are your headset.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.960
So what is interesting is all those young people that are going up with VR right now

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.480
they won't suffer from those.

01:18:57.480 --> 01:19:05.960
And so in 2030 what I see is a generation of now very young adults that are looking for

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:10.000
better hardware, better software, better experiences.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:18.520
And the other thing that I see is your the opportunity window in like traditional internet

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.640
is closing very fast.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.720
Like if you're building a nap and putting it on the app store you're competing against

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.240
so many people so much money so many momentum so much stuff.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:35.200
It's like you want to make it here's a company I recently invested in that does dating in

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.200
VR.

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:42.360
Well if you want to do dating in like the real world there is like 20 different apps and

01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:47.160
they're all owned by like a few gigantic billion dollar groups and it's like really hard to

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.440
compete in the VR world.

01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:54.720
There's like a bunch of kids and and they're building a bunch of apps and like that's where

01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:01.520
the new space for opportunity is and so seven years more people opportunity are sort of

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:08.000
clocked up in the traditional digital world and so VR becomes one where you can send those

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000
opportunities.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:15.040
Now our diet is back into crypto as a way to sort of finish this answer.

01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:20.400
This is where crypto and VR are hyper hyper like super relevant to each other where basically

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:33.840
it's going to be super hard to convince Microsoft or EA or or any of those very large game

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:39.800
publishers to switch to crypto for their games right because what like they have nothing

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:43.240
like frankly they have nothing to they're already making pretty much as much money as

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.080
they possibly can right.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:52.640
And and the premise of crypto is more so a threat to their business model than something

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:55.560
that is going to help them.

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:01.840
It's like Apple like Apple is never going to allow you to build a great great wallet

01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:07.480
on iOS like I'm strongly strongly doubt that because crypto to some extent is threatening

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:12.120
some of what enables Apple to have built this manipulate over time.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:17.080
Now if you look at VR people like me where I have the opposite problem we like we've

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.760
not built anything we're starting from complete scratch and we're looking for people that

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:23.720
are super eager super excited.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:29.240
And if anything if we can find a way to align a large number of people to collaborate on

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:36.040
stuff in a decentralized manner such that we can come up and try to sort of all group

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:40.320
together against those gigantic monopolies of course we're going to welcome it with open

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:42.040
arms right.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:46.320
And so the other thing that I see for VR is that all of those things that you see on

01:21:46.320 --> 01:21:54.400
the fringes of sort of society right where Apple might not have many much stuff to gain

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.360
integrating crypto into the iPhone but I have a lot of things to gain integrating crypto

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:05.000
for it because now all of a sudden I'm attracting users that prior to that I had not any access

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:12.400
to I'm attracting content creators that perked that they had zero access to and and my closing

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.080
thought on this will be the following.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:22.960
I believe that software paradigm are often enabled by new hardware and those things they

01:22:22.960 --> 01:22:24.960
come sort of hand in hand.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:31.280
One famous example would be the iMac which we tend to forget is called the iMac because

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.000
it stands for internet Macintosh and you have to remember that back then it was the first

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.960
computer that shipped with high speeds of modern ports web browser inside the OS it

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:51.320
shipped with web browser inside a ship with an OS level SDK for connecting for writing

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:58.160
apps that connects to the internet and so it helped their hardware right because it gave

01:22:58.160 --> 01:23:03.920
them access to a new growing market and it helped this new set of protocols because now

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.160
they had a dedicated device that embraced them.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.960
In my case it's pretty similar I have a lot to gain by embracing those new standards and

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:17.160
trying to accrue value with them over time and I think those standards are going to have

01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:23.640
a very hard time convincing team cook to make a great crypto experience on the iPhone

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:28.400
and disrupt himself and his own app store but they're going to have a very easy time convincing

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:34.920
me to make my VR headset deeply deeply integrated down to the OS level with crypto to those

01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.920
with the micro addictions.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.920
That's very interesting.

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:42.720
Can I view for how you play 30?

01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:49.920
Yeah I think one thing that I would have never guessed is like how much beauty and culture

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:57.480
and belonging would be democratizing I think that my prediction for 2030 is like we build

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:03.720
this new space on the web where people can belong and live culture and find beauty every

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:04.720
single day.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.880
I think it's important for us to just keep on focusing on making sure that it's open

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:15.720
and that people can freely come in and leave and not be chained by any type of centralized

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.720
power.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.000
My prediction is that we actually get there through the power of culture because now

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.200
that all the creators are on our side I think it's going to be hard for the centralized

01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:34.320
systems to go and build as cool experiences or as beautiful experiences online as they

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:43.640
can be by this army of decentralized collaboration this army of really really cool creators from

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:45.520
all across the world.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.440
So my guess is it keeps on going and the decentralized web very soon is just the coolest

01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:58.560
place ever to discover content and to live like truly live experiences rather than just

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.360
be consumed by them.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:03.440
So I do predict that we'll get there.

01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:04.800
There's a lot of people working on it.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.360
There's a lot of good intentions.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:08.360
So I believe.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:18.920
Okay, I'm going to ask the audience to start sending questions to the UNIC team which will

01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:26.600
feed them to me and I'll ask them of you and when you give your questions let us know if

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:30.520
they are general or for a specific person.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:34.520
And if you'd like us to address them to someone specifically or just for the panel

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.520
and what we want to answer.

01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:38.840
But I'll wait for those to come in.

01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:41.320
Like I'll stay with Ryan since we're talking.

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:51.280
Like are we going to see ready player one type things in the next 15, 20 years where

01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.720
we're I mean genuinely living your way.

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:56.320
I want to speak to a normal person.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:59.320
And I say oh none of us right.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:13.040
They imagine already player one a fully realistic fully immersive full VR economy.

01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:15.040
And then they look at what's happening.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.880
Obviously it doesn't exist right now.

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:21.680
And then there's maybe some disappointed is actually what's happening.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.680
What's happening now?

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:23.680
Is that going to happen?

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.800
Is that even realistic to think about?

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:26.800
Absolutely.

01:26:26.800 --> 01:26:33.640
I think that the hardest thing to get past is probably like culture and having people

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:41.400
want to do or live experiences online rather than just like visit them or like be pretty

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:45.280
much absent while experiencing them.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.160
I think that tech is going to get better at an exponential rate.

01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:54.600
And technically for sure I think there's going to be a way to do all these photo realistic

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:59.320
experiences that I've seen examples of things that are pretty mind blowing today already.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:06.080
So I don't think it's going to be it's that far off or like that hard to do.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:07.480
Now how is it going to happen?

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:09.080
I have no clue.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:14.200
I think that my position on this has always been to just wait and see what people want

01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:16.320
to do with these things.

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:21.960
My perspective is that I'm going to keep on having very strong deep, deep like connection

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:27.600
with the community and what people actually want to do and how they want to experience

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:31.320
these immersive spaces online.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.240
And they should just keep on building from there.

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:38.320
So I think that yeah, we could really play one.

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.000
Something similar to really play one is something that's pretty much doable in a few years.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.480
But I don't know if it's what people really want to do.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:51.640
But I know it's how to ask for the next thing and the next thing.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:52.640
So we'll see.

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:58.040
I'm going to ask you why we wait for the questions coming because I think this is partially a

01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:04.080
hard word topic because basically, and I'll say this for the audience, the most common

01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:12.280
thing that I have in my Discord DMs is Ryan yelling at me about how we're making our spaces

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:18.800
to make performance better for normal people.

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:25.840
And this is, I log in on with a fancy graphic card and a big desktop.

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:30.480
And obviously, Ryan's correct because a lot of people are logging in on phones or on the

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:31.480
computers.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.160
And that's what today's experience is that are nowhere close to being photo-rosed.

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:42.440
They are not in the bad way, but sort of cartoonish, right?

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.440
They're never on photo-rulism.

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.400
They're never on what people see when they watch the movie.

01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:53.000
And we still struggle with performance.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:01.360
Is this something that GPUs will take care of it in a decade or are we waiting 30 years

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.360
for this?

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.000
Or what does the curve look like?

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
Sure.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:13.040
Okay, that's an excellent question.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.680
All right, so the short answer is actually yes.

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:22.440
If you just have to be like a little patient and actually we're going to go there and surprisingly

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.680
fast.

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:30.560
For the people that are interested in stuff like neural radiance fields, which are a type

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:36.600
of neural networks for 3D rendering, those are showing incredible results and really fast

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.560
and improving really quickly.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:43.600
And there are a lot of people in the field that like me believe that those might be a

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.800
very short path toward photo-realism.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:55.680
Another thing to note is in general AI slash neural networks enable rendering as vastly,

01:29:55.680 --> 01:30:02.560
and improve the performance of rendering and GPUs are just kind of by themselves getting

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.680
better and better.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:11.000
So the short answer is you are certainly getting there, that is for sure.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.720
How long is it going to take?

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:19.920
I would say that within a decade it's going to be pretty wild, how different those things

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.080
are going to look.

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:27.960
Now sort of my, and I'll just, I'll give the short version of it, but my slightly longer

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:32.080
answer is I would actually question the premise of the question.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:36.400
And I will actually say, well, do photo-realism really matter?

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:38.120
And I would question that a lot.

01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:44.480
And I will say the following.

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:49.960
Picsar is an incredible example of how you can convey emotion, meaning and beauty without

01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:55.560
photo-realism, if you just focus your effort on the right stuff.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:59.600
And there's a story, if people are familiar with me, I have to let's say a million times,

01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.360
so they may be super bored about it.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:07.320
But one simple story is when, it's a little more of a bit at the beginning, but when people

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:10.920
die, the first thing that happens is that their eyes dry off.

01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:15.040
So when they're, because they are dried off, you don't have like any light reflection in

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.480
your eyes.

01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:22.600
And as a result of that, the human brain evolved such that when you talk to someone, the first

01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:28.040
thing that your brain does is look for those light reflection in their eyes.

01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:32.240
Because if they are missing, it means the person is very, very sick or dying or maybe

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:33.240
already dead.

01:31:33.240 --> 01:31:37.600
And so that's a kind of built deep inside of like the back of your brain.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:42.640
And thus, if I show you a 3D rendering of a world and you're talking with people, and

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:48.520
I just remove the light reflections in their eyes, it's going to feel really uncanny and

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.120
you're really not going to have a good time.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:52.240
If you're going to feel really weird.

01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:59.480
And those things, I think, are going to have quite a big impact knowing what details are

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:03.760
needed for people to have this sort of comfortable feeling.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:10.320
But the overall look and photo-realism, I would strongly sort of push back and say that it's

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:13.480
necessary and I think you are just a good example.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:22.720
So my overall takeaway is people in the industry, like people making anime or Pixar or to some

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:28.000
extent VR chat, although I think we're still very far from a guru of Kuwaiti Nude, I think

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:34.720
are kind of proof that photo-realism isn't really needed as much as people think it is

01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:38.040
as long as you nail the right details.

01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:44.440
And you might think that, yeah, but all the rooms, they look bad in VR.

01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:49.400
Like a virtual cafes, most of them VR, I can't feel good in them, I'm sure with photo-realism

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:51.000
it would feel better.

01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:56.160
And again, I would, as I said, push back against that once more and say the following, must

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:58.760
cafes that I've been to feel good.

01:32:58.760 --> 01:33:05.960
One of the reasons that I feel good in it is because it's built upon literally like hundreds

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:13.200
of years of interior designers iterating on how to make a place feel comfortable.

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.720
And it turns out what makes you comfortable in VR in the real world are two different

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:17.720
things.

01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:24.280
And you don't have that kind of like care and experience and for VR where people have just

01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:31.160
spent like 20,000 hours trying to find how to make people comfortable in virtual spaces.

01:33:31.160 --> 01:33:36.440
And I think part of the revolution is not necessarily having it be photo-realistic, but

01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:40.600
just sort of as an industry learning how to make those spaces more comfortable.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:45.680
Yeah, no, I mean look for the foreseeable future.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.960
And I'm 24 by 24 pixel pump, right?

01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:56.880
So it works fine for emotion and identity and branding.

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.960
But it's also, I want to call this to an objective truth.

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:06.920
It's not like we tested the photo-realistic and decided to do the work, we just can't

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920
do it.

01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:11.920
So it's extremely convenient if we concluded the photo-realistic's not any good.

01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:15.840
This is like me concluding that thinking of basketball is a good thing.

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.880
I think I was going to dunk a basketball anyway, so it's better that I concluded that

01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:21.560
it's not a good thing, right?

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:31.960
So I do think people wonder about this, right?

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:38.520
And you can say, I don't want to pick someone, I can watch Pixar, but I can also watch a

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.520
regular movie.

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:43.720
Right, we also have regular movies, we don't just have animated movies, right?

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:47.680
I mean, I've question or asked why I'm before this session, as we started this session.

01:34:47.680 --> 01:34:51.960
I actually don't know the answer, I don't think anyone's know the answer.

01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:56.440
We could have done this on the campus as an avatar, with voice.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:04.240
You know, there'd be three avatars standing in campus talking, four of us, sorry.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.240
Is it better?

01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:06.240
Really worse.

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:15.200
That we're projected on a two-dimensional screen and we can see your faces of this,

01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:17.000
I mean, in my mind, but yours.

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
I don't know, I don't know the answer, right?

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.000
I know which one's better.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.520
And I mean, I'm sure we'll do both, right?

01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.960
We'll try both over time.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:31.320
But it's a very interesting question to me.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:36.320
And I've thought about this the whole course.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.760
I sit in these sessions and these sessions are Zoom.

01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:46.760
And so we're projecting a Zoom into a 3D world.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:51.880
You're like, well, yeah, I'll add to that.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.040
I'll add one thing to that is that, yeah, we have been projected as a 2D on a speed.

01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.200
But I've been dancing with a bunch of people in the crowd for a while and like we did a

01:36:00.200 --> 01:36:04.120
bunch of different dances and the flash mode.

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:10.040
So I think my answer to this is that it will only take trying things out with people and

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.240
seeing what works and what doesn't work, et cetera.

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:21.280
There's no way to go and get the magic recipe of what is better to do a university course

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:23.040
in an immersive space.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:27.000
Maybe in the future, I will get back to this to feel the real emotions of people.

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.600
Maybe we'll have face tracking technologies that do it well.

01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:31.600
I don't know.

01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:37.280
But I think that our goal and I think our mission of all the people experimenting in

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:41.840
this is to actually experiment and try to see what does make sense, what does catch

01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:47.200
with people, what doesn't catch with people and try to navigate in that way.

01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:49.000
But yeah, if one thing I can say.

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.800
I agree, we're going to expand.

01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:56.960
But literally in this box, there's one of us who is not photo-realistic and that works

01:36:56.960 --> 01:36:58.440
and three of you were photo-realistic.

01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:01.440
And I was wondering the whole time wondering, which one's better?

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.160
I mean, if not, like I look at you and say, oh, really?

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.760
I wish Maxine would disappear and become an avatar.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:10.400
I like seeing you.

01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.560
And so the interesting question, OK, we have a couple of questions that come in.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:18.680
The first one I'm sending to Charlie because I don't expect you to have an official answer

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:19.680
to this.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.680
But I think it's a fair question.

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.880
For the general panel, but since you had mentioned all your cousins, I'm going to go

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:29.680
to you, what about the mental health aspects of eight to 10-year-olds or even 12-year-olds

01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:35.360
going directly into VR after school and not doing normal kid things like playing outside?

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.880
Oh, I guess you're...

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:43.080
I mean, yes, it's a big question.

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:50.720
When you're thinking about what's happening in terms of brain chemistry, is there a reason

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:57.400
that they're impacting their mental health negatively by feeling like they have a safe

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.160
space to socially interact so they can be themselves, where they can fully explore their

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:06.200
identity that maybe they might not have outside in a physical environment.

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.680
It's like it's such a sweeping generalization.

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:16.080
I think there's a lot that we've learned from Web2's social media about the impact of Web2

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:24.040
on mental health, especially where your identity and how much people like your identity in

01:38:24.040 --> 01:38:27.560
the digital world becomes kind of currency for status.

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:29.560
We've seen that that's a problem.

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.120
We have the opportunity now where we can be building out Web3 with all of the learnings

01:38:34.120 --> 01:38:39.880
of Web2 severely fucked up when it comes to mental health and started to try to address

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.520
those problems.

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:54.920
But I think it's a very like a cliched question.

01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:59.880
It's going to be healthier for a child to be participating in X space versus Y space

01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.360
because that's how I grew up.

01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:07.880
We don't really have the data to support that that's the case.

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:15.480
I certainly know a lot of people in the younger generation who have the opportunity to explore

01:39:15.480 --> 01:39:22.320
who they are via an alter ego where they aren't subject to the judgment of their peers, the

01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:27.960
fear of being documented and posted on Web2 social media by their peers.

01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:35.720
They can really start to experiment in a way that's become progressively harder with photo

01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:38.440
and video based social media.

01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:46.880
Arguably being avatar based in a VR space or within a game is healthier because they

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:53.040
get to do all these things that have been becoming more and more socially restrictive

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.040
over time.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:59.760
I think there's just so much nuance to this that gets missed when it's like, well, I

01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:04.760
grew up like this and I think it's bad that these kids aren't growing up the same way.

01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:09.720
Maxim, do you want to comment on this too?

01:40:09.720 --> 01:40:13.480
I think I have a very similar perspective.

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:21.720
I will add, I think it's a great question to ask but even more importantly, so as you

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.080
know, I'm sure a lot of you in the audience listening to this are considering going into

01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:28.000
crypto.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:35.000
I think the people prior to us, people building social media as we've been there in 2000 or

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:44.160
computers in the 90s might have had a path, a path for not having built a very strong

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:50.440
sort of answers to those questions because it was hard to prove that digital world could

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:51.960
have an adverse effect.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:59.040
I think now that we've seen that actually they can have an adverse effect, no one is

01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.480
like, oh, I'm so happy I spent 20 hours on Instagram this week.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:08.560
Not only do we observe that, I think it's good to be critical and my pushback to being

01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:16.760
critical would be very smart to surely most of the greatest cool stuff I've learned and

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:21.560
discovered about myself and that sort of became core part of who I am in my identity.

01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:23.360
That was through virtual worlds.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:32.760
So I do act as hard as I can to try to identify what could go wrong and try to fix it but

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:37.920
I'm not to miss that actually we can fix all of the stuff that might go wrong.

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:42.360
I'm going to also want to comment on this.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:46.680
I mean, like everything has been said, like they try to do a maxim, I don't know what

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:47.680
I could have really.

01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.240
It's interesting because like I hear in my like natural reactions, only that sounds

01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:58.720
worrisome and then I also remember when I was a boy guy, there was like all types of anxiety

01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:05.040
about video games and I spent my teenage years like every afternoon like my friends

01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:10.000
and sometimes you play basketball or whatever and sometimes we just send out my video games

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.000
all afternoon.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:18.440
And as far as I can tell, everyone grew up to be a responsible adult and like that was

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:19.440
fine.

01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:23.040
Like I mean, but if you listen to what people were saying then, I don't know, it was going

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:28.200
to be the end of the next generation of the total disaster and it was fine.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.600
Like everyone kind of grew up and had a perfectly real life and none of us seemed to have been

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.160
negatively affected by video games and now of course the studies come out and say like

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:40.680
maybe actually video games are good for you and you know who knows, not straight or but

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:48.320
like it certainly wasn't anything resembling the panic that for some reason if you're playing

01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:53.400
say our PlayStation or what have you, things were going to go wildly wrong in your life

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.400
like quite the opposite.

01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:55.400
It was a worst mutual.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:43:04.440
Okay, I have another quite general question which is hard but I think it's a good question.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.920
How do you see the metaverse, we can take this in reverse order and start with Ryan.

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:14.080
How do you see the metaverse impacting society and specifically what steps should be taken

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:16.960
to ensure it is inclusive and equitable for all?

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:20.480
That's a very broad scope to play.

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.000
Yeah, it's a very, very good question.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.840
I think to my point of my prediction within seven years, like I would have never guessed

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:30.600
that online I would be able to see so much beauty every single day.

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:34.640
I think by scrolling through my Twitter feed or going to on cyber like every single day

01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:43.120
I'm confronted with really, really cool stuff, new stuff I didn't know, art, creativity and

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.640
I think if anything what the metaverse has managed to accomplish until now for like a

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.720
short, a small group of people is to like democratize beauty and to make sure that people can access

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.040
culture and art in a way that they couldn't before.

01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:01.960
I think I personally like would access art just once every month, every month and a half

01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:07.280
whenever I would go to a gallery or go to like I don't know a museum or whatnot.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:13.760
But nowadays like every single day like I see new creations being put on on on on on

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:15.080
on Twitter being shared.

01:44:15.080 --> 01:44:17.360
They see news that new artists I didn't know.

01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:23.840
I get I get addicted to like certain art styles that I didn't know I liked.

01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:28.040
So I think that that's something that one positive that it managed to do.

01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:31.600
I think that one thing that we really have to do to make sure that this keeps on going

01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:37.040
is accessibility and to make sure that any creative from all across the world or any

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.760
art and joy or any person in general because we are all creators by default.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.840
We are all board creators.

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:44.680
We are all board collectors.

01:44:44.680 --> 01:44:49.560
We're all born art and joyers and like and and I think that the one thing we need to do

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:57.240
is to make sure that the the platforms are as accessible as possible to everyone.

01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:00.800
And that those platforms don't become the exact same platforms we're using now that

01:45:00.800 --> 01:45:06.680
are not accessible to everyone and that can love people out of their own accounts, etc.

01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.280
So I think that's one thing we need to do.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:13.280
But overall I think that if we managed to do that through the principles of decentralization,

01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:18.160
we get to a really, really good result that we I start seeing every single day today.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:23.440
I know a lot of people around me as well are seeing which is the market sizing belonging,

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:26.480
the market sizing culture, the market sizing beauty.

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:31.920
And I think it's really important for humans to be able to to be confronted with that as

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:32.920
well.

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:33.920
Sorry.

01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:43.600
Anyone else want to thank you for that?

01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:48.280
Yeah, I can jump in on that.

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:53.960
As I'm working specifically in digital identity, there's a huge way of responsibility when

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.760
we're thinking about like diversity and representation.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:02.960
You know, anybody that's building in the like habitat space, identity space.

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:08.760
You know, I think the first thing that's important, you know, where you know, building

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:15.400
web three now, we already have a much more diverse cross section of builders than we

01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:18.280
had in the earlier stages of the internet.

01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:22.720
So the first thing that's important thing, especially if you're creating around identity

01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:27.440
is making sure that everybody who is contributing to how that builds out and how you're representing

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:33.840
people that you haven't, you know, you have a very diverse cross section of opinions and

01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:37.120
cultures that are coming into the mix when you, you know, figure out how you're building

01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:39.600
that out.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:45.640
And then the other piece, as Ryan said, you know, everybody is fundamentally creative.

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:52.320
I mean, we've just seen over the last year how AI has started to democratize creativity,

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.320
right?

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:59.440
You don't need to be amazing at drawing to become an artist or become a creator.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:06.160
So I think, you know, for you as a human to like, you know, fulfill the full joy of the

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.000
human experience, you need to be able to create stuff.

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:15.960
So there is also a responsibility to democratize access to creation and technology is making

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:19.200
that increasingly easy.

01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:23.680
So I guess those are the two pieces that I'm focused on given that we're building for

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:29.280
identity and we're building for allowing people to easily create and customize their identity.

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:34.920
Yeah, if I can just finish this stuff, like there's a, there's a quote I read in Rick Ruben's

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:42.040
book, lately, Rick Ruben is a big, very famous music producer who's worked with people like

01:47:42.040 --> 01:47:46.520
it was was that the inception of Dev Jam in the 90s and worked with every single artist

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.520
you can think of.

01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:52.960
And like there's one quote of his that really, really struck by me and like my mission on

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:56.360
with on saver and I'll read it now.

01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:00.280
Regardless of whether or not we're formally making art, we're all living as artists.

01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.840
We perceive, perceive filter and collect data, then curate and experience for ourselves and

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:07.320
others based on this information set.

01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:12.160
Whether we do this consciously or unconsciously by the mere fact of being alive, we are active

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:16.000
participants in the ongoing process of creation.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.320
And I think that's really, really important as like to what we're doing in web three and

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:25.560
how we're able to just like bring this flame of creativity back to every single person.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.560
That's the participant.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.560
Great.

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:37.560
I have a question that I don't know what an answer to what I feel professionally obligated

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:38.560
to ask.

01:48:38.560 --> 01:48:41.560
Maxine, what is your headshot coming out?

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:44.560
Jane from the group.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.560
Okay.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.560
Unfortunity, we're enough communicating data community yet.

01:48:49.560 --> 01:48:56.560
However, you can email me and I'm adding people to our I'll find better at least all the time.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:02.400
Write me a short blurb about yourself where you come out of your and I'll do my best to

01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:04.560
add you to one of our spots.

01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:08.560
There's a second part of the question I suspect we're going to be answering and I'll ask

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:09.560
you also.

01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:11.560
Does your head said have a name yet?

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.560
What, sorry?

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.560
Does it have a name yet?

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:16.560
Oh, a name yet.

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:21.560
You can follow me on Twitter, I'll be announcing stuff pretty soon.

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.560
But sorry again, we've hired too many people from Apple and so we took that from them which

01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:29.560
I tried to be here to tell you about all the stuff.

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:36.560
Absolutely respect that but I had to shoot my shot on behalf of the studio audience.

01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:39.560
There's a question that I think I can answer.

01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:47.560
You can expect more avatars as NFTs for all integration and I think the answer is yes but

01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.560
probably I don't know.

01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:57.560
Two or three months away on various things so we're working on it and expect cool things

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.560
happening there.

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:01.560
Is that, we're here with that Ryan as an answer?

01:50:01.560 --> 01:50:03.560
Yeah, totally, totally.

01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.560
Again, as for everything we do, everything is experimental.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:12.560
We very often do QA in broad and so this was one of the examples where we just pushed

01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:19.560
avatars as quick as we could with a very optimized system so on the web right now we could render

01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:24.560
like a thousand avatars next to each other on an iPhone.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:31.560
We had to just have one to be able to achieve that feat and then be able to optimize more

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.560
to be able to add more I think within next two months yeah we'll be able to have many

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:42.560
more avatars and truly have like identity in the form of avatars within Unsamer.

01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:52.560
Okay, we are at time so I wanted to thank all three of our panelists for taking the time

01:50:52.560 --> 01:51:03.560
to meet with us, very much appreciate your insights.

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:12.560
We will turn this into an NFT soon and I think soon beyond that soon we'll have our better

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:19.560
organizational model and how we display all these both on the campus in the thirties case

01:51:19.560 --> 01:51:25.560
and also how people can find them on the web because like this panel there have been a lot

01:51:25.560 --> 01:51:30.560
of great panels and sessions and I think these are great things for people to watch whether

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:36.560
they were here today at specifically this time and so we want we think that's an important

01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:40.560
part of helping to educate the space so I appreciate you doing that.

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:45.560
We'll let you know once they're minted you can share the music we'll find a model where

01:51:45.560 --> 01:51:50.560
the content comes if people can open mint them into their wallet if you want to keep this

01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:56.560
for austerity sake making it immutable so you can show your grandchildren how wrong your

01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:07.560
predictions for 2031 and a model what we want so thank you very much.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.560
Thank you.

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:09.560
Thank you so much.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:10.560
There was awesome.

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.560
Thanks so much.

01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:15.560
Yeah thank you for having us does a pleasure.
