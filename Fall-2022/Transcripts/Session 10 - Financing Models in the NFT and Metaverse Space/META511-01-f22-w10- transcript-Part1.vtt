00:00.000 --> 00:21.940
Okay, super.

00:21.940 --> 00:29.580
Well, good evening, everyone, good afternoon, or good morning, depending where you are

00:29.580 --> 00:30.580
in the world.

00:30.580 --> 00:33.420
I know we have people from all over the world joining us today.

00:33.420 --> 00:39.980
This is session 10, financing models for NFTs and the metaverse, which is probably like,

00:39.980 --> 00:46.780
you know, financing models for organizations in this world.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.380
This is a very interesting topic.

00:49.380 --> 00:58.860
And it's also a very interesting topic to think about how we can do, in how we can handle

00:58.860 --> 01:03.020
in this period, because it's a very complicated topic.

01:03.020 --> 01:05.740
It is a very legally intensive topic.

01:05.740 --> 01:12.900
And it is a topic where even people with a ton of experience in this topic will go to

01:12.900 --> 01:23.460
specialized lawyers with even more experience in this topic to seek advice.

01:23.460 --> 01:32.540
And I know in our course we have a mixed level of knowledge about these types of topics.

01:32.540 --> 01:37.980
In fact, for I think many people, a very low level of knowledge about securities law,

01:37.980 --> 01:45.540
and I'm sure there's some people that have more advanced knowledge.

01:45.540 --> 01:51.180
The way I was thinking about this was, it would have been easy to overwhelm everyone with

01:51.180 --> 01:54.900
facts, figures, datas, cases, etc.

01:54.900 --> 02:00.860
But I'm not sure that helps anyone.

02:00.860 --> 02:14.260
Whereas I think what might be the right approach and the right answer here is leave with some

02:14.260 --> 02:20.380
very simple frameworks, some very simple ideas.

02:20.380 --> 02:29.140
And these simple ideas though, are applicable over and over and over and over again.

02:29.140 --> 02:34.140
I have, I think, a quite sophisticated understanding of this topic, but the way I think about it

02:34.140 --> 02:39.100
in practice is actually very simple.

02:39.100 --> 02:52.220
And so my goal today is to get less than 10 ideas in your head, maybe six or seven.

02:52.220 --> 02:56.380
And these ideas will help you in many different ways.

02:56.380 --> 03:03.260
They will explain why many things are the way they are in the financing environment.

03:03.260 --> 03:12.140
I see this constantly on my Twitter feed that people are confused about why things are financed

03:12.140 --> 03:14.700
the way they are financed.

03:14.700 --> 03:22.060
We will see where the risky areas are and where legal risk might be.

03:22.060 --> 03:28.020
Now, you're not going to learn the legal risk from this course.

03:28.020 --> 03:38.140
What you should learn is when you're within 100 miles of potential legal risk so that

03:38.140 --> 03:44.940
you go find someone qualified, a securities attorney, or really what you want, to help

03:44.940 --> 03:49.700
you think through what your legal risk might be.

03:49.700 --> 03:59.500
This is what I hope to accomplish today and so I really simplified my slides and I hope

03:59.500 --> 04:00.900
this will work.

04:00.900 --> 04:07.860
So let's jump in.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.380
And really there's two things.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.220
We're going to go into two sections.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.220
What are the key frameworks within US securities law that change financing models?

04:18.220 --> 04:24.540
I'm going to go into the financial, that's the financing models in use today.

04:24.540 --> 04:31.540
And you'll notice I'm going to be focused exclusively on US law.

04:31.540 --> 04:41.900
And the framework that we will cover here is a very US-specific framework.

04:41.900 --> 04:49.020
Almost no other country thinks about it in exactly this way.

04:49.020 --> 04:54.220
And then you might say, well, why are we doing that?

04:54.220 --> 04:55.220
It's a global field.

04:55.220 --> 04:57.340
It's a global industry.

04:57.340 --> 05:02.380
Why are we just focused on what the Americans are doing?

05:02.380 --> 05:14.940
And the reality is, the reason this is the case is that the startup industry in general

05:14.940 --> 05:23.860
and I think very large parts of the crypto industry in general and large parts of the

05:23.860 --> 05:30.220
NFT and the metaverse industry in general and the broader technology industry in general

05:30.220 --> 05:44.260
in the broadly speaking English language world or Europe and US world tends to be concentrated

05:44.260 --> 05:46.260
in the United States.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.420
China has a very different model.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.580
Russia has a different model.

05:50.580 --> 06:04.500
But in the world that public blockchains are heavily used in that world, what we tend to

06:04.500 --> 06:12.100
see is that there's a heavy concentration in the United States.

06:12.100 --> 06:18.740
And given that heavy concentration in the United States, the laws and regulations of

06:18.740 --> 06:33.260
the United States tend to be fairly, they shape the space for everyone else.

06:33.260 --> 06:41.060
And so a lot of what you see is the United States, it might be very specific to America,

06:41.060 --> 06:44.940
but it really does shape the space tremendously in a lot of what we see.

06:44.940 --> 06:48.500
So this is what we're going to talk about.

06:48.500 --> 06:56.740
I can't possibly disclaim this session enough, like this is not legal advice.

06:56.740 --> 07:00.460
It wouldn't even be legal advice in the United States and the United States should still

07:00.460 --> 07:06.860
set a, I know 20 times more than this presentation and I wouldn't do any of these things without

07:06.860 --> 07:07.860
a lawyer.

07:07.860 --> 07:13.180
And it certainly doesn't apply outside the United States because these are the US rules.

07:13.180 --> 07:22.060
So with all of these caveats and all of these ideas, let's jump in.

07:22.060 --> 07:29.140
And I was laughing when I wrote the title for the section, some relevant snippets of US

07:29.140 --> 07:30.980
securities law, and this is exactly what it is.

07:30.980 --> 07:37.740
US securities law is a gigantic body of work, of case law, with all types of nuanced and

07:37.740 --> 07:45.180
edge to edge cases that have been over time established.

07:45.180 --> 07:52.780
And here we're going to have four slides and fairly large font to talk about.

07:52.780 --> 08:03.980
But what I was trying to do is distill the parts that might matter for people and might

08:03.980 --> 08:08.820
matter in a practical way.

08:08.820 --> 08:14.500
So this is how does, where does all come from, actually came from the Great Depression.

08:14.500 --> 08:20.060
It is wild, but it's true.

08:20.060 --> 08:26.620
The basis for most of these laws is from 1933 and 1934.

08:26.620 --> 08:29.580
Now there have been modifications of these laws of run.

08:29.580 --> 08:40.300
They have been new laws over time, but the basic laws are from there.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.300
It's all we need to know for the slides.

08:43.300 --> 08:47.140
That's all we need to know.

08:47.140 --> 08:56.940
Now, here is the single most important concept you need to learn today.

08:56.940 --> 09:11.380
And quite frankly, the single most explanatory concept in the whole financing world of startups

09:11.380 --> 09:17.540
and crypto assets in general, of which NFTs and Metaverse are a subset.

09:17.540 --> 09:32.580
The concept is that the United States defines a security that needs to be registered using

09:32.580 --> 09:36.460
the Howey Test.

09:36.460 --> 09:44.820
And it is not designed prescriptively as it is in other jurisdictions.

09:44.820 --> 09:55.980
So in many other jurisdictions, people or legislators say, a security is these 17 specific

09:55.980 --> 10:09.900
things, derivative contracts, bonds, options on publicly traded securities, etc, etc, etc.

10:09.900 --> 10:15.700
And so you can go down the list and say, is my thing one of these things?

10:15.700 --> 10:29.700
And if the answer is no, then it's not a security and you can kind of go off and do whatever I'm

10:29.700 --> 10:33.060
planning to do.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.900
The United States is different.

10:35.900 --> 10:41.260
It's principles based in how it approaches this.

10:41.260 --> 10:53.140
And in that case, you have to analyze each specific potential security individually.

10:53.140 --> 10:56.820
And the principles are quite abstract.

10:56.820 --> 11:00.540
They fit here on this page.

11:00.540 --> 11:09.420
And what this is, how we test this is, you need to look at this potential security and ask

11:09.420 --> 11:12.020
yourself four questions.

11:12.020 --> 11:21.180
And if the answer is yes, to all four questions, then it's a security.

11:21.180 --> 11:27.180
And if the answer is no, to any one of the four questions, it's not.

11:27.180 --> 11:31.220
And if you know, that's great, it's going to be hard to become a security.

11:31.220 --> 11:39.660
And the reality is is most things that most people will think of, most casual, naive or

11:39.660 --> 11:45.260
even like, kind of medium sophisticated ideas that people will think of for raising money

11:45.260 --> 11:51.460
do turn out to be securities under this test, which is bizarre, but yet true.

11:51.460 --> 11:53.900
So let's go through them.

11:53.900 --> 11:57.940
The first part of the task is an investment of money.

11:57.940 --> 12:01.780
This is the most straightforward.

12:01.780 --> 12:08.020
If you're volunteering at your local church, this is not going to be a security.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.180
This is an investment of money.

12:10.180 --> 12:23.220
Now money doesn't mean fiat dollars if you sell a security and you take, Ethereum,

12:23.220 --> 12:27.100
for example, that's still going to meet this test.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.340
So it can be considered an investment of money.

12:29.340 --> 12:35.300
It's not an investment of US dollars, investment of money more broadly.

12:35.300 --> 12:39.300
The second test in a common enterprise.

12:39.300 --> 12:50.580
So this is the way I think about it is something that has a definable mission, organision, goal etc.

12:50.580 --> 13:02.580
It's interesting people try and get around this by saying, oh, but there's not a legal

13:02.580 --> 13:17.780
entity here or, we call ourselves decentralized, but that doesn't matter so much.

13:17.780 --> 13:26.860
Like the SEC is going to look at this point conceptually, that this a common enterprise

13:26.860 --> 13:31.500
where, we're going to try and do something together.

13:31.500 --> 13:36.940
And the most simple base example is, a company.

13:36.940 --> 13:50.820
So if I founded a company and this company was supposed to sell NFTs, and it was called

13:50.820 --> 13:57.580
6529 NFT Limited or Incorporated.

13:57.580 --> 14:00.820
And I say, would you like to buy shares in my company?

14:00.820 --> 14:05.220
Yeah, it's a common enterprise where other companies were going to do something.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.900
So the interesting thing is, like, no, I'm not going to do it with a company.

14:08.900 --> 14:12.860
I'm just going to sell you these tokens and we're decentralized,

14:12.860 --> 14:15.060
and it doesn't matter so much,

14:15.060 --> 14:18.580
like the legal form doesn't matter so much.

14:18.580 --> 14:24.020
Does this have a coherent and cohesive set of activities?

14:24.020 --> 14:32.900
The third leg of the stool with the expectation of profits.

14:32.900 --> 14:43.820
Are people buying what it is you're selling for the way they are buying any other investment

14:43.820 --> 14:52.180
vehicle?

14:52.180 --> 15:01.100
If someone sells you a very nice six course dinner, it might be an investment of money

15:01.100 --> 15:04.500
in a common enterprise that I've run, but not buying with an expectation of profits.

15:04.500 --> 15:12.460
So someone sells you a pair of NIKE shoes, not buying them with an expectation of profit.

15:12.460 --> 15:17.780
I'll hold that example and come back to it later.

15:17.780 --> 15:31.260
If someone sells you a boost-up in a game, probably not something smart for the expectation

15:31.260 --> 15:33.900
of profits.

15:33.900 --> 15:50.060
If someone sells you something that says, yeah, buy this token, we are going to moon because

15:50.060 --> 15:55.820
of ABCDE reason, we start to get problematic.

15:55.820 --> 16:01.620
We still have to meet all the tests, but we start to get problematic.

16:01.620 --> 16:07.140
By the way, dumb level disclaimers don't work.

16:07.140 --> 16:10.660
So you see this all the time in our space.

16:10.660 --> 16:16.620
Someone says something that is absolutely, certainly, without a doubt, financial advice,

16:16.620 --> 16:20.420
and then at the bottom of their Tweet says, not financial advice, NFA,

16:20.420 --> 16:24.100
it doesn't count for anything, doesn't mean anything.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.900
Nothing about that is relevant.

16:26.900 --> 16:32.180
The substance is what you do.

16:32.180 --> 16:41.900
Fourth part, to be derived from the efforts of others.

16:41.900 --> 16:50.060
And this is the part that crypto teams really try and focus on.

16:50.060 --> 17:05.420
Which is saying, is there an identifiable group of people who are working to make this

17:05.420 --> 17:07.220
a success?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.380
Are there insiders?

17:08.380 --> 17:19.580
And the reason it's interesting from a regulatory perspective if there are insiders, the theory here

17:19.580 --> 17:28.500
about legislation, disclosure, and what have you, is about information asymmetry.

17:28.500 --> 17:34.700
If there are insiders, they might know more about the project than you do.

17:34.700 --> 17:47.980
And if they know more about the project than you do, then they might withhold information

17:47.980 --> 17:54.700
from you and sell you a security.

17:54.700 --> 17:58.780
And you might be taken advantage of.

17:58.780 --> 18:01.180
What's something that would not meet this test?

18:01.180 --> 18:08.460
Well, very famously, the United States has said and continues to say that Bitcoin is not

18:08.460 --> 18:11.260
a security.

18:11.260 --> 18:22.060
And they believe that a combination of mining and wallet holding and how transactions are

18:22.060 --> 18:29.540
processed is sufficiently decentralized.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.540
But the fourth leg doesn't get triggered.

18:32.540 --> 18:38.220
There's kind of other two legs do exist for Bitcoin, right?

18:38.220 --> 18:41.500
People buy Bitcoin, an investment of money.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.340
Bitcoin is kind of an obvious common enterprise, right?

18:44.340 --> 18:48.740
Trying to make a store value or payment network.

18:48.740 --> 18:58.380
Most people are buying Bitcoin with the hope that the price of Bitcoin goes up.

18:58.380 --> 19:14.620
But the, they're saying it's not an identifiable team that's driving the value of Bitcoin and

19:14.620 --> 19:19.140
that it's derived from the efforts of others.

19:19.140 --> 19:22.220
It's like a commodity.

19:22.220 --> 19:33.780
It's like, if you buy a barrel of oil, people say, oh, well, no, that's not a security.

19:33.780 --> 19:39.860
No, is the value of oil in some very, very weird abstract way derived also from the

19:39.860 --> 19:40.860
efforts of others?

19:40.860 --> 19:51.620
Sure, sort of, but there's not like one producer of oil that has specific power over

19:51.620 --> 19:54.540
the characteristics of oil.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.780
There's many producers around the world.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.540
There's many users around the world.

19:59.540 --> 20:05.740
There's no real information asymmetry in oil that someone needs to come and disclose.

20:05.740 --> 20:15.980
And it's viewed, for example, that Bitcoin has also reached that point of decentralization,

20:15.980 --> 20:19.100
if not information asymmetry.

20:19.100 --> 20:26.940
So what are things that almost certainly are securities in the token space?

20:26.940 --> 20:35.420
Obviously, if I, we had said, if we have 6529, NFTs Inc, and I go out and say,

20:35.420 --> 20:40.420
hey, would you like to buy 10 of the 100 shares?

20:40.420 --> 20:42.580
I have this really great idea.

20:42.580 --> 20:46.420
I'm going to mint NFTs and Tweet about them.

20:46.420 --> 20:49.660
We're going to make lots of money together.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.540
That is a trivial security.

20:52.540 --> 20:56.820
It's an investment of money and a common enterprise and expectation of prices to be derived from

20:56.820 --> 20:58.580
the efforts of others, aka me.

20:58.580 --> 21:07.900
Where a lot of people go wrong is they say, oh, well, if we do this as a token, we're

21:07.900 --> 21:09.980
somehow going to get away from this, right?

21:09.980 --> 21:23.340
If we say, oh, we're going to mint 6529 Dow tokens, and they're going to get a

21:23.340 --> 21:35.060
share of the revenue from all the other NFTs 6529 mints, without going into great

21:35.060 --> 21:43.380
detail in the situation specific areas, that has risked that it's a token security.

21:43.380 --> 21:48.740
The fact that it's not specifically shares in the company doesn't change anything.

21:48.740 --> 21:52.340
It's an investment of money and a common enterprise expectation of profit to be derived by the

21:52.340 --> 21:53.340
efforts of others.

21:53.340 --> 22:01.380
The fact that I said it's a token, not shares in the company, doesn't really count for anything.

22:01.380 --> 22:10.460
So if there's only one thing you remember today, it's this.

22:10.460 --> 22:17.420
Remember these four prongs, it's like 15 words.

22:17.420 --> 22:23.740
And when you see someone offering something as of does this, is this likely to look like

22:23.740 --> 22:24.740
this, right?

22:24.740 --> 22:31.380
It's okay, well, so what does it matter if it's a security?

22:31.380 --> 22:39.820
Well it matters because if it is a security in the United States, and I'm going to summarize

22:39.820 --> 22:51.100
but this is effectively right, you either have to, A, register it with the Securities and

22:51.100 --> 22:53.060
Exchange Commission.

22:53.060 --> 23:06.900
B, sell it only to a certain set of sophisticated investors, or C, take advantage of the crowdfunding

23:06.900 --> 23:07.900
exemptions registration.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.340
These are your only options.

23:10.340 --> 23:16.580
There's no fourth option for practical purposes.

23:16.580 --> 23:25.540
So, who are these sophisticated investors who can buy unregistered securities?

23:25.540 --> 23:32.220
They fall into two categories, Accredited Investors and Qualified Purchasers.

23:32.220 --> 23:38.220
Accredited Investors is the one you hear about casually.

23:38.220 --> 23:44.060
Online, it's the bigger category, it's the more common category, it's the lower standards

23:44.060 --> 23:50.580
category, Qualified Purchasers is a more institutional category.

23:50.580 --> 24:06.500
Don't 100% quote me on this, but the, the, I think every Qualified Purchaser is also

24:06.500 --> 24:11.620
an Accredited Investor, but not all Accredited Investors are Qualified Purchasers, I believe

24:11.620 --> 24:12.620
that's correct.

24:12.620 --> 24:16.820
Let's look at that Accredited Investor standards.

24:16.820 --> 24:21.020
You have to meet one of the standards, not all of them.

24:21.020 --> 24:28.060
You have annual income over $200,000 for the last two years or $300,000 if you include

24:28.060 --> 24:34.220
your spouse or partner, and you believe, you have a reasonable belief that supplies for

24:34.220 --> 24:36.380
the upcoming years.

24:36.380 --> 24:44.700
Or you have a net worth of over a million dollars excluding your primary residence.

24:44.700 --> 24:50.820
So excluding your home equity.

24:50.820 --> 24:57.660
This can also be jointly with your spouse or partner.

24:57.660 --> 25:03.020
Or, you meet certain professional criteria.

25:03.020 --> 25:09.100
You hold one of the securities industry certifications licenses that you've studied and passed the

25:09.100 --> 25:13.420
test work, Series 765 or E2.

25:13.420 --> 25:20.980
You're a high level officer, director in the company that's selling the security.

25:20.980 --> 25:27.300
You're a client in the family office, it's itself a credit investor.

25:27.300 --> 25:30.820
Or for in a fund, you're a knowledgeable employee of the fund.

25:30.820 --> 25:35.580
Or there's some other legal rules for legal entities.

25:35.580 --> 25:45.340
But basically, it is you're rich or kind of rich,

25:45.340 --> 25:48.500
or, you have financial services expertise.

25:48.500 --> 25:58.100
A Qualified Purchaser is similar type of things but with higher numbers, 5 million up to 25 million.

25:58.100 --> 26:01.740
We can ignore it for the purposes of discussion.

26:01.740 --> 26:13.340
And the theory here is, either you're rich, in which case if you go buy an unregistered

26:13.340 --> 26:23.940
security and you want given all the information you needed to properly evaluate it,

26:23.940 --> 26:38.460
and it turns out that it was risky and it turns out that you lose your money.

26:38.460 --> 26:42.580
Well, it's okay, you're rich.

26:42.580 --> 26:45.420
You can survive it.

26:45.420 --> 26:47.980
That's theory one.

26:47.980 --> 26:59.900
Theory two is, well maybe you're not rich but maybe you're like, have deep expertise in the financial services

26:59.900 --> 27:02.940
industry or meet the professional criteria

27:02.940 --> 27:07.140
and so you can take care of yourself.

27:07.140 --> 27:11.060
You can make the correct decisions.

27:11.060 --> 27:18.100
It is a paternalistic model of regulation.

27:18.100 --> 27:23.140
It divides the world into two buckets.

27:23.140 --> 27:30.060
It divides the world into people who can make these decisions by themselves and either have

27:30.060 --> 27:36.900
the expertise to make good decisions or the financial wherewithal not to be wrecked by

27:36.900 --> 27:37.900
these decisions.

27:37.900 --> 27:46.540
Which is not to say that people who make $200,000 a year couldn't buy an unregistered,

27:46.540 --> 27:53.340
a sufficiently large amount of an unregistered security to also destroy their lives financially.

27:53.340 --> 28:02.380
It's not actually the case that they won't do that.

28:02.380 --> 28:07.620
And then people will you say look, it's too risky for you.

28:07.620 --> 28:16.420
You need more protection, more information, less risk of information asymmetry. For people

28:16.420 --> 28:20.740
to be able to sell this to you,

28:20.740 --> 28:31.500
they need to come in and disclose a lot more information.

28:31.500 --> 28:45.740
The... I think this was sort of uncontroversial a few decades ago.

28:45.740 --> 28:55.900
And with the democratization of finance in general, the internet in general,

28:55.900 --> 29:02.700
and then really much more so with crypto.

29:02.700 --> 29:12.740
I think there's an interesting debate on this. This debate, by the way, tends to lean one way

29:12.740 --> 29:16.540
when prices are going up and a different way when prices are going down.

29:16.540 --> 29:25.500
But there's an interesting debate on if this is for the good of the people who are not

29:25.500 --> 29:27.900
Accredited Investors or if it's bad for them, you know.

29:27.900 --> 29:36.980
Does it exclude them from exciting and potentially valuable investment opportunities, or does it

29:36.980 --> 29:41.020
protect them from scams?

29:41.020 --> 29:49.300
Is this excellent protection for the unsophisticated or is this a way for the rich to get richer

29:49.300 --> 29:57.060
and everyone else not to have access to the same opportunities?

29:57.060 --> 30:11.580
There is also, you know, some people who feel that this legislation is no longer exactly right.

30:11.580 --> 30:13.580
Many states allow gambling.

30:13.580 --> 30:18.860
They allow lotteries.

30:18.860 --> 30:22.900
Those things are obviously bad for the unsophisticated.

30:22.900 --> 30:29.580
They allow anyone to participate in them.

30:29.580 --> 30:32.940
Seems strange that this would be allowed.

30:32.940 --> 30:37.620
They're allowed to invest, quote unquote, in lottery tickets, but they're not allowed

30:37.620 --> 30:41.460
to invest in potentially, a bad investment.

30:41.460 --> 30:48.100
We're not going to conclude on this topic, but these are the types of issues that are...

30:48.100 --> 30:49.100
Right.

30:49.100 --> 30:53.700
So this is who is allowed to purchase unregistered securities.

30:53.700 --> 30:56.620
Now what does registration mean?

30:56.620 --> 30:59.420
Basically you have to file for an IPO.

30:59.420 --> 31:04.460
It's that type of, well, we have to make an S1 as a registration statement.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.620
You send it to the SEC.

31:06.620 --> 31:07.620
They read it.

31:07.620 --> 31:08.620
They ask you questions.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.620
They ask you to make changes.

31:09.620 --> 31:10.620
You send it back.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.620
They read it.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.260
So on and so forth.

31:13.260 --> 31:21.980
And then you can sell, generally, shares to the public or other financial instruments, which

31:21.980 --> 31:22.980
generally shares.

31:22.980 --> 31:27.100
And then you have a whole bunch of ongoing reporting requirements.

31:27.100 --> 31:31.020
When do you have to file financial statements with the SEC?

31:31.020 --> 31:33.820
What things do you need to disclose?

31:33.820 --> 31:35.620
What are your officers doing?

31:35.620 --> 31:37.740
Are they buying or selling shares?

31:37.740 --> 31:38.940
When are they trading?

31:38.940 --> 31:41.340
When are they not trading?

31:41.340 --> 31:44.940
All of these things are actually pretty good things.

31:44.940 --> 31:59.820
But, they are things that are hard to do in a natively crypto context.

31:59.820 --> 32:05.180
But they're also expensive.

32:05.180 --> 32:11.820
Even for a fairly small company preparing to file, or do a registration, will be a seven

32:11.820 --> 32:16.780
figure cost and probably seven figures of annual compliance.

32:16.780 --> 32:27.220
And so you can't really be a person who wants to run a half million dollar common enterprise

32:27.220 --> 32:29.420
and practically speaking, file.

32:29.420 --> 32:33.500
So they say, well, okay,

32:33.500 --> 32:34.500
we have a solution for that,

32:34.500 --> 32:38.020
that's the crowdfunding exemption,

32:38.020 --> 32:39.500
and this is Reg A.

32:39.500 --> 32:46.980
Reg A is the exemptions to registration.

32:46.980 --> 33:01.300
But there was a specific one done for crowdfunding.

33:01.300 --> 33:13.180
You can do effectively a light form of registration if you're crowdfunding within certain hurdles,

33:13.180 --> 33:17.340
20 million and 75 million respectively.

33:17.340 --> 33:25.260
And so you don't have to go through the whole full regulatory regime of being a public company

33:25.260 --> 33:27.820
like Google.

33:27.820 --> 33:31.420
You do have some reporting requirements, you can't just go out there and put your hand

33:31.420 --> 33:32.420
up and say, hey, look, I'm crowdfunding,

33:32.420 --> 33:33.420
I don't have to do anything.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.660
That's not how it works.

33:35.660 --> 33:36.820
But it's a lighter form,

33:36.820 --> 33:40.060
it's a significantly lighter registration form.

33:40.060 --> 33:55.620
So, practically speaking, if something is a security, you can sell it using one of three

33:55.620 --> 34:06.020
ways. One, to Acredited Investors and Qualified Purchasers. Two, to the public, host registration.

34:06.020 --> 34:14.340
Three, to the public under the crowdfunding exemptions, but within certain limits on how

34:14.340 --> 34:18.500
much you can raise.

34:18.500 --> 34:23.700
These are, or if it's not a security, you don't have to do any of these things, but then it

34:23.700 --> 34:31.580
really has to not be a security.

34:31.580 --> 34:37.060
On this section, this is what I would like you to remember.

34:37.060 --> 34:45.460
The Howey Test and these three models for securities, Acredited Investors, registration,

34:45.460 --> 34:47.660
Reg A crowdfunding exemptions.

34:47.660 --> 34:54.660
Now, how does this translate to real life?

34:54.660 --> 34:57.660
How does this translate to what people do?

34:57.660 --> 35:09.460
Well, the primary model for financing technology startups, remains venture capital firms.

35:09.460 --> 35:13.020
What are venture capital firms?

35:13.020 --> 35:25.500
Venture capital firms are investment funds who have a general partner who is a company,

35:25.500 --> 35:33.740
but you can think of it as the people running the fund, and limited partners, who are the

35:33.740 --> 35:34.740
investors.

35:34.740 --> 35:40.380
The investors and venture capital funds are Accredited Investors or Qualified Purchasers

35:40.380 --> 35:45.020
because units of a venture capital fund are definitely securities.

35:45.020 --> 35:49.540
And who are these famous institutional investors?

35:49.540 --> 36:03.900
Well, interestingly, the largest institutional investors in the world are pension funds.

36:03.900 --> 36:09.900
So, it's kind of funny that like, when you think of institutional investors and they're very big

36:09.900 --> 36:18.260
and not like a common person, it's primarily the retirement savings of school teachers

36:18.260 --> 36:25.180
and firefighters that have been aggregated, but because they have been aggregated, a very large

36:25.180 --> 36:30.260
number, will then have people managing those retirement savings.

36:30.260 --> 36:38.980
A one of the things those people do is invest those retirement savings into venture capital

36:38.980 --> 36:45.980
funds will then go and invest in the service.

36:45.980 --> 37:02.020
Other buckets of typical investors, sovereign wealth funds, some corporate treasurers, family

37:02.020 --> 37:11.300
offices, which is just a fancy word for effectively, an investment team for a really, really rich

37:11.300 --> 37:12.300
family.

37:12.300 --> 37:16.660
An ultra high net worth or a high net worth individuals.

37:16.660 --> 37:20.460
But really the biggest investor in venture capital funds tends to be pension funds,

37:20.460 --> 37:23.860
they have more money than any of these people.

37:23.860 --> 37:38.340
So VCs are both allowed to invest in unregistered securities and also have the orientation skill,

37:38.340 --> 37:46.020
mental desire to invest in technology startups.

37:46.020 --> 37:58.340
The... most of the, pretty much all of the infrastructure firms in NFT space, all of the gaming firms

37:58.340 --> 38:05.860
in NFT space, many of the metaverse firms in NFT space and some of the project teams

38:05.860 --> 38:15.940
in the NFT space, Yuga, dual, etc etc, have raised money from venture capital funds.

38:15.940 --> 38:18.300
Why?

38:18.300 --> 38:25.860
Because it is safe, easy and fast.

38:25.860 --> 38:34.900
Venture capital firms can make a decision fairly quickly, and by making that decision,

38:34.900 --> 38:41.380
they can write a cheque, for $2, $5, $10, $20 million.

38:41.380 --> 38:45.540
You do not, you can sell them normal equity,

38:45.540 --> 38:54.740
you don't have to go through any complicated convolutions of designing some unique instrument

38:54.740 --> 38:56.740
to make sure that it's not a security.

38:56.740 --> 39:06.300
You know, say, look, you can buy shares in our company and you, the entrepreneur, don't

39:06.300 --> 39:11.660
have to worry about any regulatory risk.

39:11.660 --> 39:23.300
They're very much allowed to buy shares in your company, and this practical aspect tends

39:23.300 --> 39:29.340
to be fairly dominant in how these firms are financed because most of the other ways

39:29.340 --> 39:34.540
you can do it, are actually pretty complicated.

39:34.540 --> 39:46.220
You're certainly, you're certainly not going to go registered to go public as a startup,

39:46.220 --> 39:47.220
right?

39:47.220 --> 39:50.420
You don't have the capacity or the money, you're not right, mature enough.

39:50.420 --> 39:57.420
So this tends to be if you're going to sell a security, a very easy and fast way to do

39:57.420 --> 39:58.420
it.

39:58.420 --> 40:00.620
What else are we seeing?

40:00.620 --> 40:09.900
Well, we see DAOs and DAOs is one of my pet peeves in the space because DAO literally

40:09.900 --> 40:12.540
means something very different.

40:12.540 --> 40:19.900
It says it right there in its name, Decentralized Autonomous Organization.

40:19.900 --> 40:27.620
DAOs were meant to be something like smart contracts that engaged in economic activity.

40:27.620 --> 40:35.380
They were actually decentralized and autonomous when first thought of in this way.

40:35.380 --> 40:39.060
Today people use the word now very differently.

40:39.060 --> 40:43.380
They use it as a group of people doing something.

40:43.380 --> 40:52.180
A group of people doing something is neither decentralized nor is it autonomous.

40:52.180 --> 40:58.900
It is, a group of people doing something.

40:58.900 --> 41:05.700
And when you have a group of people doing something, if they're not careful, one of the

41:05.700 --> 41:11.900
things they will discover they are doing, is selling unregistered securities to people.

41:11.900 --> 41:19.940
So my conceptual problems with the way that terms are being used aside, what do we see

41:19.940 --> 41:23.100
in terms of DAOs in the NFT space?

41:23.100 --> 41:33.500
Well, we see DAOs that are effectively correctly legally organized and compliant.

41:33.500 --> 41:40.540
These DAOs usually have registered a company, an LLC.

41:40.540 --> 41:51.860
They usually KYC check the information and write down your name and social security number

41:51.860 --> 41:55.700
and address of everyone investing.

41:55.700 --> 42:05.740
And they ask them to provide documentation or self-certification that they are accredited

42:05.740 --> 42:06.740
investors.

42:06.740 --> 42:13.260
A good example of this is Flamingo DAO.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.900
Flamingo DAO does all these things.

42:15.900 --> 42:23.740
It is a DAO, they call themselves a DAO, but effectively they're a company.

42:23.740 --> 42:34.740
And effectively they comply with similar hurdles for their members as venture capital funders.

42:34.740 --> 42:40.020
There are some differences in how they make decisions.

42:40.020 --> 42:47.100
All the down members can contribute to decisions, where the venture capital fund investors typically

42:47.100 --> 42:49.980
do not contribute to the decisions.

42:49.980 --> 42:57.100
But from a legal financial infrastructure perspective, it's very, very similar.

42:57.100 --> 43:07.500
Then there's what the NFT projects tend to call DAOs, which are all over the map, very

43:07.500 --> 43:10.500
poorly organized.

43:10.500 --> 43:15.900
I think in many cases very poorly thought out.

43:15.900 --> 43:28.940
And some of them are going to get in trouble because they are in fact, the type of activity

43:28.940 --> 43:32.620
that really should only be opened under US law, without judging whether it's right or

43:32.620 --> 43:39.180
wrong, to Accredited Investors and they're not limiting to Accredited Investors.

43:39.180 --> 43:51.060
And some of them are not going to get in trouble with the SEC in any way, but are kind of lying

43:51.060 --> 43:53.500
to the members.

43:53.500 --> 44:03.580
You know, you see DAOs of the type that say, oh, you're a DAO, and you're in the DAO if you own the

44:03.580 --> 44:04.740
projects NFTs.

44:04.740 --> 44:11.460
But the equity is owned by someone else, the governance of that equity is owned by someone

44:11.460 --> 44:14.660
else, the decisions are all made by someone else

44:14.660 --> 44:20.940
and sure, there's a DAO council and they'll ask the people their opinions here or there.

44:20.940 --> 44:27.420
Well, I mean, that's no different than having a customer advisory board.

44:27.420 --> 44:34.500
It's just if you told people, if you bought this NFT, you're part of our customer advisory

44:34.500 --> 44:38.860
board or community advisory board.

44:38.860 --> 44:44.300
It doesn't sound as appealing as being part of the DAO.

44:44.300 --> 44:51.260
And so what's going on there is I think they're misleading people for people to attribute more

44:51.260 --> 44:55.340
value to their token.

44:55.340 --> 44:59.020
And it's not great.

44:59.020 --> 45:09.060
I think it's going to be very hard for most non-legally organized DAOs to operate in a

45:09.060 --> 45:12.580
compliant manner the way they're doing it.

45:12.580 --> 45:17.340
I'm not going to judge any specific project.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.900
I don't know all the facts of an expert projects.

45:20.900 --> 45:28.780
But I believe there's certain quote unquote DAOs operating in the space that effectively, are

45:28.780 --> 45:30.820
violating security law.

45:30.820 --> 45:37.980
They might not be doing it on purpose, but they are effectively doing it.

45:37.980 --> 45:39.540
Well, Token Offerings.

45:39.540 --> 45:48.140
This is a very big deal in the quote unquote ICO era of 2017-2018, where everyone and their

45:48.140 --> 45:55.180
brother, mother, sister, parent was going around saying, well, we're going to do ICO.

45:55.180 --> 45:58.260
We're going to sell you this token,

45:58.260 --> 46:00.660
it will fund our operation, 

46:00.660 --> 46:12.300
and we're going to make the "X for Y", the token for doctors to organize their medical practices,

46:12.300 --> 46:15.380
or what have you.

46:15.380 --> 46:22.820
The reality is the vast majority of these ICOs were actually securities,

46:22.820 --> 46:30.540
and eventually the SEC cracked down on them,

46:30.540 --> 46:35.500
and people stopped doing it because they don't want to get in trouble.

46:35.500 --> 46:46.500
I believe a typical fungible token ICO is very hard to do as a not a security.

46:46.500 --> 46:55.140
Or if I want to be more precise, it is very hard to make it not a security, but also achieve

46:55.140 --> 47:05.340
the objectives that the organizer of the token is likely trying to achieve.

47:05.340 --> 47:08.780
What do I mean by that?

47:08.780 --> 47:23.020
Well, most of the time people who are doing an ICO are trying to raise money to do something.

47:23.020 --> 47:24.020
They have an idea.

47:24.020 --> 47:30.020
They woke up one morning and said, oh, I want to do, execute this idea,

47:30.020 --> 47:35.220
I know I need a team to do it and in order to get that team, I need money to hire that

47:35.220 --> 47:40.580
team and to do marketing and what have you.

47:40.580 --> 47:51.180
And because of this, I need to raise money.

47:51.180 --> 48:00.260
The reality is most things of that genre are going to end up meeting the Howey Test.

48:00.260 --> 48:06.940
You're going to sell the token to people who are going to buy it with an expectation

48:06.940 --> 48:07.940
of profit.

48:07.940 --> 48:11.260
It's definitely an investment of money.

48:11.260 --> 48:15.220
There's almost certainly a common enterprise.

48:15.220 --> 48:24.900
And, it is most likely reliant on the efforts of others, namely you.

48:24.900 --> 48:38.140
And so the issue here is you can make a token offering that is not a security,

48:38.140 --> 48:41.180
it's just unlikely that you want to.

48:41.180 --> 48:48.460
But that's usually where the problem was, not that it's impossible to do it.

48:48.460 --> 48:53.420
It's just that once you do it, it's not likely to meet your objectives because your objectives

48:53.420 --> 48:56.700
usually work.

48:56.700 --> 49:03.660
Of the... in the genre of, I want to build something and I need money to build something and I'm

49:03.660 --> 49:08.740
the person who's going to build that thing that I'm trying to build,

49:08.740 --> 49:18.900
and that ends up generally likely not being sufficiently decentralized to not be a security.

49:18.900 --> 49:24.780
So I'm skeptical of most token offerings not being securities.

49:24.780 --> 49:28.980
Now, NFT sales, this is new.

49:28.980 --> 49:30.060
This is very interesting,

49:30.060 --> 49:36.380
and I suspect there is a little bit more fertile ground here to do it correctly while

49:36.380 --> 49:43.980
also, plenty of pitfalls to do it incorrectly.

49:43.980 --> 49:48.260
People can sell NFTs, which is underlying there's a form of token.

49:48.260 --> 49:50.340
And do all types of things.

49:50.340 --> 49:51.900
It could be a piece of work;

49:51.900 --> 49:52.900
I'm an NFT photographer,
49:52.900 --> 49:54.860
I sold a piece of work.

49:54.860 --> 49:59.500
It could be a PFP, then a PFP process.

49:59.500 --> 50:04.700
It could be a token that gives you some type of utility in a game or application,

50:04.700 --> 50:07.940
there are many reasons.

50:07.940 --> 50:15.580
Generally, if it's this type of thing like I just described, but they are buying something

50:15.580 --> 50:19.540
and that thing that they're buying is an object,

50:19.540 --> 50:24.860
but if it was sold pre tokens, I went to the gallery,

50:24.860 --> 50:30.540
I bought a painting.

50:30.540 --> 50:35.220
I went to the real estate agent, I bought a piece of land.

50:35.220 --> 50:41.100
These things are not securities.

50:41.100 --> 50:43.620
These things are perfectly fine as financing methods.

50:43.620 --> 50:49.900
These things are income or revenue to the person selling them to you,

50:49.900 --> 50:54.260
and they're not a financial instrument, right?

50:54.260 --> 50:57.220
Where people get in trouble though, and how I think people are going to get in trouble

50:57.220 --> 50:59.220
with NFts is,

50:59.220 --> 51:06.340
they say, oh, yeah, you buy this cool NFT,

51:06.340 --> 51:17.460
and it's in the, it will have a share of the project DAO and the project DAO is going

51:17.460 --> 51:27.540
to get 50% of the royalties from all the trades that happen later with the NFTs

51:27.540 --> 51:33.980
and also 10% of the primary sales of future NFTs so that DAO is going to be valuable and

51:33.980 --> 51:35.780
you'll have a share of the Dow,

51:35.780 --> 51:36.780
well, congratulations,

51:36.780 --> 51:40.660
you've made a security.

51:40.660 --> 51:45.060
The real life equivalent would be you go to a gallery and you say, and the gallery is

51:45.060 --> 51:46.900
like, oh, I'm going to sell you this painting,

51:46.900 --> 51:52.020
and when you buy this painting and have a really beautiful painting, it's by G. Taring.

51:52.020 --> 51:57.340
and also, I am going to give you one 10,000th of the profit of my gallery for the rest of

51:57.340 --> 52:00.620
eternity.

52:00.620 --> 52:05.700
That part that I'm going to give you one 10,000th of my profit of my gallery for the rest of

52:05.700 --> 52:17.940
eternity, that part turns that key card in painting into security.

52:17.940 --> 52:21.100
We don't have case law in this area yet.

52:21.100 --> 52:27.460
There hasn't been enforcement in this area yet.

52:27.460 --> 52:32.740
I do think that though, both of these statements are going to be true.

52:32.740 --> 52:40.620
I think there's a lot of opportunities to have effectively community based funding that

52:40.620 --> 52:50.020
is not a security in a way that is hard to do with fungible tokens because you can solve

52:50.020 --> 52:54.060
something that has value in and of itself, whereas a fungible token,

52:54.060 --> 52:57.660
it's very hard to have value in and of itself.

52:57.660 --> 53:07.460
If XCOPY, they did an example, wants to do all types of projects in the NFT field,

53:07.460 --> 53:19.860
and XCOPY sells a piece of one of one art for 100 ETH or 666 thrusters for however

53:19.860 --> 53:27.260
specific result or an open edition for one ETH.

53:27.260 --> 53:28.260
This is fine.

53:28.260 --> 53:34.180
None of these things are securities.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.380
XCOPY will have earned a lot of money.

53:36.380 --> 53:46.780
It will have been given to XCOPY by people who broadly believe in the XCOPY brand, universe,

53:46.780 --> 53:47.780
etc.

53:47.780 --> 53:52.980
They might even be expecting a profit, but they're not going to call an enterprise with XCOPY.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.260
They own an XCOPY painting.

53:55.260 --> 54:00.340
XCOPY is off to go do something else, they're not going to call an enterprise together.

54:00.340 --> 54:07.340
So, I believe this ability to reach out to your community, customers, fans, whatever you

54:07.340 --> 54:13.340
want to call them, and sell them tokens directly that are, in this case, non-fungible, is a

54:13.340 --> 54:17.940
viable fundraising method here.

54:17.940 --> 54:21.860
I also believe quite a few people are going to screw it up.

54:21.860 --> 54:29.100
They are going to accidentally create securities or in some cases on purpose, but I think in

54:29.100 --> 54:39.820
most cases, accidentally, and they will have some enforcement in a couple years against some

54:39.820 --> 54:42.020
of these accidental ones.

54:42.020 --> 54:46.900
They're not going to be able to chase around all of them because there's a lot of them,

54:46.900 --> 54:49.460
but they don't generally need to chase around a lot of them,

54:49.460 --> 54:52.260
they just go after a handful of them.

54:52.260 --> 54:57.700
And what happened last year was, they went after a handful of them and then everyone got worried and

54:57.700 --> 55:04.100
there was less, there was less, fewer ICOs after them.

55:04.100 --> 55:12.660
And so, to me, this is the most interesting and new area in the financing space.

55:12.660 --> 55:18.380
Is there a way to use NFTs or, what are the ways to use NFTs in a compliant manner?

55:18.380 --> 55:21.580
They went, I don't believe in all these things.

55:21.580 --> 55:25.220
I get it, I get it, and the rules should change.

55:25.220 --> 55:31.020
Yeah, I actually think the Howey Test needs to be updated or the Acreditor Investor rules

55:31.020 --> 55:36.860
need to be updated to account for the types of Web3 projects we're seeing.

55:36.860 --> 55:43.340
I do not believe that if you're spending points to ETH and you get part of the royalties

55:43.340 --> 55:49.500
of an NFT DAO, you actually need to have a million dollars in net worth to be able to do it.

55:49.500 --> 55:54.020
But that's going to involve changing the regulations of the United States and I don't

55:54.020 --> 55:56.220
think it's going to happen imminently.

55:56.220 --> 55:58.820
It maybe will happen in a few years, but it's not the case today.

55:58.820 --> 56:08.660
As I want to say, well, I live in, making some, I live in Kenya, these things don't

56:08.660 --> 56:09.660
apply in Kenya.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.820
Okay, they might not.

56:11.820 --> 56:16.340
The SEC rules obviously do not apply to you in Kenya.

56:16.340 --> 56:20.820
I don't know what rules do apply in Kenya though, so you should check.

56:20.820 --> 56:26.140
And then you probably have to be a little bit careful if you have US participants that

56:26.140 --> 56:28.500
are practically, you have an enforcement risk.

56:28.500 --> 56:32.860
Probably if you have a small project in Kenya, that would have been a security under US securities law,

56:32.860 --> 56:35.980
but under Kenya, it's a 50 ETH project.

56:35.980 --> 56:38.060
No, it's probably practically going to bother you.

56:38.060 --> 56:40.020
This is not legal advice.

56:40.020 --> 56:46.660
But if it becomes large and huge and successful, I don't know, you never know, the US regulatory

56:46.660 --> 56:49.460
authorities can be quite globally ambitious at times.

56:49.460 --> 56:56.420
So, you still need to be careful, my suggestion.

56:56.420 --> 57:00.660
And I think there are interesting things to explore that are not securities.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.580
So I am going to wrap up here.

57:02.580 --> 57:06.500
It's been about an hour, so I can take some questions.

57:06.500 --> 57:11.500
So let's take it again from the beginning.

57:11.500 --> 57:17.300
Step one, is it a security or not?

57:17.300 --> 57:22.980
If it is not, right, you can sell it to anyone.

57:22.980 --> 57:28.620
If it is, you either need to do an IPO, which practically speaking, you're not going to

57:28.620 --> 57:34.780
do, or you need to sell it only to Accredited Investors, or, you need to take advantage of

57:34.780 --> 57:42.500
the Reg A exemption for crowdfunding, which is also not totally none, not totally trivial.

57:42.500 --> 57:52.740
And so what that means in practice is because of these limitations imposed by the United

57:52.740 --> 58:05.780
States, even in this highly decentralized world, most things are funded by VCs.

58:05.780 --> 58:10.220
It remains difficult, I believe, to do a compliant, fungible token offering.

58:10.220 --> 58:17.900
It is very possible to do a non-compliant NFT offering.

58:17.900 --> 58:27.060
But there might be interesting ways to start building communities with NFTs that are not

58:27.060 --> 58:40.060
securities, and that do lead to a more decentralized model of financing than, than...

58:40.060 --> 58:48.060
what we have seen without non-fungible tokens.

58:48.060 --> 58:59.140
So, let's go to questions, and hopefully I have not absolutely bored everyone to death.

58:59.140 --> 59:08.060
This is, I think, the least artsy session we're going to do, but I do think it is important.

59:08.060 --> 59:32.620
I need to open Discord so I can get fed the questions. 

59:32.620 --> 59:39.420
(63 seconds pause)

59:39.420 --> 59:50.620

00:20.620 --> 00:23.620
The first three questions are about Nouns.

00:26.620 --> 00:31.620
We're starting off with the hard questions.

00:32.620 --> 00:36.620
Let me read all three questions and I'll try and answer them together.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.620
Can you speak about the Nouns DAO model?

00:39.620 --> 00:44.620
It seems like the most sensible and successful type of DAO model I've seen

00:44.620 --> 00:49.620
and seems to circumvent the securities issues put forth.

00:50.620 --> 00:54.620
Would you consider Nouns an autonomous smart contract

00:54.620 --> 00:57.620
or a group of people working together?

00:57.620 --> 01:01.620
Are Nouns SEC compliant in your point of view?

01:02.620 --> 01:06.620
Well, the Noun smart contract is for sure a smart contract,

01:06.620 --> 01:09.620
it's for sure an autonomous smart contract.

01:09.620 --> 01:14.620
Creating a Noun every day until eternity.

01:15.620 --> 01:24.620
That part is fairly DAO-like from the way that I think of DAOs, the old fashioned way.

01:32.620 --> 01:37.620
The way the treasury is allocated is not autonomous, right?

01:37.620 --> 01:49.620
There are DAO proposals and people who are holders of DAOs, vote on the proposals

01:49.620 --> 01:56.620
and they vote to send it out to space or to buy skateboards for kids or what have you,

01:56.620 --> 01:59.620
generally lovely things that they vote for.

01:59.620 --> 02:08.620
But they're not autonomous. An autonomous thing would not have humans in the decision making, right?

02:09.620 --> 02:14.620
How Bitcoin allocates block rewards is autonomous.

02:15.620 --> 02:24.620
You know it's an autonomous because you don't have to get a bunch of people every ten minutes

02:24.620 --> 02:29.620
to vote if this person needs to get a block reward or if this other person who's got a block reward,

02:29.620 --> 02:33.620
if they've made a nice proposal, or, so on.

02:39.620 --> 02:47.620
Are Nouns or some parts of Nouns SEC compliant? I can't answer that question,

02:47.620 --> 02:56.620
and I'm not going to answer that question for more or less anything because I'm not qualified to answer that question.

02:56.620 --> 03:01.620
I'm not an attorney, I'm not a securities attorney.

03:01.620 --> 03:10.620
I would feel comfortable, I guess, saying, you know, if XCOPY mints a one-of-one piece of art

03:10.620 --> 03:18.620
and that piece of art is just that piece of art, that's not a security. I'm pretty comfortable saying that.

03:18.620 --> 03:25.620
But what I don't want to get into, and if you notice, I'll never say this on Twitter either,

03:25.620 --> 03:33.620
is starting to get into the more ambitious projects and certainly projects that put the word DAO in their names

03:33.620 --> 03:41.620
and then having to fine-tune the differences between one or another or the third or the fourth or the fifth,

03:41.620 --> 03:44.620
but what about this one or what about the other one?

03:47.620 --> 03:56.620
It's not my position to come out and say, oh, no, 6529 said this, whatever project is not about nouns, right?

03:56.620 --> 04:07.620
So, out of giving the exact same answer, whatever people had asked this question of.

04:07.620 --> 04:17.620
And so, even my non-answer, don't take it as an answer, don't take it as like, oh, 6529 didn't say that this wasn't a security,

04:17.620 --> 04:21.620
it means you think it is a security. That's not what I'm saying either.

04:21.620 --> 04:27.620
I am saying I've thought about this topic very, very carefully and I've thought about it before this class,

04:27.620 --> 04:33.620
I've thought about it for the last year and a half on my Twitter feed and you will never find a Tweet that says,

04:33.620 --> 04:38.620
I think this project is a security or I think this project is not a security.

04:38.620 --> 04:49.620
Because, if I get into being the securities regulator, well, that's not my job

04:49.620 --> 04:53.620
and I don't have all the information, I don't even have all the knowledge.

04:53.620 --> 05:00.620
And so, I don't want to make wrong decisions in either direction as a matter of policy.

05:00.620 --> 05:07.620
I don't want people like, oh, I don't think it's a security that it turns out it is and someone says, well, gosh, 6529 told us it was a security

05:07.620 --> 05:10.620
and then I bought it because I didn't think it was regulatory risk.

05:10.620 --> 05:18.620
And now, Gary Gensler thinks that whatever DAO is a security, 6529 has led me astray.

05:18.620 --> 05:20.620
I do not want to lead you astray.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.620
And I certainly don't want to do the opposite either.

05:22.620 --> 05:29.620
Like, if something turns out that it's not a security and I'm worried a little bit, but maybe I'm too conservative,

05:29.620 --> 05:32.620
I certainly don't want to say something inappropriate on a project.

05:32.620 --> 05:37.620
So, I'm just not going to answer that question for any project as a matter of policy.

05:37.620 --> 05:40.620
I've already seen something come in for prison and company.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.620
I'm not going to answer for that either.

05:42.620 --> 05:51.620
But part I do feel comfortable answering about the Nouns DAO, which is not part of the Howey Test.

05:51.620 --> 05:58.620
Right, per se, the Nouns DAO in aggregate is not 100% autonomous.

05:58.620 --> 06:03.620
So, the Nouns do vote on how to spend their pressure.

06:03.620 --> 06:05.620
So, that part requires humans.

06:05.620 --> 06:07.620
That doesn't mean it's a security,

06:07.620 --> 06:08.620
doesn't mean it's not a security.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.620
It just says it's a smart contract is taught.

06:11.620 --> 06:19.620
And I think that is fairly close to a DAO the way I used to think about.

06:19.620 --> 06:21.620
All right, next question.

06:21.620 --> 06:29.620
Will the way the US handles NFT projects legally be followed by the rest of the world or can other countries do their own things?

06:29.620 --> 06:32.620
I think it's going to be a mix.

06:32.620 --> 06:40.620
I think the general US policy on securities tends to be more restrictive than most of the rest of the world.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.620
I think that's going to continue.

06:42.620 --> 07:00.620
I think most of the rest of the world is more principles, no,

07:00.620 --> 07:11.620
less principles based and only principles and like good principles or bad principles.

07:11.620 --> 07:17.620
I think it is more prescriptive on what's a security and what's not a security,

07:17.620 --> 07:19.620
and I suspect that's not going to change.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.620
Whereas the US approach tends to be more principles based.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.620
I think that's not going to change either.

07:24.620 --> 07:34.620
So I don't think there's going to be some kind of end-to-end global convergence on this topic.

07:34.620 --> 07:38.620
What is your take on Gary Gensler refusing to allow spot BTC EFTs,

07:38.620 --> 07:51.620
and just stalling any project. Wall Street protection delaying cryptos for CBDC adoption, can't seem to see any logical reason?

07:51.620 --> 07:54.620
I don't know, I mean, Gary likes BTC.

07:54.620 --> 08:01.620
So Gary might not like, Gary as far as I can tell, is something close to Bitcoin Maxion.

08:01.620 --> 08:09.620
So I don't think the reason is Gary doesn't like BTC, because if there's one crypto that he does like,

08:09.620 --> 08:15.620
it is in fact BTC.

08:15.620 --> 08:36.620
What I think the SEC's official position is, is something along the lines of, it's still not comfortable with the way the BTC spot markets are working.

08:36.620 --> 08:40.620
They might be wrong.

08:40.620 --> 08:58.620
They might be right. They might be wrong, but in a way that it is because of their own intellectual biases or maybe they see some things we don't.

08:58.620 --> 09:12.620
I mean, the crypto market participants, institutional participants have not exactly covered themselves in glory,

09:12.620 --> 09:14.620
this cycle.

09:14.620 --> 09:35.620
So, I don't know. I don't want to judge. My guess is, my guess is that they should approve one and they're not.

09:35.620 --> 09:47.620
But I wouldn't like, put my hand 100% in the fire that I'm 100% certain that they're wrong.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.620
I think they're wrong but I'm not sure they're wrong.

09:49.620 --> 10:00.620
So there might be, there might be information that we don't have,

10:00.620 --> 10:06.620
answers to.

10:06.620 --> 10:09.620
But we don't, sorry, we don't have visibility into.

10:09.620 --> 10:12.620
But they do. I don't know.

10:12.620 --> 10:22.620
Okay. How do you avoid. Can you avoid security status if the "work" is being done by the person receiving the income instead of by the "work" of others?

10:22.620 --> 10:27.620
I'm a little concerned because the question came with quotes around the word work.

10:27.620 --> 10:36.620
So I'm assuming it just I'm reading without quotes or not saying like, oh, fake work or pretending that the work is being done by others.

10:36.620 --> 10:50.620
Look, if the person receiving the income is doing the work to receive the income without knowing the specific idea being shared here,

10:50.620 --> 10:54.620
that's generally not a security, that's generally income.

10:54.620 --> 10:59.620
Right. If I say I'm going to...

10:59.620 --> 11:06.620
Don't make Martinis for people and sell them and people are going to pay me money for making the Martinis. That's fine.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.620
That's not a security.

11:09.620 --> 11:20.620
And the SEC is not concerned that there's information asymmetry between me, the Martini maker and me, the person collecting money for making Martinis.

11:20.620 --> 11:26.620
Because presumably I know what I'm... I know all the information about what I'm doing.

11:26.620 --> 11:29.620
So,

11:29.620 --> 11:34.620
but it's hard for me to exactly imagine what

11:34.620 --> 11:40.620
that is.

11:40.620 --> 11:52.620
So...

11:52.620 --> 11:58.620
Okay. Next question. Without being financial advice, but perhaps being cultural advice.

11:58.620 --> 12:05.620
Are there any funding models that seem particularly appealing or interesting to you on Web3 currently

12:05.620 --> 12:13.620
besides being an artist minting work who has managed to find a collector audience aside?

12:13.620 --> 12:16.620
Okay. This one's tricky. I'm going to...

12:16.620 --> 12:20.620
I don't know for sure.

12:20.620 --> 12:25.620
I've been thinking about this.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.620
So I'll try and share some ideas.

12:28.620 --> 12:32.620
I don't think they're great, to be honest.

12:32.620 --> 12:38.620
If I had like fully fleshed out great ideas, I'd already be doing them.

12:38.620 --> 12:43.620
So for sure, artists selling art,

12:43.620 --> 12:45.620
is great.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.620
It works.

12:47.620 --> 12:52.620
For artists who have found their audience or an audience

12:52.620 --> 12:55.620
I think it's transformational.

12:55.620 --> 13:05.620
They should pay whatever taxes are due in wherever they live so they dont get in trouble for that.

13:05.620 --> 13:09.620
But other than that, its just the team, it's a whole new exciting world for that. So I think... I know you said not that model, but I am reiterating, it's a great model.

13:09.620 --> 13:12.620
I think a second model of which,

13:12.620 --> 13:16.620
probably the best example is Gary V.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.620
Or it's easy to see Gary V, I'm not sure it's the best example, what should be done but

13:18.620 --> 13:27.620
I think there's clearly an opportunity for personalities to monetize their own personality.

13:27.620 --> 13:32.620
I mean, the V friends.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.620
Or bought primarily.

13:35.620 --> 13:41.620
I think without in any way wanting to cast dispersions on the artwork.

13:41.620 --> 13:48.620
I think people bought them as a bet on Gary V as an affinity with Gary V.

13:48.620 --> 13:56.620
Gary V has been very active on social media since the beginning.

13:56.620 --> 14:03.620
And I think if someone who was, I wouldn't say that Gary V and I hope he doesn't take his own way.

14:03.620 --> 14:06.620
Isn't any danger of being a museum great artist, right?

14:06.620 --> 14:11.620
I don't think people bought the Gary V art with the hope that

14:11.620 --> 14:14.620
someday the moment might want this.

14:14.620 --> 14:21.620
What I think they did was, I feel a bet on Gary V.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.620
I feel an affinity with Gary V.

14:23.620 --> 14:28.620
I want to be part of something Gary V.

14:28.620 --> 14:39.620
So the ability to fund and capture a personality is probably something that's interesting here

14:39.620 --> 14:43.620
that didn't exactly exist.

14:43.620 --> 14:46.620
The work I did was like, okay, well, that's kind of like an artist running an audience.

14:46.620 --> 14:54.620
What I'm really asking 6529 is how do you do something for someone who's not already rich and famous?

14:54.620 --> 15:02.620
Right? Okay, this is a hard question.

15:02.620 --> 15:12.620
Now, first answer might not be what people are looking for, but it's probably okay.

15:12.620 --> 15:17.620
Tokens directed to charitable causes are fine.

15:17.620 --> 15:25.620
So it doesn't match the expectation of profit.

15:25.620 --> 15:30.620
So let's say you set up a nonprofit and your nonprofit goal

15:30.620 --> 15:42.620
is to be cliche and lazy on this was to save the Amazonian rainforest and the way we're going to save it is by buying land and for any NFT you buy,

15:42.620 --> 16:00.620
you get an NFT representing that acre of land, but someone has properly set up a 501(c)(3)nonprofit organization in the United States

16:00.620 --> 16:11.620
and when they issue the NFT and let's say the NFT is, I don't know, 0.1 ETH and you buy this one acre in the jungle and the nonprofit gets the money

16:11.620 --> 16:20.620
they buy the acre, the title of the acre is with the nonprofit, not with the NFT holder.

16:20.620 --> 16:23.620
Again, without being legal advice, etc. etc. all will be okay.

16:23.620 --> 16:31.620
And my sense is, a better user experience.

16:31.620 --> 16:34.620
Than send money to someone,

16:34.620 --> 16:36.620
a charity in this case,

16:36.620 --> 16:41.620
and get an email receipt.

16:41.620 --> 16:47.620
I think once this stuff gets worked out,

16:47.620 --> 16:53.620
I believe it's going to be a more effective fundraising model for charity than what happens now.

16:53.620 --> 16:58.620
I'm just thinking of myself because it like it gave me fries and it makes it a little bit more fun.

16:58.620 --> 17:10.620
If I just sent $1,000 to the Amazonian rainforest charity and got some receipt that said thank you for your contribution

17:10.620 --> 17:12.620
you can use this to deduct it under taxes.

17:12.620 --> 17:19.620
I'm not going to be trying to boring with the funds over the second. I've done my good deed. Let's say, but the funds over the second.

17:19.620 --> 17:22.620
I've sent it and gotten my receipt.

17:22.620 --> 17:34.620
If instead there's a grid of whatever 10,000 acres and each acres and NFT and the NFT actually reflected the grid use a satellite photo or whatever

17:34.620 --> 17:38.620
don't pick out the acres you're trying to save.

17:38.620 --> 17:42.620
And then at the end you have like 10 NFTs instead of an email receipt.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.620
They might also send you an email receipt.

17:44.620 --> 17:47.620
They're like, you have 10 NFTs and I can show them in my wallet.

17:47.620 --> 17:58.620
And I'm like, look, I saved these 10 acres and maybe you'll say, gosh, you're getting ego benefits out of it.

17:58.620 --> 18:02.620
I'm going to say, okay, so what if I get an ego benefits out of it, we save the acres and they're a good thing.

18:02.620 --> 18:06.620
Or maybe I'll say, no, it's not for my ego by me highlighting this in my wallet.

18:06.620 --> 18:16.620
A lot of people look at my wallet. I'm going to help other people learn about this and maybe they'll save more acres.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.620
Yeah, that sounds interesting.

18:19.620 --> 18:24.620
Next bucket.

18:24.620 --> 18:33.620
I would like to see, you're going to say, why don't you do one and the answer is going to be I haven't thought of one yet.

18:33.620 --> 18:41.620
I would like to see some things that are pure down like my OG Definition.

18:41.620 --> 18:48.620
A smart contract that does something with NFTs.

18:48.620 --> 19:03.620
It doesn't, once it's been deployed, it does it automatically forever without human interaction.

19:03.620 --> 19:09.620
That's probably, okay.

19:09.620 --> 19:13.620
What that is, I don't know.

19:13.620 --> 19:20.620
I haven't figured it out. And it's not like it's an it. There are many possible it's there.

19:20.620 --> 19:32.620
But as a general principle, the idea that there'll be some smart contract on Ethereum every minute or hour or day or week.

19:32.620 --> 19:47.620
I've been thinking NFT or selling it and if you're buying it and without the part that there's like a bunch of people in a discord trying to decide something or another.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.620
I like that idea.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.620
I don't know what that idea would be, what it would do.

19:53.620 --> 19:56.620
But I like that idea.

19:56.620 --> 20:08.620
If you're investing in any NFT projects that may be subject to legal issues, do holders have to feel about fear of backlash?

20:08.620 --> 20:10.620
I'll end with this question.

20:10.620 --> 20:17.620
And I think the holders need to think about this in two buckets.

20:17.620 --> 20:33.620
The first bucket is the following.

20:33.620 --> 20:39.620
Will the price of the NFTs in that project, but I'm probably.

20:39.620 --> 20:50.620
If someone comes to a project and says, Oh, we've received or being sued by the SEC because our

20:50.620 --> 20:56.620
NFTs that give rights to their profits of the DAO might be secure. Well, no one's going to like that. Right? So the price is going to go down.

20:56.620 --> 21:01.620
People are going to sell.

21:01.620 --> 21:04.620
Second, maybe they'll be forced to change what they do.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.620
So maybe they'll be less appealing.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.620
Now, will you a holder have a new legal risk?

21:09.620 --> 21:10.620
Probably not.

21:10.620 --> 21:12.620
This is not legal advice.

21:12.620 --> 21:18.620
There was a very strange and interesting case where there was this DAO that was pretending to be autonomus but really wasn't,

21:18.620 --> 21:24.620
and the CFTC kind of said, Oh, I might go after people who voted because they were like part of the team.

21:24.620 --> 21:28.620
Now, I practiced the only one after the project promoters.

21:28.620 --> 21:33.620
There was a dissenting opinion in the CFTC that says, you know, basically this is nuts like.

21:33.620 --> 21:39.620
Since when would people in DAO have to think about this topic?

21:39.620 --> 21:42.620
Um.

21:42.620 --> 21:44.620
And okay.

21:44.620 --> 21:50.620
Um, do I believe this is a major risk? No, I do not.

21:50.620 --> 22:02.620
Do I believe it is zero risk in all scenarios? Like, no, I mean, it's conceivable. Let's say you were not the project promoter.

22:02.620 --> 22:10.620
But you were buyer number one and you bought a bunch of the NFTs and you went out and started promoting it yourself and voting and doing things.

22:10.620 --> 22:16.620
Could you imagine some relatively extreme, but not completely irrational cases?

22:16.620 --> 22:20.620
Well, as you see in the CFTC, you were part of this. You were doing this.

22:20.620 --> 22:26.620
You were kind of like the person selling the unregistered securities you weren't just a buyer of them.

22:26.620 --> 22:29.620
Yeah, conceivably, I can see in certain.

22:29.620 --> 22:42.620
I haven't seen too many things in the NFT space that would have triggered my concern on this topic, but I could imagine it happen.

22:42.620 --> 22:44.620
So.

22:44.620 --> 23:01.620
I will end here. Thank you as always everyone for joining, and see you back on Twitter.

23:14.620 --> 23:19.620
Thank you.
