00:00.000 --> 00:25.480
Okay, everyone, I think we are now all set.

00:25.480 --> 00:33.720
This is session 6 of META-511 Non-Fungible Tokens and the Metaverse.

00:33.720 --> 00:37.160
And today, the session sounds a little bit more general.

00:37.160 --> 00:40.000
It's called Key Considerations in the NFT space.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.040
And I'll get into what that means in a little bit.

00:44.040 --> 00:54.800
Before I do that, I'd like to acknowledge that the last 24, 48, 72 hours in the general

00:54.800 --> 00:58.240
crypto space, I think, has been quite dramatic.

00:58.240 --> 01:06.160
I assume almost everyone here knows, but in case we have non-crypto folks here who don't

01:06.160 --> 01:12.000
over the last couple of days, FTX, which is one of the largest exchanges in the world,

01:12.000 --> 01:18.680
and has failed to meet redemptions withdraws.

01:18.680 --> 01:23.080
And this is causing understandably a lot of turbulence in the market, a lot of anxiety

01:23.080 --> 01:25.520
of what it might mean.

01:25.520 --> 01:33.880
And it looks like there's no immediate end in sight to this situation.

01:33.880 --> 01:41.080
What I wanted to just say for a second, what I wanted to share with you what I've said

01:41.080 --> 01:47.360
on my Twitter feed, first of all, I'm sure some people, a lot of people, maybe some people

01:47.360 --> 01:50.920
here, have been hurt by this.

01:50.920 --> 01:55.400
And I feel very badly for anyone who has been hurt by this.

01:55.400 --> 02:01.960
You should be able to trust that an exchange that has your tokens or your money can give

02:01.960 --> 02:05.520
them back to you when you want to.

02:05.520 --> 02:09.320
But sadly, that often in crypto has not happened.

02:09.320 --> 02:16.680
Unfortunately, the natural keys, not your coins, stay of crypto has often been this way.

02:16.680 --> 02:27.960
But what I wanted to share is it might feel very bleak.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.520
And this has happened many times before in crypto.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.640
And as many times as anyone who's been in the field for a very long time has been through

02:33.640 --> 02:38.400
multiple of these cycles and has been hit at various points through these cycles.

02:38.400 --> 02:51.040
So if you're just regular, sad, and don't talk to your non-crypto friends, it will pass.

02:51.040 --> 02:54.400
If you're seriously sad, please do seek help.

02:54.400 --> 03:00.000
This is, crypto is important, money is important, of course, all these things are important.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.920
But they're not as important as your health as you're well-being, your family, and

03:03.920 --> 03:08.880
a lot of people are really in shock today.

03:08.880 --> 03:13.880
And for a lot of people, this might be the first time that this has happened to them.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.640
And so do take care of yourself.

03:17.640 --> 03:26.800
In the end, you look back at these things over time and they feel very different than

03:26.800 --> 03:30.040
a point of when they do while they're happening.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.760
I have had things like this happen to me multiple times over the last decade.

03:34.760 --> 03:41.600
And when you're in it, it is extraordinarily stressful, painful, maybe emotionally painful.

03:41.600 --> 03:46.640
And over time, then it feels very different.

03:46.640 --> 03:54.360
And there, in the fullness of times, I mean, it's just become really interesting stories,

03:54.360 --> 03:59.880
which sounds crazy at the moment to think about it, the moment you're just saying, my

03:59.880 --> 04:00.880
own disaster.

04:00.880 --> 04:07.400
But I'm here to say that it's not like that.

04:07.400 --> 04:10.560
The vast majority of cases, it's not like that.

04:10.560 --> 04:18.800
And just like when everything is going super super well, it's never as good as it seems.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.840
When things are going badly as they are now, it's never as bad as it seems.

04:24.840 --> 04:33.880
And so do take care of yourself, don't let yourself take it too hard.

04:33.880 --> 04:38.800
Whatever has happened in this case has probably more or less happened and is probably out

04:38.800 --> 04:42.760
of your control in the case of FTX.

04:42.760 --> 04:49.840
And so do me, do me, be kind to yourself, be kind to yourself, be kind to your family.

04:49.840 --> 05:01.620
And as I said, it's never as good as it seemspol as it seems Brund Time is probably a good

05:01.620 --> 05:16.700
life- Executioners are something that we9 arcade time for and letters are a good model for

05:16.700 --> 05:17.700
you.

05:17.700 --> 05:22.660
seems perfect, there's some reversion to the meme in your happiness and in your life,

05:22.660 --> 05:27.660
and when everything seems terrible, the same is actually true.

05:27.660 --> 05:34.620
So I didn't want to share that, so I shared it on Twitter.

05:34.620 --> 05:40.620
It is some of us are hardened now.

05:40.620 --> 05:43.620
We've been through this many times.

05:43.620 --> 05:50.620
So to the degree that is helpful for people who are going through it for the first time,

05:50.620 --> 05:58.620
now would like to be helpful and find a friend, talk to a friend, talk to a fellow,

05:58.620 --> 06:03.620
get off Crypto Twitter, that's possibly a good idea.

06:03.620 --> 06:08.620
Be kind to yourself.

06:08.620 --> 06:16.620
Okay, now today's session is another framework session.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.620
What do I mean?

06:17.620 --> 06:25.620
These are topics that we are going to dive into in-depth with a lot of the guests.

06:25.620 --> 06:35.620
We are going to bring guests without who are specialists in these topics.

06:35.620 --> 06:44.620
And maybe on something that today is a slide, we'll spend a whole hour.

06:44.620 --> 06:49.620
So just like we did in a couple of the more recent sessions,

06:49.620 --> 06:55.620
and particularly for folks who are newer to this field,

06:55.620 --> 07:00.620
I want to make sure we have the same basic frameworks among all of us.

07:00.620 --> 07:15.620
And then, and then we will go into the individual sessions and dig into this in much more detail.

07:15.620 --> 07:28.620
So my guess is as many of the prior sessions, this is going to be more fairly basic for the advanced folks today.

07:28.620 --> 07:35.620
And we'll get into the advanced topics in sessions, but for folks who may be not as deep into the space,

07:35.620 --> 07:36.620
it'll be helpful.

07:36.620 --> 07:39.620
It's a level setting.

07:39.620 --> 07:42.620
It's a level-setting session.

07:42.620 --> 07:47.620
So, let me, that's the same.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.620
I want to talk about pre-topics today.

07:49.620 --> 07:55.620
This topic of collectibles, this question of aesthetics and versus rarity,

07:55.620 --> 08:04.620
which is often discussed in the space, a little bit of NFT-5, which is a play on the word DeFi,

08:04.620 --> 08:13.620
or DeFi being decentralized finance, and a variety of crypto services that are effectively financial services,

08:13.620 --> 08:19.620
but they're running as on-chain protocols, not as centralized companies.

08:19.620 --> 08:28.620
So, Uniswap is a DeFi exchange, compound is a DeFi lender, a small editorial note.

08:28.620 --> 08:38.620
A nice thing about DeFi services is you can see, transparently, what's happening all the way through,

08:38.620 --> 08:44.620
which apparently has not been the case for the centralized crypto services,

08:44.620 --> 08:50.620
which have truly performed very poorly during this fair market.

08:50.620 --> 09:00.620
So, the theory that the value and the interesting thing and the magic of crypto assets and crypto currencies

09:00.620 --> 09:07.620
of blockchain is the on-chain part, not a centralized company wrapped around your on-chain balances,

09:07.620 --> 09:15.620
un-beated, undefeated. This is what it's all about for better or for worse.

09:15.620 --> 09:22.620
So, we'll talk a little bit about how NFTs may or may not interact with DeFi.

09:22.620 --> 09:26.620
So, let's talk about collectibles.

09:26.620 --> 09:36.620
And collectibles is one of these concepts that is thrown around a lot in the space.

09:36.620 --> 09:48.620
Mostly as a criticism, mostly its people saying, you mostly hear this concept from people from outside the space

09:48.620 --> 09:59.620
saying, well, this stuff's not really art. It's collectibles.

09:59.620 --> 10:09.620
And they mean that primarily in a negative way. Sometimes in a neutral, it's really meant in a positive way.

10:09.620 --> 10:18.620
And it's interesting to think, is that true? Is that accurate? Or is it accurate?

10:18.620 --> 10:22.620
And I thought it was something like, okay, what are collectibles?

10:22.620 --> 10:30.620
One of the things that are unambiguously collectibles that nobody really questions that they are collectibles.

10:30.620 --> 10:37.620
How many, many things? Humans love to collect things.

10:37.620 --> 10:43.620
Different humans love to collect different types of things.

10:43.620 --> 10:53.620
But it does seem to be some type of innate human desire. What are like things that are real people collect?

10:53.620 --> 11:00.620
Well, those are stamps. I'm a stamp collector. I'm a coin collector.

11:00.620 --> 11:07.620
I'm a baseball card collector. I'm a football card collector. I'm a comic book collector.

11:07.620 --> 11:14.620
I'm a Beanie baby collector. It's always an example. Everyone always mentions beanie because it all comes to this.

11:14.620 --> 11:20.620
I'm a collectible wine collector.

11:20.620 --> 11:25.620
And wine's interesting because there's two categories of wine, right? There's collectible grade wine.

11:25.620 --> 11:31.620
I mean, not collectible grade wine. There's the kind of cheap and cheerful wine that you buy from the supermarket

11:31.620 --> 11:34.620
and you'll have tonight for dinner.

11:34.620 --> 11:38.620
That wine, even if you collect, it's not going to make any difference like it's not.

11:38.620 --> 11:45.620
It's not actually collectible wine. And then there's wine that is, that ages well and is limited supply and is high quality.

11:45.620 --> 11:52.620
It is collectible. Classic cars are collectible.

11:52.620 --> 11:57.620
Comic books are collectible.

11:57.620 --> 12:05.620
But also things from the fashion world. Certain handbags are collectibles.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.620
Certain watches are collectibles.

12:09.620 --> 12:17.620
Genstones, jewelry. All of these are broadly in the category of collectibles.

12:17.620 --> 12:28.620
And many of these things, many of them, have long-term established value.

12:28.620 --> 12:42.620
So, stamps have been something that people collected a decade ago and 50 years ago and 100 years ago.

12:42.620 --> 12:48.620
It's not going likely to change.

12:48.620 --> 12:57.620
Genstones have been collected for millennia.

12:57.620 --> 13:19.620
And in categories of collectibles, where it has become established that the categories important and people care about it,

13:19.620 --> 13:28.620
they tend to trade on rarity. Stamps are a great example. They are.

13:28.620 --> 13:41.620
A very large number of stamps involved. Some of them are very pretty. Some of them are beautiful.

13:41.620 --> 13:50.620
But a typical run of stamps is gigantic.

13:50.620 --> 13:55.620
There might be millions. The United States, they have the stamps. It's the American flag.

13:55.620 --> 14:03.620
I don't think it's even millions. It might be hundreds of millions that have been printed of that stamp.

14:03.620 --> 14:12.620
That might be an aesthetically appealing stamp. It might be more aesthetically appealing than a rare stamp, but it does not generate collectible value.

14:12.620 --> 14:17.620
Because the supply is very large.

14:17.620 --> 14:24.620
And so, even if 100,000, 100,000 people say, oh, yeah, what one of those things?

14:24.620 --> 14:40.620
There's so much supply that when the basic laws of supply and demand kick in, the laws of supply and demand being the price of something is how much demand there is for it, how many people want it.

14:40.620 --> 14:46.620
And also how much of it there is.

14:46.620 --> 14:56.620
So, you know, people who haven't taken a microeconomic class sometimes, you know, get a little confused on this.

14:56.620 --> 15:01.620
Things might be extremely valuable, and you have a low price.

15:01.620 --> 15:10.620
For example, air. Oxygen is extremely valuable. Without it, we'd all be dead in a couple minutes.

15:10.620 --> 15:16.620
And demand for oxygen is off the charts.

15:16.620 --> 15:20.620
But oxygen is also extremely plentiful.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.620
It's available all around us.

15:23.620 --> 15:30.620
And therefore, it trades for free.

15:30.620 --> 15:46.620
The primary driver of established collectible category value tends to be a bread.

15:46.620 --> 16:02.620
You have to, for their to be value, there has to be some shortage in quotes, air quotes of supply.

16:02.620 --> 16:10.620
And I think also it becomes a little bit reflexive.

16:10.620 --> 16:24.620
The price itself becomes in some cases, part of the value of the rarity, somehow independently of the rarity.

16:24.620 --> 16:27.620
What are we, but let's just work through an example.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.620
We'll stay with an example that's like you're going to be very neutral to people.

16:30.620 --> 16:36.620
Stamps.

16:36.620 --> 16:41.620
If there are this, not a ton of people in the world want to go at stamps, right?

16:41.620 --> 16:46.620
But of the very rare stamps, there's really quite not that many of them at all.

16:46.620 --> 16:56.620
They tend to be older. They tend to be things like misprints, or only fewer printed, or they vary old and most of them destroyed.

16:56.620 --> 17:05.620
And even though you might not be interested in it generically in a stamp as well, it will feel special to own one of ten late Victorians.

17:05.620 --> 17:09.620
And you know, the other ones in a museum somewhere in the UK, right?

17:09.620 --> 17:15.620
Another one is with some other person, and you now own one of them.

17:15.620 --> 17:17.620
And then you maybe pay a lot of money for it.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.620
To a thousand dollars for it, making these numbers up.

17:20.620 --> 17:22.620
All these examples are made up.

17:22.620 --> 17:34.620
And then you see a story that says, wow, someone paid $200,000 for this rare Victorian stamp.

17:34.620 --> 17:42.620
And somehow even the price itself gets embedded into the rarity, into the status.

17:42.620 --> 17:47.620
Now, this reflexivity causes booms and busts and bubbles, right?

17:47.620 --> 17:52.620
So it's not in and of itself a good or a bad thing.

17:52.620 --> 17:54.620
It's a neutral thing.

17:54.620 --> 18:03.620
But what ends up being the case is that ultimately,

18:03.620 --> 18:14.620
ultimately, I think, I think this might be controversial and it might cause people to react.

18:14.620 --> 18:26.620
But a huge amount of what drives collectable of us is status issue.

18:26.620 --> 18:36.620
And I said, oh, no, no, no, I really like stamps and the stamps are super interesting, and this is a very special stamp.

18:36.620 --> 18:39.620
And now I own the special stamp.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.620
Okay, cool, there's all two.

18:42.620 --> 18:48.620
And I think when you're a stamp expert, you don't think you're collecting that special stamp for status purposes.

18:48.620 --> 18:55.620
Just like when I'm pouring through out blocks curated for a rare piece of genital art.

18:55.620 --> 19:02.620
And genuinely don't think I'm doing it for status purposes.

19:02.620 --> 19:07.620
What I think I'm doing it for is for the intellectual challenge to find something interesting,

19:07.620 --> 19:14.620
to find something special, to put it in the museum to complete the collection, all these things, right?

19:14.620 --> 19:27.620
But the underlying driver, the underlying psychological driver, has to somehow biologically be status related, right?

19:27.620 --> 19:31.620
Like birds.

19:31.620 --> 19:39.620
Oh, sorry, some species of birds decorate their nests.

19:39.620 --> 19:48.620
And when you see them how they decorate their nests, you kind of laugh because it's sort of the way humans would decorate their nests.

19:48.620 --> 19:57.620
They like sparkly and colorful things.

19:57.620 --> 20:00.620
And what I think is going on is, I know, look, I have a special nest.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.620
I have nice and valuable things in my nest.

20:02.620 --> 20:14.620
This is prestigious in the pigeon community or whatever, but you don't know if pigeons decorate their nests, but it's prestigious in my bird community.

20:14.620 --> 20:23.620
I'm perhaps more likely to attract the mate to my nest.

20:23.620 --> 20:25.620
And it's a sign of fitness, right?

20:25.620 --> 20:32.620
I was able to find these nice and sparkly things and bring them there.

20:32.620 --> 20:35.620
Maybe it means I'm a good hunter or something, gatherer food.

20:35.620 --> 20:38.620
By the way, the bird's not thinking any of these things, right?

20:38.620 --> 20:43.620
The bird itself is just thinking, oh, look, sparkly thing.

20:43.620 --> 20:45.620
I'd like this in my nest.

20:45.620 --> 20:48.620
And then the bird's partner might be like, oh, well, that's pretty cool.

20:48.620 --> 20:49.620
It's sparkly.

20:49.620 --> 20:57.620
I'm going to hang out here for a second. I'm going to get to know each other and hear how birds flirt, but the rest is history.

20:57.620 --> 21:04.620
And we don't 100% know why we're doing the things we're doing, right?

21:04.620 --> 21:09.620
We're highly biologically driven. We're highly evolutionarily driven.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.620
But I think it comes from a similar place.

21:12.620 --> 21:17.620
And I think it is a very deep human tendency.

21:17.620 --> 21:35.620
Because we say collectible behavior across category, across demographic, across societies, across centuries, across quote unquote asset classes.

21:35.620 --> 21:40.620
And so there's something very deeply human about collecting.

21:40.620 --> 21:45.620
Collectibles, for me, are not a dirty word.

21:45.620 --> 21:52.620
They're not an interesting thing, a boring thing.

21:52.620 --> 22:11.620
No, someone who is super into restoring classic cars and finding the one of whatever 20 old Mercedes Benz from the 1930s that,

22:11.620 --> 22:21.620
and finding the original parts and making that car complete.

22:21.620 --> 22:36.620
That is a nice behavior, arguably a noble behavior, a human behavior, and a negative behavior.

22:36.620 --> 22:44.620
Again, let's come to the Beanie babies. Part of what people say collectibles when they say it in this context, a lot of times, I mean, it's a lot longer.

22:44.620 --> 22:49.620
It's a fad, it's a bubble, and that absolutely happens.

22:49.620 --> 22:54.620
The Beanie babies were very popular and very valuable, and then they were not.

22:54.620 --> 23:03.620
Certain baseball and football courts in the 90s and 2000s were very popular and very valuable, and then they were up.

23:03.620 --> 23:07.620
Usually, not always, but usually.

23:07.620 --> 23:17.620
These bubbles occurred in corporate backed collectibles.

23:17.620 --> 23:25.620
Usually the model does something like this. Something starts organically normally. People start buying, they think it's good.

23:25.620 --> 23:32.620
It hits the spirit of that era for whatever reason.

23:32.620 --> 23:38.620
It usually starts off with a very good scenario. The beginnings always organic.

23:38.620 --> 23:42.620
The people say, oh, yeah, I like this. I want to own one of these things.

23:42.620 --> 23:48.620
And then because people want to own one of these things, I don't know what this is.

23:48.620 --> 23:51.620
They buy them, and there's no things different.

23:51.620 --> 23:56.620
Where it is with different statuses.

23:56.620 --> 24:02.620
Oh, I want one of these more interesting ones. I want purple one, blue one, red one.

24:02.620 --> 24:08.620
And then because lots of people might want it, when the price goes up and people tell, that's interesting.

24:08.620 --> 24:14.620
Someone's made money, and any babies. And now it attracts certain people who might say,

24:14.620 --> 24:18.620
oh, this is also interesting. It's a speculative opportunity.

24:18.620 --> 24:29.620
And then more people come in, now the manufacturer, a counterparty in financial terms,

24:29.620 --> 24:41.620
the person who's controlling the supply in financial terms, says, oh, this is very exciting.

24:41.620 --> 24:44.620
They might even think of it in a completely innocent way.

24:44.620 --> 24:52.620
Or they could be in a state of the world. People are really into our many babies.

24:52.620 --> 25:00.620
They are valuable, important, symbolically interesting to people.

25:00.620 --> 25:08.620
Let's make more. And it works first.

25:08.620 --> 25:14.620
Everyone wins. More people come into the community.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.620
The price and the rare one goes up some more.

25:17.620 --> 25:22.620
The manufacturer is making lots of money. They hire people. They do more marketing.

25:22.620 --> 25:28.620
They open stores, they put ads and relevant publications.

25:28.620 --> 25:33.620
So this continues to work. And now everyone's really happy.

25:33.620 --> 25:41.620
And usually what happens in this model, because supply is not constrained.

25:41.620 --> 25:50.620
Supply tends to overshoot. And all this cycle works in reverse.

25:50.620 --> 25:55.620
I don't like it prices aren't going up. This is not great.

25:55.620 --> 26:00.620
In fact, really follow. But, you know, let me take some of my money out of this.

26:00.620 --> 26:08.620
And then the cycle goes in reverse.

26:08.620 --> 26:12.620
And then a few years later, everyone's looking at each other.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.620
And people outside are the space of looking at it.

26:16.620 --> 26:19.620
My God, what happened to people?

26:19.620 --> 26:28.620
They lose their minds. Like, how are they paying so much money for this thing that looks like nothing.

26:28.620 --> 26:34.620
And I believe, and this is not like some grand unifying theory like quantum physics or something,

26:34.620 --> 26:43.620
but I do believe, there are generally patterns for when it plays out that way.

26:43.620 --> 26:47.620
And counter patterns. Now, it doesn't have to play out that way.

26:47.620 --> 26:50.620
Even if you have a corporate counterparty.

26:50.620 --> 27:04.620
The Birkenbag has managed to remain popular, rare and collectible for several decades.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.620
This is a very impressive achievement.

27:06.620 --> 27:12.620
This is an achievement of both marketing.

27:12.620 --> 27:21.620
Both staying in tune with a customer segment over decades through changing fashions.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.620
It's really impressive.

27:24.620 --> 27:27.620
And managing supply.

27:27.620 --> 27:33.620
If the Birken bags, if there were millions and tens of millions of Birken bags,

27:33.620 --> 27:35.620
they'd say, oh, look, everyone's a Birkenbag.

27:35.620 --> 27:42.620
Back here, let's make, let's fill all the demand. Let's make more money.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.620
It is almost certainly the case that don't want a Birkenbag today.

27:45.620 --> 27:50.620
So that's the case of a corporate counterparty.

27:50.620 --> 28:03.620
And supply and branding and fashion ability being kept within good parameters

28:03.620 --> 28:07.620
are very long period of time. It's actually quite impressive.

28:07.620 --> 28:10.620
It keeps saying a corporate counterparty.

28:10.620 --> 28:14.620
Wait, how does it relate to the catabor?

28:14.620 --> 28:19.620
In the other categories, the categories that I think are more stable,

28:19.620 --> 28:21.620
there's not a corporate counterparty.

28:21.620 --> 28:25.620
In stamps, you're not buying stamps from the one stamp manufacturer

28:25.620 --> 28:32.620
who will also make lots of money if you buy a lot of stamps for them.

28:32.620 --> 28:43.620
Stamp production over time and across countries and across eras is sort of decentralized.

28:43.620 --> 28:46.620
There have been many countries, many regimes, many governments,

28:46.620 --> 28:51.620
since we've invented sending a letter, and they produced a bunch of stamps

28:51.620 --> 28:55.620
and they produced them not in order to sell collectibles to people.

28:55.620 --> 28:58.620
They produced them for a different purpose, and then some of them got destroyed

28:58.620 --> 29:03.620
above the bottom of the bottom of the bottom. All of a sudden,

29:03.620 --> 29:06.620
you end up with a rarity structure in stamps.

29:06.620 --> 29:15.620
It's very extreme, right? The typical stamp is collectability worthless.

29:15.620 --> 29:22.620
But certain stamps are extremely valuable, and they're likely to remain extremely valuable,

29:22.620 --> 29:28.620
because they're not going to make more of those stamps, right?

29:28.620 --> 29:31.620
You can't change the supply dynamics there.

29:31.620 --> 29:36.620
And other things that have been stamps are 150 years older than they are, right?

29:36.620 --> 29:39.620
Coins are millennial.

29:39.620 --> 29:42.620
There is a...

29:42.620 --> 29:51.620
Well, function in fairly stable market in rare coins, both modern year and older year.

29:51.620 --> 29:56.620
And you don't have a centralized corporate counterparty.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.620
It's weird, right? It's like thinking about crypto.

29:59.620 --> 30:04.620
But it's true. There's no one who is going to now...

30:04.620 --> 30:07.620
So I say, oh, coins are super valuable.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.620
Let's go mint another 1 million Roman-era coins.

30:12.620 --> 30:16.620
You can't do that. You can't go back in time. The supplies fixed there.

30:16.620 --> 30:22.620
Other might be occasionally discovery. Maybe someone discovers a huge stash of supply dynamics change,

30:22.620 --> 30:25.620
but it's not common. It's not, it's rare.

30:25.620 --> 30:29.620
So...

30:29.620 --> 30:35.620
Rearity is important in collectibles.

30:35.620 --> 30:45.620
Of course, rearity is important in collectibles contingent on the overall category being interesting.

30:45.620 --> 30:52.620
And, you know, most of the categories here are interesting for...

30:52.620 --> 30:59.620
kind of fundamental purposes. Coins are shiny, gemstones are shiny, some work in bands are shiny.

30:59.620 --> 31:04.620
Lines drinkable, like you can drink in rare lines, you can taste it.

31:04.620 --> 31:12.620
Right? And some have to form the social construction that they're important,

31:12.620 --> 31:20.620
that the people come to agree as a group that something has cultural symbolic value,

31:20.620 --> 31:27.620
and therefore it's desirable to own it.

31:27.620 --> 31:33.620
The rearity by itself doesn't mean anything.

31:33.620 --> 31:40.620
I could draw on five pieces of paper, five special 6529,

31:40.620 --> 31:44.620
and then we should pursue a rare by the guns, and then we'll say I'm using it in the journal.

31:44.620 --> 31:51.620
Right? So, Rearity is important, contingent on the category being important.

31:51.620 --> 31:58.620
And now with all of that, that's set up.

31:58.620 --> 32:00.620
Let's ask suggestions.

32:00.620 --> 32:08.620
On the left is, I believe, the most valuable baseball card in the world, the homeless wiger.

32:08.620 --> 32:12.620
The homeless wiger baseball card is unambiguously a collectible.

32:12.620 --> 32:17.620
It is a collectible in the positive sense that it is a collectible, people collected,

32:17.620 --> 32:22.620
and spent lots of money for it. I don't remember offhand, maybe,

32:22.620 --> 32:29.620
balancing as can Google it and put it in the chat, but I think they trade at five, six million dollars, something like that.

32:29.620 --> 32:35.620
And it's also collectible in the sense that it is not fine art, which is, you know,

32:35.620 --> 32:45.620
the discussion that people tend to have in the NFT world is it collectibles or is it finer?

32:45.620 --> 32:49.620
Nobody, I think, will argue that the homeless wiger card is fine art.

32:49.620 --> 32:51.620
But they'll say it's a collectible.

32:51.620 --> 32:58.620
On the right is the first rare pepe card. You've seen it before in the prior sessions.

32:58.620 --> 33:06.620
It looks kind of like a baseball or football card.

33:06.620 --> 33:13.620
Is it a collectible for sure? It's a collectible. Is it also? I don't know.

33:13.620 --> 33:18.620
I think people would argue. I think a lot of folks would look at this,

33:18.620 --> 33:22.620
like in particular, if you're not in the NFT world, saying, oh, of course, it's not fine art.

33:22.620 --> 33:23.620
It's a collectible.

33:23.620 --> 33:24.620
It's an as looking collectible.

33:24.620 --> 33:28.620
Main is a collectible that resonates with a certain community, but it's a collectible.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.620
It's not art. Okay.

33:30.620 --> 33:34.620
Hold that thought.

33:34.620 --> 33:38.620
What about this?

33:38.620 --> 33:46.620
On the left is an unambiguously important piece of fine art.

33:46.620 --> 33:56.620
And from 1984 on the right is a derivative of that piece of fine art, a pepe basket.

33:56.620 --> 34:10.620
If this same exact same image had been made by Luca the artist and sold as a painting,

34:10.620 --> 34:16.620
I don't think anyone would question whether it's fine art.

34:16.620 --> 34:19.620
It has, of course, derivative art. It's on the chart.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.620
It's remixing culture, all those things.

34:22.620 --> 34:27.620
But no one would say it's a collectible. It's art.

34:27.620 --> 34:31.620
But it's AA up. There's a lot of them. It's an addition.

34:31.620 --> 34:33.620
They don't think that actually would make a difference.

34:33.620 --> 34:39.620
I don't think that would make a difference. I think if people said someone painted that

34:39.620 --> 34:45.620
in the fine art print of an addition of a hundred of them,

34:45.620 --> 34:54.620
the artist said, look, I'm referencing John-Michel's work and updating it for the modern era.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.620
And here's what it means to me.

34:56.620 --> 35:01.620
All of these things are very clear. The artist is actually doing it, right?

35:01.620 --> 35:07.620
I don't think anyone would argue that if this was on a piece of paper, it's art.

35:07.620 --> 35:10.620
An example of how important art is, it's important art.

35:10.620 --> 35:16.620
Okay? It's art and the only thing that saves a collectible.

35:16.620 --> 35:22.620
And then, okay, if that, someone is made effectively a derivative art addition

35:22.620 --> 35:29.620
and minted it within the Rare Puppy series. Are you collectibles at art?

35:29.620 --> 35:37.620
Obviously, the series as a whole has strong collectible tendencies.

35:37.620 --> 35:44.620
That is sets and cards and additions, all those things. But, individual pieces.

35:44.620 --> 35:49.620
Many of them, to me, are definitely art.

35:49.620 --> 35:56.620
What about this one?

35:56.620 --> 36:01.620
We've discussed this before.

36:01.620 --> 36:04.620
It's the usual example.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.620
It's the usual question.

36:06.620 --> 36:11.620
It's what art known by the session will drop tomorrow.

36:11.620 --> 36:16.620
Art known, and a whole interview with the Mar-R-O-L-E-R,

36:16.620 --> 36:19.620
is it art, is it collectibles?

36:19.620 --> 36:30.620
The creators, or artists, even the term is loaded.

36:30.620 --> 36:37.620
Collectibles are likely made of by a creator. Art is likely made by an artist.

36:37.620 --> 36:40.620
It doesn't really matter to them.

36:40.620 --> 36:43.620
I think art comes as a little bit of both.

36:43.620 --> 36:49.620
What they say is the thing you need to look at is actually the whole project, including the website.

36:49.620 --> 36:59.620
To me, this is, of course, it has a collectible nature, but it is art.

36:59.620 --> 37:11.620
That does that mean that the 11,000th GFP project is art?

37:11.620 --> 37:13.620
No, probably not.

37:13.620 --> 37:26.620
It's probably someone trying to leverage off the value that accrued to something unique and interested.

37:26.620 --> 37:29.620
It's a good purpose.

37:29.620 --> 37:37.620
And, okay, low effort in many cases, like attempts are replicated in its collectible nature.

37:37.620 --> 37:43.620
It's not a clear answer to the point. It's a certain amount of clear answer across PFPs.

37:43.620 --> 37:48.620
And it constantly reminds me of this discussion.

37:48.620 --> 37:53.620
And it's a cliche that I'm putting this slide up.

37:53.620 --> 37:54.620
But it's also true.

37:54.620 --> 38:03.620
Now, the question with the soup cans of an anti-warhol in general wasn't if he was making collectibles.

38:03.620 --> 38:09.620
The question with Pop Art was, well, this is actually art.

38:09.620 --> 38:23.620
He was picking up a variety of images, a variety of thought processes

38:23.620 --> 38:35.620
from popular culture from products and commercial products

38:35.620 --> 38:39.620
and reinterpreting.

38:39.620 --> 38:50.620
And a lot of people then, for a long time, and even some people now,

38:50.620 --> 38:54.620
I spoke to someone, you know,

38:54.620 --> 38:58.620
and said, yeah, I don't like wheelhalls to commercial company.

38:58.620 --> 39:14.620
A lot of people then did not consider it fine art, objected to it.

39:14.620 --> 39:24.620
And today, I think consensus opinion is that it's art.

39:24.620 --> 39:38.620
It is for sure, in my view, art, I think it's like an absurd question to think about whether this is fine art or not.

39:38.620 --> 39:47.620
It's absolutely absurd question.

39:47.620 --> 39:54.620
So the reason the soup cans are here are not because we discussed 60 years ago

39:54.620 --> 39:57.620
whether soup cans were collectibles or soup cans were fine art.

39:57.620 --> 40:01.620
We actually discussed it in the years of popular art, we could find out.

40:01.620 --> 40:05.620
But it was the same class of discussion.

40:05.620 --> 40:18.620
And I think the same thing will happen here, I think, in 20, 30, 40, 50 years, no one's going to dispute or a large majority of people won't dispute that the crypto punks

40:18.620 --> 40:35.620
that are very heavy art elements and also that you're like silly project of the cool camels that people spend three days on is not in fact art at all.

40:35.620 --> 40:54.620
But I want to emphasize, I don't think there's anything wrong with collectibles, I don't think there's anything wrong with collectability, I don't think there's anything inappropriate with NFTs being used as a transportation technology to transport collectibles.

40:54.620 --> 41:11.620
It is in fact an excellent case for collectibles. Just like we've heard, or you'll hear a lot tomorrow of ARTNOME about fraud and provenance fraud in the art world, there's also nation collectibles.

41:11.620 --> 41:18.620
And so to the degree that this is now solvable in collectibles.

41:18.620 --> 41:26.620
It's a positive, it's a good usage case for NFTs. It is a perfectly appropriate human activity.

41:26.620 --> 41:30.620
It's a human activity that they've been for a very long time.

41:30.620 --> 41:37.620
In many different ways, and we will absolutely do it in the NFT space.

41:37.620 --> 42:02.620
Now, we'll go to a related, but not exactly related topic, which is a topic that causes a lot of discussions in the space.

42:02.620 --> 42:10.620
And I want to set up a small panel to discuss this exact topic in a video.

42:10.620 --> 42:15.620
Where does, where does aesthetics matter, and where does rarity matter?

42:15.620 --> 42:31.620
And my mental model for this is the following, that the more collectible like in project is an NFT is, the more rarity matters.

42:31.620 --> 42:43.620
And the less collectible like it is, the less rarity matters, and by extension the more aesthetics matters.

42:43.620 --> 42:55.620
And so PFPs that are for sure the most collectible like of the projects in this space.

42:55.620 --> 43:05.620
Rarity matters a lot. It is in fact the dominant driver of value in PFPs.

43:05.620 --> 43:17.620
On the other side of the spectrum, I am a artist, I am a photographer, I create wonderful work.

43:17.620 --> 43:25.620
Rarity typically is a useful metric, they are all one of ones.

43:25.620 --> 43:30.620
They are all equally rare, they don't have any structured rarity traits.

43:30.620 --> 43:42.620
And so if I am an artist and I shoot 100 by mid to 100 photographs over the next 10 years of different subjects.

43:42.620 --> 43:48.620
There is no collectible aspect there, there is no rarity aspect there.

43:48.620 --> 43:55.620
People will judge them, select them, assign value to them.

43:55.620 --> 43:59.620
Based on aesthetics and by aesthetics I am taking the very broad sense of aesthetics.

43:59.620 --> 44:02.620
I don't just mean like it is pretty.

44:02.620 --> 44:12.620
In aesthetics and meaning and the qualitative aspects.

44:12.620 --> 44:17.620
And I think generative art falls somewhat in the middle.

44:17.620 --> 44:23.620
In generative art you have collections, you have structured collections as we tell you, one of one of those.

44:23.620 --> 44:27.620
But up to 1000 or 400 or 400 or whatever.

44:27.620 --> 44:32.620
And those collections have traits.

44:32.620 --> 44:42.620
And in many collections, if not most collections, they are explicitly organized by the artist to have a rare destruction.

44:42.620 --> 44:46.620
And you can see this by the ones that are explicitly organized, not to have a rare destruction.

44:46.620 --> 44:51.620
Incomplete controls by Tyler Holmes have no rarity structure, there is no traits.

44:51.620 --> 44:56.620
You cannot decide which one is more rare than the other one.

44:56.620 --> 45:01.620
Elevated deconstruction by Luxbridge, again there is no rarity structure.

45:01.620 --> 45:11.620
There is no way to say which one of those 200 is more rare than the other one from a statistical basis.

45:11.620 --> 45:15.620
But many collections do have a rarity structure.

45:15.620 --> 45:21.620
And sometimes the rarity structure overlaps with the aesthetic structure.

45:21.620 --> 45:26.620
In more simple collections this tends to be true.

45:26.620 --> 45:34.620
Oh look, this is the trait that it's gold, it's gold colored.

45:34.620 --> 45:36.620
It looks nicer, people like gold colored things.

45:36.620 --> 45:41.620
There's only 10 of them, 10 out of the 1000 are gold and there's a bunch of those other ones.

45:41.620 --> 45:50.620
And so you link the rarity with also something that is visually appealing.

45:50.620 --> 45:59.620
And so in kind of a simple mode of generative collecting, if you have a collection that structures that way,

45:59.620 --> 46:11.620
let's say the things could be anyone of seven colors and there's 10 that are gold and all the other colors are 100 each.

46:11.620 --> 46:15.620
And the gold also looks good as a contest.

46:15.620 --> 46:20.620
And you ask someone in advance, which one do you want?

46:20.620 --> 46:25.620
Well, if you're interested in the financial value, the one that other people are likely to want also,

46:25.620 --> 46:31.620
taking into account the laws of supply and demand,

46:31.620 --> 46:38.620
it is likely that you should take the hold on if you choose to do so.

46:38.620 --> 46:51.620
Because the work gets more complex, it becomes more like a one of one, this stuff matters much less.

46:51.620 --> 46:54.620
We'll come to that in a second.

46:54.620 --> 46:58.620
The punks trade primarily on road.

46:58.620 --> 47:02.620
They trade second barely on aesthetics.

47:02.620 --> 47:11.620
Air punks that are meant are viewed to be more aesthetic than others.

47:11.620 --> 47:15.620
But it doesn't overwhelm their rarity.

47:15.620 --> 47:27.620
A very aesthetic hoodie punk generically will trade for, I don't know, three, four, hundred ETH.

47:27.620 --> 47:33.620
And whatever the least aesthetic alien is will trade for several thousand.

47:33.620 --> 47:39.620
And so there's just aesthetics do not overwhelm the rarity structure.

47:39.620 --> 47:42.620
But even here, there's questions.

47:42.620 --> 47:49.620
Generally people would say the aliens are the rarest and most valuable.

47:49.620 --> 47:54.620
But here is this human,

47:54.620 --> 47:58.620
which has seven traits, and it's the only one that has seven traits.

47:58.620 --> 48:05.620
And statistically, this is rarer than the alien.

48:05.620 --> 48:12.620
This is owned by gentlemen named seed phrase.

48:12.620 --> 48:17.620
Is this rarer? Is it more valuable?

48:17.620 --> 48:21.620
Which would you rather have one of these?

48:21.620 --> 48:23.620
Or one of these?

48:23.620 --> 48:32.620
This is a one of one seven traits, but one of six thousand male punks.

48:32.620 --> 48:36.620
These were one of nine aliens, but there's only nine aliens.

48:36.620 --> 48:39.620
And when you see an alien, it's obvious it's an alien.

48:39.620 --> 48:45.620
And I'm not saying this because it is, there's anything particularly meaningful in this discussion.

48:45.620 --> 48:52.620
But even rarity is, and these are all, of course, very valuable punks because of their rarity.

48:52.620 --> 48:55.620
But even there, people don't agree.

48:55.620 --> 49:01.620
They might not coalesce on the same theories.

49:01.620 --> 49:09.620
But PFP collections are primarily rarity driven.

49:09.620 --> 49:15.620
In complex generative collections, the rarity starts to matter much less.

49:15.620 --> 49:21.620
This is the tool that is a cadence of the title.

49:21.620 --> 49:27.620
It is believed to be one of the most valuable things.

49:27.620 --> 49:32.620
It is not in the slightest bit rare.

49:32.620 --> 49:34.620
On the right are the rarity scores.

49:34.620 --> 49:47.620
And in generative art, people are very, very advanced, sophisticated, and picky on rarity.

49:47.620 --> 49:51.620
As you can see here, this is from a site called Artical.

49:51.620 --> 49:54.620
There are multiple rarity scores.

49:54.620 --> 50:04.620
In any case, whatever rate is score, any way you score the tool for the ends of 313, it's not very rare.

50:04.620 --> 50:07.620
But it's one of the few most valuable for those.

50:07.620 --> 50:08.620
Why?

50:08.620 --> 50:10.620
Oh, it's beautiful.

50:10.620 --> 50:16.620
And also, it looks like a tool, which is a form of emergent, nomadic, hell.

50:16.620 --> 50:20.620
So it's not statistically rare by the set.

50:20.620 --> 50:26.620
But it's considered one of the more peaceful ones, and certainly one of the more med ones.

50:26.620 --> 50:29.620
And so it's aesthetically rare.

50:29.620 --> 50:34.620
And this is how one of one's trade as well.

50:34.620 --> 50:38.620
Like, you know, it won't say there's all this powerful work of art, right?

50:38.620 --> 50:45.620
Powerful works of art are aesthetically rare.

50:45.620 --> 50:52.620
And so, it's very powerful, very valuable, because it's rare that you can produce something like

50:52.620 --> 50:53.620
credit cards.

50:53.620 --> 50:54.620
It's not easy.

50:54.620 --> 50:56.620
It's not something that anyone can do.

50:56.620 --> 51:04.620
It's not like there are thousands of people doing that on a daily basis, and we just happen to like the causes.

51:04.620 --> 51:15.620
So, even within generative art, you can imagine a spectrum.

51:15.620 --> 51:33.620
The more the trait structure reflects the final piece, the more it is going to trade a little bit more of a collectible,

51:33.620 --> 51:36.620
the more it is going to matter.

51:36.620 --> 51:47.620
The less relationship there is between the underlying traits and how the piece looks, the less the traits are going to matter,

51:47.620 --> 51:52.620
and the more the aesthetics is going to matter.

51:52.620 --> 51:59.620
It's how the generative community looks at these.

51:59.620 --> 52:19.620
And, you know, one of the things I want to do is bring a couple of collectors who are considered to be very good at aesthetics,

52:19.620 --> 52:39.620
collecting and generative art, and others who are meant to be good at rarity-based collecting, and have them shut about it,

52:39.620 --> 52:40.620
and see what they think.

52:40.620 --> 52:43.620
And there's no right answer, right?

52:43.620 --> 52:46.620
The answer is going to be both.

52:46.620 --> 52:52.620
And even one of ones are not immune from supply dynamics.

52:52.620 --> 53:00.620
You can let's say there's a wonderful one of one, some are not capable, and I like one, and it's a one of one.

53:00.620 --> 53:12.620
And as a one of one, it will be viewed as valuable.

53:12.620 --> 53:18.620
But if that same piece was released by X-copy as an addition of one of a thousand,

53:18.620 --> 53:21.620
the individual unit price would be lower.

53:21.620 --> 53:26.620
The total price would be higher, I don't know, but the individual unit price would be lower for each one of a thousand,

53:26.620 --> 53:28.620
because each one of them.

53:28.620 --> 53:32.620
And since a thousand people can own them, it's easier to get a hold of one.

53:32.620 --> 53:35.620
There's more likely to be someone to sell it to you.

53:35.620 --> 53:43.620
Today, when there's only one of them, there's not even a coded market price, because I'm a old seller.

53:43.620 --> 53:47.620
So when there's a thousand, there's always a marginal seller.

53:47.620 --> 53:50.620
Supply and demand matters.

53:50.620 --> 53:51.620
Supply matters.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.620
Rarity does matter in fact.

53:53.620 --> 54:01.620
Now, rarity might be created through the structure of the collection of piece of art, or it could emerge aesthetically,

54:01.620 --> 54:11.620
or it could be created by how an artist organizes their lifetime of work.

54:11.620 --> 54:24.620
But it does play a role, again, contingent on the collection or the work or the artist's mattering.

54:24.620 --> 54:30.620
If they don't matter, it doesn't matter what they're rare, right? It doesn't matter at all.

54:30.620 --> 54:43.620
Okay. Let's switch topics. Let's put another chunk of ideas into the framework, which is NFT-Fi.

54:43.620 --> 54:51.620
Can't say I love the acronym, but I think it's what we've got for now.

54:51.620 --> 54:53.620
I don't think we'll figure out for a better one.

54:53.620 --> 55:05.620
Which is how do, I don't like my second sentence there, I'm going to skip to this.

55:05.620 --> 55:10.620
How do they become, how do NFTs become composable?

55:10.620 --> 55:18.620
When decentralized finance, protocols, or in some cases here, there are protocols and services.

55:18.620 --> 55:23.620
And the reality is that they can become because they're tokens.

55:23.620 --> 55:29.620
Right? So what are the types of things that people think about here? Well, a simple one is workplaces.

55:29.620 --> 55:35.620
I'm going to sell you an NFT, you're going to buy it. There's a variety of workplaces.

55:35.620 --> 55:42.620
But some of them are now working on, to this opposite example,

55:42.620 --> 55:55.620
or there's pools of NFTs and you can be an LP like you are in Uniswap.

55:55.620 --> 56:05.620
People have fractionalization platforms. In fractionalization platforms, you put in your non-fungible NFT.

56:05.620 --> 56:13.620
You can put the tool in it. It gets wrapped in a smart contract.

56:13.620 --> 56:22.620
And it will sell, it will create, fungible ERC-20 tokens, not ERC-21 tokens.

56:22.620 --> 56:29.620
Tokens of that non-fungible token.

56:29.620 --> 56:36.620
It is a form of, it's called fractionalization of the space I take for regulatory reasons.

56:36.620 --> 56:40.620
It's what we would call securitization of the financial.

56:40.620 --> 56:45.620
It takes something that turns to a functional security.

56:45.620 --> 56:54.620
It's a very tricky topic for actualization NFTs. Both from the user experience,

56:54.620 --> 57:00.620
not the technical user experience of wrapping it in rationalizing, that's actually easy.

57:00.620 --> 57:13.620
But the experience of what does it mean to own that fractional shard of a non-fungible token.

57:13.620 --> 57:20.620
I will tell you for me, and I think for many, it doesn't feel the same.

57:20.620 --> 57:41.620
Owning a NFT feels like one type of thing. Owning a one of 10,000 fungible tokens of that same NFT feels different.

57:41.620 --> 57:53.620
And oddly, it just feels boring. It left me flat. I do everything to always try things, see how it feels, see what I think about it.

57:53.620 --> 58:05.620
And the general feeling you had was owning a fungible token, which is fine.

58:05.620 --> 58:13.620
There's nothing wrong with owning fungible tokens, but there tends to be very little emotional value in owning a fungible token.

58:13.620 --> 58:21.620
And what the possible exception for me of Bitcoin owning any other fungible token is truly bereft of emotional value.

58:21.620 --> 58:25.620
So you just look at the price, like price going up, it's a price going down, is that?

58:25.620 --> 58:29.620
You feel a little bit when it's going up, you feel bad when it's going down, and you don't feel anything else.

58:29.620 --> 58:35.620
Which, okay, fine, this is not that hugely interesting.

58:35.620 --> 58:53.620
The part that is interesting about owning an NFT is some sense of uniqueness of non-fungibility of identity.

58:53.620 --> 58:59.620
And that gets lost in fractionalization. Having said that, there are very obviously useful cases for fractionalization.

58:59.620 --> 59:03.620
Something important you want to sell, part of it, you don't want to sell all of it.

59:03.620 --> 59:07.620
And so fractionalization, I think, is an important part of the toolkit.

59:07.620 --> 59:16.620
There is a second problem that it's unclear under which circumstances this is allowed in the United States.

59:16.620 --> 59:26.620
I think it is highly likely that some forms of fractionalization create security.

59:26.620 --> 59:35.620
That's why this is, that's why it's often called securitization in a different context.

59:35.620 --> 59:46.620
And so this, I think, has also hindered fractionalization.

59:46.620 --> 59:52.620
I think it has also had fewer people testing ideas.

59:52.620 --> 59:55.620
It worries me, for one.

59:55.620 --> 00:07.620
I think it's not feel hugely comfortable saying, here's one of my NFTs and I'll sell you one of 10,000 fungible tokens of it.

00:07.620 --> 00:12.620
Now, I'm not saying it actually is securitization, I'm not saying it'll be trea securit.

00:12.620 --> 00:16.620
And plenty of people have done fractionalization, it's been totally fine.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.620
It's just not 100%.

00:18.620 --> 00:22.620
It's a little bit in the gray zone, I think, right on to it.

00:22.620 --> 00:27.620
Another bucket, that's the bucket that people tend to really care about.

00:27.620 --> 00:49.620
That comes from the concept of, comes from the concept, I think, really the concept of DeFi, is people want to, in some way, shape or form, borrow against an NFT.

00:49.620 --> 00:54.620
And that, are using as collateral.

00:54.620 --> 01:11.620
And that is, more more than exists, you can take your NFT primarily in the more liquid collections, or you can take your punk, or your punk's worth 100 ETH, and you can borrow 3040 ETH against it.

01:11.620 --> 01:19.620
Or machinelessly, without a loan application, often with other people lending against it.

01:19.620 --> 01:25.620
And your punk is there as collateral.

01:25.620 --> 01:42.620
And if it is, if it is, if you don't make the payments, you'll lose your punk to the lenders, or you'll either have a punk or solid and get their ETH back.

01:42.620 --> 01:51.620
The major true hindrances in this model tend to be valuation.

01:51.620 --> 02:02.620
If you're borrowing against Bitcoin, it's very easy for the lender or the platform to know from time to time what the valuation is of your Bitcoin.

02:02.620 --> 02:07.620
Ever reply to the earth knows about your Bitcoin from time to time.

02:07.620 --> 02:23.620
The value of 486573 is sort of noble, but it's a harder question. The value of these 300 best for them is even harder to know from time to time.

02:23.620 --> 02:29.620
And it gets worse as you get into less structured sets of NFTs.

02:29.620 --> 02:43.620
So there's a lot of work listed being put into financializing.

02:43.620 --> 02:57.620
Into financializing NFTs. A lot of people want to make them into collateral.

02:57.620 --> 03:03.620
I think at an intellectual level, this is important.

03:03.620 --> 03:13.620
At a personal emotional level, it's a terrible idea and people are going to like cause all types of disasters to themselves because there's no free lunch.

03:13.620 --> 03:27.620
And if you use your NFT as collateral, you borrow money, well, you have to pay that money back. And if you don't pay that money back, someone, some days, will take your NFT.

03:27.620 --> 03:43.620
And most of the time, most of the time people are not doing it with the idea that they're going to lose their NFT. If they thought they're going to lose their NFT, they might sell.

03:43.620 --> 03:53.620
People are doing this as an all-out loser NFT. They want to keep their NFT and then all get the nice goodies that come from borrowing money and using it.

03:53.620 --> 04:01.620
Generally, generally leverage, nothing has killed more people in crypto than leverage.

04:01.620 --> 04:14.620
But if leverage is bad and problematic and painful in the functional world, it's kind of worse in NFTs because of the functional world.

04:14.620 --> 04:26.620
You can make it back and buy back your collateral. Okay, I lost my ETH because I was borrowing against it to buy Solon.

04:26.620 --> 04:35.620
Later, I earned some more money in my life. I can buy ETH again, maybe the price will be lower or higher, but I can get ETH again.

04:35.620 --> 04:46.620
If you borrow against punk, what was C. Francis punk, and then the lender forehoses on you.

04:46.620 --> 04:52.620
And then later you have the money you want to buy back, the lender of the new order might not sell back to you. It's gone.

04:52.620 --> 05:04.620
It is all I don't care earlier than you're the customer for this type of thing, but a lot of people care. A lot of people have some type of identification with the specific entities that they are.

05:04.620 --> 05:19.620
And so the idea of, you know, we have a huge historical data set of both unsophisticated and sophisticated people in the crypto space getting trouble with leverage.

05:19.620 --> 05:37.620
And so once it becomes easy to pick up leverage in the NFT space, people are going to do it because they'll primarily be thinking about the exciting case, we'll make lots of money, not the unexciting case, we'll lose lots of money and their NFT.

05:37.620 --> 05:45.620
And then they're going to be sad, I think, because there'll be no way back in many cases.

05:45.620 --> 06:10.620
The other part that is the sophisticated driver of one side of the royalties debate is people saying like, well, look, you can't really have liquid markets with market makers who are going to make a market for

06:10.620 --> 06:20.620
Fedensas or phone support apes or what have you and have them pay royalties with every trade.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.620
This is not possible.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.620
It cannot happen.

06:25.620 --> 06:29.620
Because market makers trade all day long.

06:29.620 --> 06:37.620
If every time they have to pay a 5 or 10% royalty, they can't market make if they can't market make there will be.

06:37.620 --> 06:42.620
There will be less,

06:42.620 --> 06:47.620
Training and less liquidity.

06:47.620 --> 06:55.620
And so this is actually, you know, I generally think we shouldn't be against royalties.

06:55.620 --> 07:11.620
But to the degree that there's a valuable case for certain types of transactions being royalty free is if it's in NFT collections that liquidity is useful and meaningful to people.

07:11.620 --> 07:18.620
Liquidity mean like you can just like you can always sell your BTC and always sell your ETH and you'll get the price.

07:18.620 --> 07:19.620
You might not, you'll get a price.

07:19.620 --> 07:22.620
You might not like the price you'll get, but you'll get a price.

07:22.620 --> 07:30.620
There is value, I believe, and be able to say, look, I want to get a price for my Bored Ape.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.620
I might not like the price, but I need money now.

07:33.620 --> 07:42.620
And so that's useful if there's a good in there and that liquidity will not exist in a royalty based context.

07:42.620 --> 07:51.620
And so there's been some interesting attempts firms like the Ford protocol will try and separate out the market makers from the end users and say what the market makers.

07:51.620 --> 07:56.620
Shouldn't be people who are willing to buy or sell board apes at any point in time.

07:56.620 --> 08:00.620
Shouldn't pay a royalty in every trade looking for the end user or the collector.

08:00.620 --> 08:03.620
The person who wants to go to a professor should pay a royalty.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.620
It's complicated.

08:05.620 --> 08:07.620
We'll see if people figure this out.

08:07.620 --> 08:08.620
It's complicated.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.620
A lot of people are working on it, but it's complicated.

08:11.620 --> 08:17.620
Um.

08:17.620 --> 08:39.620
So I think in pulling this together, the main NFT file usage cases are, you know, buying and selling them share buying and selling them in a M type model, fractionalizing them.

08:39.620 --> 08:48.620
And then I'm referring against them or using this collateral.

08:48.620 --> 08:54.620
It equals to feed data into the some of these usage cases.

08:54.620 --> 09:00.620
And then some of the things that I mean, that people working on, but I don't think are quite.

09:00.620 --> 09:10.620
Part of the ecosystem is immature.

09:10.620 --> 09:15.620
It's fairly new.

09:15.620 --> 09:17.620
It's not very high volume.

09:17.620 --> 09:21.620
They're unsolved technical problems.

09:21.620 --> 09:31.620
Um.

09:31.620 --> 09:34.620
Fungible tokens are more complicated.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.620
Not much more complicated.

09:36.620 --> 09:40.620
But I believe this ecosystem will be built up.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.620
I think it is going to happen.

09:43.620 --> 09:51.620
I want to stop there for today. I think these are these worthy main concepts. I'd like you to have in mind for.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.620
The upcoming weeks.

09:53.620 --> 09:57.620
I want to say we're also a little bit behind on our guests.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.620
Just purely from logistics.

09:59.620 --> 10:03.620
There's so much to do. And so, but we will get them all in.

10:03.620 --> 10:07.620
We are not going to, we're not going to leave any guests behind.

10:07.620 --> 10:09.620
It won't necessarily come.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.620
On the exact same week as they were.

10:13.620 --> 10:17.620
That everything would have otherwise happened.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.620
But we will get them all in.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.620
And.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.620
Um.

10:24.620 --> 10:29.620
It's going to be super interesting. So with that.

10:29.620 --> 10:35.620
I'm going to switch to Q&A, maybe take 10, 15 minutes of Q&A.

10:35.620 --> 10:39.620
Keep today's session at some type of reasonable time.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.620
Or longer.

10:41.620 --> 10:42.620
And plan.

10:42.620 --> 11:11.620
I think we should still take some Q&A.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.620
Okay, so.

11:13.620 --> 11:17.620
Is art restricted just the visual? No, of course not.

11:17.620 --> 11:19.620
Absolutely not.

11:19.620 --> 11:23.620
Who's making war hall NFTs?

11:23.620 --> 11:27.620
I don't think there's a lot of.

11:27.620 --> 11:32.620
I wasn't showing those soup cans because I'm going to become in 10 of NFTs. They're not enough NFTs.

11:32.620 --> 11:35.620
The originals are in the mama.

11:35.620 --> 11:42.620
I think there was.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.620
There were.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.620
Certain four or five.

11:48.620 --> 11:51.620
NFTs made by the war hall state.

11:51.620 --> 11:53.620
The title is a digital work you did.

11:53.620 --> 11:58.620
And then that was that. I don't think anything else happened with war hall NFTs.

11:58.620 --> 12:05.620
Okay, should the link to us be shunned by all cryptos being priced in crypto such as Bitcoin and Ethereum?

12:05.620 --> 12:08.620
Well.

12:08.620 --> 12:11.620
No, I don't think.

12:11.620 --> 12:17.620
I think it is interesting that NFTs do primarily trade in.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.620
The nominations.

12:20.620 --> 12:29.620
But so long as people live their physical life in Fiat world.

12:29.620 --> 12:34.620
Any token in Fiat terms, no matter what.

12:34.620 --> 12:43.620
Because ultimately a lot of people will want to take their digital assets and convert them into various.

12:43.620 --> 12:52.620
Physical world use this case.

12:52.620 --> 12:56.620
And if you have to pay in Fiat, it does matter what the Fiat prices.

12:56.620 --> 13:00.620
My mental model for this question is.

13:00.620 --> 13:03.620
But there's two worlds.

13:03.620 --> 13:07.620
And one world will be Fiat denominator. One world may be.

13:07.620 --> 13:13.620
Crypto the one of the nominated. And that will happen if there is a.

13:13.620 --> 13:17.620
Kind of circular economy in that world.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.620
And to the degree that.

13:21.620 --> 13:24.620
Crypto unit of account.

13:24.620 --> 13:29.620
It's going to matter in a circular.

13:29.620 --> 13:38.620
More than it's going to matter in a

13:38.620 --> 13:43.620
Fiat economy. It's going to be hard for a Fiat economy to be.

13:43.620 --> 13:47.620
The nominated by.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.620
And crypto terms.

13:49.620 --> 13:54.620
I don't think that's any of that's particularly.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.620
Anything else.

13:56.620 --> 14:03.620
Okay, it doesn't seem like we have any more questions or at least no more were fed to me.

14:03.620 --> 14:05.620
And if someone.

14:05.620 --> 14:07.620
If he wants to.

14:07.620 --> 14:12.620
I think the Fiat and crypto systems will call just absolutely for a long time.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.620
And.

14:15.620 --> 14:18.620
In the immediate.

14:18.620 --> 14:27.620
Turn.

14:27.620 --> 14:29.620
The.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.620
The risk of the crypto system of the system.

14:32.620 --> 14:37.620
But I think the correct way to think about it is that they will exist.

14:37.620 --> 14:41.620
Together for a long time.

14:41.620 --> 14:45.620
Does all have a marketplace not right now.

14:45.620 --> 14:48.620
I'm still doesn't have.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.620
An NFT based.

14:51.620 --> 14:55.620
Community.

14:55.620 --> 14:58.620
I am a team based ecosystem.

14:58.620 --> 15:00.620
Because it's.

15:00.620 --> 15:04.620
Not yet sufficiently decentralized for my test.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.620
But I will change.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.620
I expect that in 2023.

15:07.620 --> 15:12.620
All right, I am going to wrap it up here.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.620
We have.

15:16.620 --> 15:19.620
And.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.620
George.

15:21.620 --> 15:25.620
As a conflict, so I will do the Q&A with.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.620
So super great session.

15:28.620 --> 15:31.620
Fabulous person.

15:31.620 --> 15:35.620
And I encourage you to watch if you have the time.

15:35.620 --> 15:42.620
Are able to join.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.620
Everyone, thank you very much again.
